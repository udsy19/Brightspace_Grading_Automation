## Section 6: Assignment - Real Estate Financial Analysis

### Your Mission and Situation

You're 28 years old, making \$85,000/year, and tired of paying \$2,200/month in rent. You found a condo you love:

**Property Details:**
- Purchase price: \$425,000
- HOA fees: \$350/month
- Property taxes: \$5,100/year
- Insurance: \$1,200/year
- Current mortgage rates: 6.8% (30-year fixed)
- You have \$95,000 saved for down payment and closing costs
- Closing costs estimated at \$12,000
- You are not moving in 5 years but may after 5 years
- You will put 20% downpayment

**Alternative scenarios to consider:**
- Your landlord offered to lock in your rent at \$2,500 for 5 years if you renew the lease now
- Similar condos in the building rent for \$2,600/month
- Condo prices in your area have appreciated 4% annually over the past decade
- You could get a 6.5% for 30 year fixed mortgage if you pay 2 points

**Minimum Questions to explore:**
What's the true monthly cost of owning vs renting? How much equity would you build in 5 years? How do you think/decide on buying vs renting? What is points and should you consider it?

### Approach: The DRIVER Framework

Use DRIVER to navigate the complexities of real estate finance.

#### Using DRIVER to Guide Your Analysis

**Define & Discover:** What's the real estate decision? What are the true costs? Anything not just money?

**Represent:** Map out all cash flows - not just the obvious ones.

**Implement:** Build a comprehensive model including taxes, maintenance, opportunity cost.

**Validate:** Compare with online calculators and real estate websites.

**Evolve:** How sensitive is your decision to rate changes or price appreciation?

**Reflect:** What hidden costs or benefits surprised you?

### What You'll Create

1. **A video** walking through your real estate analysis
2. **Your Python notebook** with comprehensive calculations
3. **A transcript** of your video
4. **Any additional materials** your instructor requests

### Video Guidelines

Your video should demonstrate your understanding:
- Show you understand the concepts - that's what matters
- Walk through your logic clearly
- Explain it like teaching a friend who's new to finance
- Show your working code and explain what it does
- Demonstrate how you verified your results
- Share what you learned - the "aha" moments that clicked for you

### AI Collaboration

AI can help find property data and check mortgage calculations. Your judgment about assumptions and risk factors should drive the analysis.

---

### Critical Factors to Consider

Explore what matters for your scenario:
- **Total cost of ownership** vs monthly payment
- **Tax benefits** and their real value
- **Opportunity cost** of down payment
- **Maintenance and unexpected costs**
- **Market appreciation** assumptions
- **Financing options** points or not

Real estate is about more than the mortgage payment - capture the full picture.

### A Note on Learning

Real estate is likely the largest financial decision you'll make. This analysis teaches you to see beyond monthly payments to total financial impact.

Many people make emotional real estate decisions and rationalize them later. Your analysis brings clarity to what's really happening financially.

**Remember: Real estate combines investment analysis, tax planning, and lifestyle choices. Understanding the numbers helps you make better decisions, whatever you choose.**
