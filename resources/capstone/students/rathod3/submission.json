  "transcript": "0:01\nHi, so this is my capsson project. So I\n0:03\nuse Google AI studios for this. And so I\n0:06\ntold it that my task is to help me build\n0:08\nan interactive AI tool that explains\n0:09\nbudget versus actual financial variances\n0:11\nto non- finance people. Um some people\n0:14\ncould be like managers, founders or even\n0:16\nboard members or just normal people\n0:18\naround us. Um, so I told her it like a\n0:23\ngoal was to um be able to like take user\n0:27\ninput so we would be able to um input\n0:29\nnumbers that we want into it. And then I\n0:32\ntold her that it should include a\n0:34\nbudgeted revenue, actual revenue,\n0:36\nbudgeted expense, actual expenses, and\n0:38\nthen a short context about like what\n0:40\nexactly is happening and what it is. And\n0:42\nI said the output should in um clearly\n0:45\nstate where performance uh beats or\n0:48\nmissed expectations. Um explain likely\n0:51\ncauses in nontechnical language. Focus\n0:53\non business impact and not all formulas.\n0:55\nAnd then for it to be concise as well\n0:59\num and then so\n1:02\nso I sent that into this chat for it.\n1:07\nSo I made sure that was an interactive\n1:09\ndashboard has some visual contact and um\n1:12\nit was like a one-click demo. So once I\n1:16\num put it into this chat it gave me this\n1:18\nthing. So on the budget revenue I can\n1:22\ninput any number. So for example, if I\n1:24\nput 100,000\n1:26\nand then for actual revenue, if I put\n1:30\n500,000,\n1:32\nbut then for budgeted expense, if I say\n1:34\nI put 40,000 and actual expenses, I do\n1:38\n60,000.\n1:40\nUm, for context, we can put some\n1:42\ncontext. So we could say that um, we did\n1:46\nsome traveling during this period, like\n1:50\nduring this month. Um and then I would\n1:52\ngenerate the analysis.\n1:56\nUm so as it's analyzing it'll give us an\n1:59\noutput.\n2:01\nSo it showed us how our revenue was\n2:02\n500,000 that we put our expenses was\n2:04\n60,000 and the net income was 440,000\n2:09\nand then it shows performance\n2:11\nvisualization. So\n2:13\nshows us how our revenue um our budgeted\n2:17\nrevenue revenue was 100k but our um\n2:21\nactual revenue was 500k and then our\n2:25\nbudgeted expenses was 40k and then our\n2:28\num actual expenses was 60k. So it gives\n2:31\nlike a kind of like a chart for it and\n2:33\nthen gives us this and then it gives us\n2:35\nthis AI executive summary. So, and says\n2:39\nhow we are thrilled to report a truly\n2:41\nexceptional month um significantly\n2:43\nexceeding our profit targets. So, our\n2:45\nnet income for the period reached an\n2:47\noutstanding 440,000 far surpassing our\n2:50\nbudget of 60K. So, this represents a\n2:53\noverperformance and sets um a very\n2:56\npositive tone. So, the outstanding\n2:58\nprofitability was primarily driven by\n2:59\nincredible revenue generation. We\n3:01\nbrought in 500k in revenue which is five\n3:04\ntimes our budgeted 100,000. Um, and this\n3:06\nsuggests very strong market demand,\n3:08\nhighly effective sales initiative or the\n3:10\nsuccessful close of significant new\n3:13\ndeals, which is a fantastic achievement\n3:15\nfor the team. And then on the expense\n3:17\nside, it says we did see an increase\n3:20\nspending of 60,000 against our budget of\n3:22\n40K. And this was largely due to travel\n3:25\nundertaken during the month, which while\n3:27\nan investment uh contributed to higher\n3:30\noperational costs. Um however even with\n3:32\nthese increased investments our overall\n3:34\nprofitability is incre in incredibly\n3:37\nrobust um demonstrating excellent\n3:40\nfinancial health and strong control over\n3:42\nour operations and so we are in a very\n3:44\nstrong financial position.\n3:53\nSo someone who like wants this or like\n3:55\nwho'll use it would be it's good for\n3:56\nnon- finance like managers, startup\n3:59\nfounders, project leaders or like board\n4:01\nmembers who need to understand the\n4:02\nfinancial results but don't really have\n4:04\nlike an accounting or finance\n4:05\nbackground. Um someone who probably\n4:08\nwants it would be like finance teams who\n4:10\nregularly have to explain budget versus\n4:12\nactual results in like meetings or even\n4:14\nreports and this tool like replaces the\n4:16\nmanual explanation with a clear instant\n4:18\nsummary of what exactly is happening for\n4:20\nnon- finance people to understand. Um,\n4:23\nanother thing is that we um I was able\n4:25\nto test this multiple times and each\n4:27\ntime it gave me a different summary\n4:28\nwhich showed that it was taking the new\n4:31\num inputs and actually creating a\n4:33\nsummary out of it.\n4:35\nUm, and the use case is like monthly or\n4:39\nquarterly performance reviews. So, a\n4:40\nmanager can enter like budgeted or\n4:42\nactual numbers and instantly get like a\n4:45\nplain like simple English explanation to\n4:47\nuse um in emails, meetings, or like\n4:50\nboard members or just like with anyone\n4:52\nwho needs um without needing a finance\n4:55\nbackground. Um the hardest part about\n4:57\nthis was like getting the AI to explain\n4:59\nthe numbers without using um any like\n5:02\nfinancial or accounting um jargon. So\n5:05\nearly version sounded too technical. So\n5:07\nI had to like change it up and use some\n5:09\nmore simpler and easy words.\n5:12\nSomething I do differently is if I\n5:14\nrebuilt this, I'd probably add more\n5:16\ninput fields like maybe department level\n5:18\ncost or like onetime events and stuff.\n5:21\nOr I'd like let users choose the tone\n5:23\nlike if they want a brief summary, a\n5:25\ndetailed summary or like just an\n5:26\nexecutive summary or how they want it.\n5:29\nAnd then add some more charts alongside\n5:31\nthe explanation for like more visual\n5:33\nlearners as well. And so I learned that\n5:36\nbuilding uh with AI is like about prompt\n5:38\ndesign and iteration and testing and\n5:41\nit's not just about asking one question.\n5:44\nSo I had to define clear inputs,\n5:46\nstructure the prompt carefully, um test\n5:48\ndifferent scenarios and adjust based on\n5:50\nuser feedback to make sure that the\n5:52\noutput was useful and consistent.\n5:55\nThank you."
