  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides concrete evidence the tool accepts financial inputs (budgeted/actual revenue and expenses), computes results (net income), produces visualizations, and generates plain‑language variance analysis. The student also describes implementation and iterative testing, demonstrating a functioning financial application rather than a purely conceptual idea.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective AI integration: a working Google AI Studios solution that transforms user inputs into tailored visualizations and plain‑English summaries, with repeated testing and prompt iteration to improve output. The Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages provide concrete evidence the AI is meaningfully embedded and adds value.",
