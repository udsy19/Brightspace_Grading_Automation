  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial tool that performs budgeting, savings/debt planning, and daily stock suggestions, with concrete examples (income/expense numbers) and an implemented export to sheets plus user testing. Given these implemented features and validation, this meets the PASS standard under the moderate evaluation criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI-driven features (daily stock recommendations, automated budget population, charting, and saving suggestions) that are implemented and used by others, showing added value. The combination of Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence indicates effective AI integration beyond superficial use.",
