  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working tool that performs financial tasks (data input, calculations, and analytical output), but treatment is limited to a single example and brief descriptions rather than thorough, multi-case analysis or detailed financial methodology. Therefore it meets the criterion partially rather than fully.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (Python files calling an API) and shows the integration produced useful outputs, but the treatment is basic—limited examples, little detail about prompts, model behavior, or evaluation of accuracy—so it demonstrates correct but incomplete integration. Thus it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
