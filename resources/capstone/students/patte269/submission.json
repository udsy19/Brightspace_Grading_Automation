  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Jake Patterson, and this is my submission for the MGMT 31000 Capstone Project.\n\nFor this assignment, I built two Python files in VS Code that leverage an API key to enable AI-driven financial analysis. After generating an API key (available with a premium account), the model can be prompted to perform basic financial calculations and generate analytical insights.\n\nIn my demonstration, I used Google as an example company, inputting hypothetical values such as approximately $20 million in income, $3 million in expenses, and $85,000 in cash (these inputs can be adjusted as needed). The model then produced a concise financial overview and highlighted key takeaways, concluding that the business is performing well overall.\nWhile configuring VS Code to successfully connect to the OpenAI API was initially challenging, once set up, the system ran smoothly. Overall, this project demonstrated how AI can be integrated into financial analysis workflows and was both challenging and rewarding to complete."
