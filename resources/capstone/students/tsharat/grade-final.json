  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working financial app that computes budget vs. actual variances, handles trends, validates inputs, and produces AI explanations grounded in code-driven results. Implementation details and testing evidence show the tool performs the required financial tasks reliably, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a thoughtful, effective AI integration: AI is used for interpretation/narrative only, inputs to the model are structured and constrained, and the student validated outputs against calculated results. These specifics and the DRIVER reflections indicate a thorough, responsible integration that merits a PASS.",
