You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a working financial application: it accepts financial inputs, computes metrics, generates an investment plan via AI, and outputs results to Google Sheets (Implement evidence). The Discover and Reflect stages confirm the project goal and that it produces substantive financial recommendations, satisfying the criterion that the tool functions as a financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration in the workflow (AI generates personalized investment plans from form inputs and outputs them to Google Sheets) and produces substantive, detailed outputs (executive summary, prioritized actions, allocation recommendations). Reflection indicates the student understands the AI’s role and value, so the integration is effective and meets PASS criteria.",
