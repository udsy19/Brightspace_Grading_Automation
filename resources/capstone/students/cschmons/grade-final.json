Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides concrete financial examples (line-item variances) and shows the tool taking input, running code, and producing a finance-focused output, demonstrating it functions as a financial application. DISCOVER establishes the domain need and IMPLEMENT shows the tool operates end-to-end.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows a concrete AI-enabled tool that converts raw variance data into narrative explanations and demonstrates the generate workflow and code linkage, indicating integration adds real value. Given the conceptual demo, example inputs/outputs, and implementation evidence, this meets PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.",
