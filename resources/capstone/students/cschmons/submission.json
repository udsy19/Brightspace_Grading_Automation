Um so, my project is the Variance Explainer. It solves key problems for corporate finance teams, um efficiently translating complex budget to actual variance and reports into a clear business-focused narrative for non-finance leaders. Um every month, the FP&A analysis waste hours manually writing explanations for every line item variance. A $50,000 overage on software needs to be explained as this is this is due to the mandatory roll-out of the new HR platform to manage scale and not just software expense plus the 50k. Um, I built a tool to automate that translation instantly, which is here. Um, So, here is the input box. I will paste um some sample variances data. And so, the software expense is the 50,000 over budget due to the new HR platform and the travel 15,000 under budget due to the shift to video. Um I'll also add context for the CFO focusing on strategic impact and risk. So, we see all of this. Here's the input and variance data, input for context and audience. Um, and then you hit generate, which is this part of the code right here, um, and the output appears. As you can see, the AI transforms the raw data into a structured narrative. It identifies the risk of the software um coverage and highlights the efficiency of the travel savings. Um, the primary users are the FP&A analysis and business unit managers. I showed this concept to a friend who is an FPN analysis and they immediately said they needed to buy it and um have it so that way they are able to understand what they are doing without having to go through many lectures and understanding. So, thank you."
