  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and implements a stock-price prediction pipeline (data, features, model training, prediction, and evaluation), demonstrating a functioning financial application—albeit with synthetic data. The DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages collectively show intent, execution, and review consistent with a passing financial app demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (machine learning model, feature engineering, training, prediction, and evaluation) and demonstrates conceptual value. However, it is a simplified demonstration using synthetic data and a basic linear model with limited depth on methodology, validation, or real-world robustness, so it meets criteria only partially.",
