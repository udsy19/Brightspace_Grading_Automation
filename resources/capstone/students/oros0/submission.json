  "transcript": "1\n00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,640\nHi, I'm Brock and for our capstone\n\n2\n00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240\nproject the session 13 I'm going to be I\n\n3\n00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840\nbuilt an AI powered financial\n\n4\n00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,360\ninnovation.\n\n5\n00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,120\nSo what the requirements for this is\n\n6\n00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,320\nthat it must be interactive. It's not\n\n7\n00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480\ngoing to be a report. It's something\n\n8\n00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720\npeople actually going to use. It must\n\n9\n00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,119\nuse an AI language model. Open AI Claw\n\n10\n00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,760\nGemini whatever works whatever AI\n\n11\n00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,519\nimplemented. And I'm going to be using\n\n12\n00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,800\nVO which is part of the app that I'm\n\n13\n00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,640\nusing to create the app. So must it must\n\n14\n00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,360\nsolve a real financial problem. If\n\n15\n00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680\nnobody needs this, just start over and\n\n16\n00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320\nit must actually work and with a live\n\n17\n00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,559\ndemo required.\n\n18\n00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719\nSo for a driver, it's what problem are\n\n19\n00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,239\nyou solving? Who has this problem?\n\n20\n00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879\nWhat's your approach? What tools do you\n\n21\n00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399\nneed? Break, build, break, fix, repeat.\n\n22\n00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,440\nDoes this solve the problem? Test with\n\n23\n00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280\nreal users. E is how can this scale and\n\n24\n00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,239\nwhat's next for it? And then R is what'\n\n25\n00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,039\nyou learn about building with AI.\n\n26\n00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,640\nSo, the problem that I'm going to be\n\n27\n00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,280\nsolving today is when some people buy\n\n28\n00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,159\nstocks or they're invested in stocks,\n\n29\n00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,479\nthey could see a price drop or price\n\n30\n00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,400\nincrease and they're like, man, what\n\n31\n00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680\nhappened with this? Like, why is did\n\n32\n00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,680\nthis stop stock drop? Why did it raise?\n\n33\n00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,840\nAnd people want to know like if\n\n34\n00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159\nthey want to know what they should be\n\n35\n00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840\ndoing like with their stock, like if\n\n36\n00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880\nthey should be selling it or maybe\n\n37\n00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,320\nbuying more. And basically, it's going\n\n38\n00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,400\nto give a summary of what exactly\n\n39\n00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,720\nhappened on this specific day that led\n\n40\n00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,479\nto the price increase or price drop. And\n\n41\n00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,479\nyep, that's the problem I'm going to be\n\n42\n00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960\nsolving. And who has a sol problem?\n\n43\n00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,119\npeople that don't that maybe don't know\n\n44\n00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,759\na lot about stocks or they have like an\n\n45\n00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360\nthey have like their own like\n\n46\n00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439\nfinancial\n\n47\n00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,600\nadvisor maybe that does stocks for them\n\n48\n00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,640\nbut they want to know why their stock\n\n49\n00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,479\nmaybe dropped or increased\n\n50\n00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159\nand what is the approach what tools do\n\n51\n00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:10,319\nyou need I have the um it's a VO it's a\n\n52\n00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,800\nAI app creator and I gave it a few\n\n53\n00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,800\nprompts\n\n54\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720\nso let's get into\n\n55\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,000\nSo, this is the This is actually my\n\n56\n00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,879\nsecond uh Hold on.\n\n57\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,879\nI forget what it's called.\n\n58\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040\nIt's my second like version.\n\n59\n00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160\nSo, yeah, it's the second version. The\n\n60\n00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480\nfirst version didn't have the history of\n\n61\n00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,519\nthe bookmarks. That's why I added after.\n\n62\n00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,239\nBut, yep. So, I created an app. It's Why\n\n63\n00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519\ndoes my stock move? Get instant AI\n\n64\n00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,879\npowered analysis of stock price\n\n65\n00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080\nmovements. understand the news and\n\n66\n00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,840\nmarket forces and whether it's\n\n67\n00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,239\nshort-term fluctuation or a long-term\n\n68\n00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,640\nsignal. So, a aka buy more or sell. So,\n\n69\n00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,080\num in order to get started on this, I\n\n70\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,200\nactually have this pulled up. So, we can\n\n71\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720\ngo let's find a day that would work. So,\n\n72\n00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,159\nlist of the largest daily change and\n\n73\n00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,120\nlet's just do Dow Jones. That's fine.\n\n74\n00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,120\nSo, let's do\n\n75\n00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,920\nlet's do\n\n76\n00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,959\n2020\n\n77\n00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,959\n20th February or that is\n\n78\n00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,640\nthat's March 12th 2020.\n\n79\n00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,000\nSo, what happened\n\n80\n00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:38,200\nto DAO\n\n81\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,200\non March 3rd, 2020? Was that right?\n\n82\n00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720\nWait, March,\n\n83\n00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,519\nwhere was I at?\n\n84\n00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,519\nMarch 12th, 2020.\n\n85\n00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,720\nOkay. And let's see what happens.\n\n86\n00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040\nAll right. So, stock market movement\n\n87\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,280\nanalysis. March 12th, 2020, price\n\n88\n00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,920\nmovement. The Dow Jones uh plummeted\n\n89\n00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,879\n9.99% in one of its worst days since the\n\n90\n00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,480\n2008 financial crisis. So, 9.99. Let's\n\n91\n00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319\nsee if that information is accurate.\n\n92\n00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,200\nYep, that's information that is accurate\n\n93\n00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,880\nfrom there. So, what happened? Uh on\n\n94\n00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720\nMarch 12, 2020, the Dow Jones\n\n95\n00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,720\nexperienced a significant decline\n\n96\n00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,680\nthrough my growing concerns over the CO9\n\n97\n00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520\npandemic. a lot of stocks drop this day.\n\n98\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,880\nThis uh drop was part of the broader\n\n99\n00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,000\nmarket sell-off that many saw that saw\n\n100\n00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,759\nmany major uh companies around the world\n\n101\n00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360\nsuffer from. So yeah, this is kind of\n\n102\n00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960\nthis wasn't just a Dow Jones thing. This\n\n103\n00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360\nwas a pretty much all stock market\n\n104\n00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280\nthing. So some key factors, company\n\n105\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479\nspecific, nothing notable. It wasn't\n\n106\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,560\nreally the companies, it was more of\n\n107\n00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,120\nlike the broader market economic\n\n108\n00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199\nconcerns in the news. market sector\n\n109\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,479\nfactors, CO 19 pandemic, the rapid\n\n110\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000\nspread of CO 19, oil price war around\n\n111\n00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,400\nthat time and the market sentiment,\n\n112\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759\npeople panic selling pretty much and\n\n113\n00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560\nthey think the stock was going to crash.\n\n114\n00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560\nI mean, it kind of did, but\n\n115\n00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,199\nsignal or noise, the assessment is\n\n116\n00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,039\nlong-term signal. So, the reasoning the\n\n117\n00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520\nsignificant drop in Dow on March 12th,\n\n118\n00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120\n2020 was not merely a short-term noise,\n\n119\n00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520\nbut a reflection of the fundamental\n\n120\n00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000\nchanges in global economic outlook\n\n121\n00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,720\nduring the 2019 pandemic.\n\n122\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,720\nand the impact on supply chains and\n\n123\n00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,000\nbusiness operations and potential for a\n\n124\n00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,680\nlong-term economic disruption. And then\n\n125\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280\nyou get a little description, the bottom\n\n126\n00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800\nline, the decline of the Dow on March\n\n127\n00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360\n12th, 2020 was response to the\n\n128\n00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280\nescalating CO9 pandemic and related\n\n129\n00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039\neconomic factors including a shift in\n\n130\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000\nmarket sentiment.\n\n131\n00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,720\nYep. And that's pretty much all for that\n\n132\n00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,080\npart. And then for our history, we have\n\n133\n00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,759\na history tab. So these are the ones I\n\n134\n00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,360\ntried. These are some test ones and you\n\n135\n00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,639\ncan just click on this one. This was\n\n136\n00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960\nactually a mess up. This is just one of\n\n137\n00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039\nmy tests. So I first asked it why did\n\n138\n00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,160\nNidia Nvidia moved down in December of\n\n139\n00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,800\n2025 and it hasn't actually gotten that\n\n140\n00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,080\ndata for December 2025 yet because it's\n\n141\n00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759\nnot all the way through. We're like\n\n142\n00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,000\nhalfway through and price movement\n\n143\n00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,800\ninformation is actually is not available\n\n144\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,800\nin the future date.\n\n145\n00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,840\nAnd yeah, that's pretty much the entire\n\n146\n00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,720\nthing. And\n\n147\n00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,720\nlet's go back to here.\n\n148\n00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,840\nI'm going to finish this. Does this\n\n149\n00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000\nsolve the problem? It does solve the\n\n150\n00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,520\nproblem. This is an easy app. People\n\n151\n00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759\ncould just what happened this day, what\n\n152\n00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,639\nhappened that day, and they can find out\n\n153\n00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,080\neasily what that information is. How can\n\n154\n00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,520\nthis scale? What's next? You could add\n\n155\n00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,479\num other factors involved with this as\n\n156\n00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,080\nwell. You could add\n\n157\n00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,759\nmaybe a should I invest option. But\n\n158\n00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479\npretty much I mean this is already like\n\n159\n00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,000\nan AI chatbot. So you can I I could add\n\n160\n00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,000\nother um prompts to it that they could\n\n161\n00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000\nlike should I buy this? Should I not buy\n\n162\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,680\nthis? What should I do? Should I create\n\n163\n00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,759\na portfolio with this? and that would be\n\n164\n00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,639\nwhat's next. And then what did you learn\n\n165\n00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,240\nabout building with AI? I learned that\n\n166\n00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840\num\n\n167\n00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319\nsometimes it doesn't necessarily get it\n\n168\n00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,160\non the first try and there's a lot of\n\n169\n00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,840\nerror that goes involved with like\n\n170\n00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:26,000\ncoding with AI or other parts with AI.\n\n171\n00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,160\nAnd also it's kind of expensive. I mean,\n\n172\n00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,960\nyou get free credits here, but one\n\n173\n00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,759\nprompt is like\n\n174\n00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080\nI would say like 25 cents to a dollar,\n\n175\n00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,960\nwhich it's not a lot, but it definitely\n\n176\n00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,800\nadds up. So yeah, that was my messenger\n\n177\n00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,800app and thank you so much for listening."
