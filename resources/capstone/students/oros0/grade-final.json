You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly defined a financial problem and implemented an interactive AI app that produces stock movement analyses with a live demo and history/tests, demonstrating that the tool functions as a financial application. Minor limitations were noted but do not prevent the app from performing the required financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated an AI language model into a working app that produces substantive, user-focused explanations (demo and product description), demonstrating that AI adds value. Their discussion of implementation and reflection on limitations further supports effective, non-superficial integration.",
