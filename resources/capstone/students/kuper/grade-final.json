Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows the tool generates verbal financial summaries, accepts updated numeric inputs (revenue, cash balance), and supports data upload, demonstrating functional financial tasks (Implement + Discover). The student's reflection further endorses its use in companies, so the evidence meets the criterion for a working financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows an AI-driven feature that converts numeric financial inputs into natural-language summaries and updates outputs dynamically, demonstrating non‑superficial integration and clear value to end users (Implement + Discover). The student also reflects on practical usefulness, supporting that the AI capability is effective and applied.",
