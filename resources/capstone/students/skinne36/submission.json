  "transcript": "hi how's it going i'm sandy\nskinner and this was my final project\nso i wanted to create an app\nthat was a bot that explained market moves\nin plain english as i find the market very\ninteresting but sometimes just don't exactly\nget and have to sort of use ai to understand\nexactly what is happening in the market so\ni wanted to create something that could explain\nit from different perspectives and that's\nwhat i did so we can see i have this app\nhere that pastes a confusing financial headline\nbelow and it will translate it using three\ndifferent options. So we have the explain\nlike I'm five option which puts it into\nlayman's terms very easy to understand, a day\ntrader strategy, and a macroeconomic impact.\nSo just to demo this\nI went into Reuters. The first headline is\nthat the Wall Street ends lower and fears of\nAI bubble and inflation send investors away\nso perhaps i know what the ai bubble is at\nthe moment because i've already used this app\nbut maybe i don't even know what an ai bubble\nis so i'll paste this into here and you\ncan see analyze this market move like i'm five\nimagine you have a lemonade stand you start\nselling lemonade and people love it you\nthink wow i can sell even more lemonade so you\ndecide to buy new supplies and make even\nmore lemonade. Now let's think about the AI\nbubble as if your lemonade stand kept getting\nbigger and bigger even when you weren't\nactually selling more lemonade. Some people worry\nthat you can't sell enough lemonade to\nsupport such a big stand and that makes them\nnervous. So that's essentially the AI bubble.\nInflation is like if the price of lemons\nsuddenly go up. If lemons cost more you\nmight have to raise your lemonade price which\nmakes fewer people buy it. So when folks\nhear about worried ideas like the AI\nbubble and rising costs such as inflation,\nthey might decide to stay away from your\nlemonade stand if they pull back their money.\nIn short, fear in higher costs can make\ninvestors take a step back, just like\npeople might buy less lemonade if it costs\ntoo much or if they don't think your stand\nis too big for what it can actually sell.\nAs you can see, this is an easy breakdown\nof what exactly this AI bubble is and why\nWall Street is getting fearful of this AI\nbubble and how inflation is causing people\nnot to invest so to look at perhaps a more\nmacroeconomic impact i went into ai and i\nasked what are the three biggest headlines\nin the market right now so the tech rec\nwhich is market sentiment is essentially what\ni just explained um with the ai bubble\nand um say for example the federal so so\nthis is a recent headline that the federal\nreserve cuts the interest rate by 0.25 percent\nto a range of 3.5 to 3.75 percent, but\nofficials remain deeply divided on the path\nfor 2026. So we'll go in here to the app\nand instead of choosing expand income five,\nwe'll look at the macroeconomic impact of\nthis. We'll analyze this market move. As\nyou can see, a lot more information from\nmacroeconomic. So to implement a 25 basis\npoint cut in interest rates, bringing\nthe target range down to 3.5 percent, this\nis emblematic of an evolving macroeconomic\nlandscape that continues to present\nsignificant risks and opportunities across\nvaried asset classes. While the immediate\neffect may be an alleviation of borrowing\ncosts, potentially spurring consumer\nspending and investment, the long-term\nimplications warrant a nuanced examination.\nThe outlook says the cut interest rate is\nlikely a strategic maneuver to combat stagnation\nand fear in an environment conducive\nto sustained economic growth. However, the\njuxtaposition of this rate cut against the\ndivided views within the Fed regarding the\ntrajectory into 2026 signals considerable\nuncertainty. So the market's in a very uncertain\nplace right now, sort of adding on to\nhow that AI bubble is affecting the market.\nPersistent inflationary pressures could\ncomplicate this dynamic. Should inflation remain\nabove target levels, there might be a\nnecessity for subsequent hikes, especially if\neconomic indicators reveal overheating in\nspecific sectors, specifically AI, like that\nAI bubble. So these two things sort of build\noff each other. We can see now that we\nunderstand the impact that AI bubble has and\nhow that's making investors wary, how that\nimpacts interest rate and inflation outlook.\nSo we also have a lot more information\nabout GDP and employment projections, asset\nclass implications, such as bonds, stocks,\nand real estate, and a big conclusion.\nAnd now, lastly, to look at it\nfrom the day trader perspective,\nI have this prompt that Disney announces\nhistoric partnership with OpenAI which\nlicenses characters for use in ChatGPT\nvideo tools which obviously signals a lot\nof potential investment in Disney and\nOpenAI as it's a big collab in two major\ncompanies which could cause more volatile\nstocks as well as a huge hike in prices.\nSo let's see what the AI thinks of this from\na day trader's perspective this is a classic\nby the rumor southern news territory which\nwe should mean which means we should expect\ninitial surges in disney stock as traders\nrush to leverage the hype around the innovative\npartnership everyone loves a good ai\nstory especially with beloved characters however\nonce the initial excitement dissipates\nwe'll likely see profit taking the key resistance\nfor disney is around 120 and if it can't\nhold above that we could see a quick drop\nback to its support near 110 given the\nvolatility spikes from ai headlines keep your\nstop loss tight. This partnership won't shield\nthem from broader market shenanigans. Keep\nan eye on sentiment shifts. If analysts hype\nit up, expect a short -term rally. But if\nearnings come on the heels showing minimal\nimpact from this deal, all bets are off. Think\nrisk management first and don't get swept\nup in the initial frenzy. It's a long game.\nSo I wanted to create this app to reflect\nbecause I felt that a lot of people\nwant to look at prompts differently.\nDay traders want to look at something\nfrom their perspective and\nhow certain market headlines actually\nimpact how they should trade.\nPeople who are just getting started in the\nstock market or care about the stock\nmarket and want their portfolio to grow and\nmitigate risk so that they don't lose\nmoney can use the explain like I'm five button\nto understand exactly what certain\nthings mean and whether they should instead\nput their money in bonds and bet against\nthe market and hedge against the market.\nAnd then lastly, economists can use this\nmacroeconomic impact button to see how\nspecific financial headlines actually\nhave a macroeconomic impact and understand\nexactly what financials mean for them.\nThis app targets a wide range of people,\nand I think the explain like I'm five thing\nis very useful, especially for new traders,\nand I'm very proud of uh coming up with\nsomething like that because uh it's really\nhard to sort of understand exactly what's\ngoing on in the market at all times especially\nif you're trying to understand what's\ngoing on with your 401k or trying to understand\nwhat money or where your money should\nbe if you're keeping if you if you're\ninvesting in your own 401k or roth ira and\nyou're the one putting that money in so i think\nthis is really big for helping people\nunderstand the market and how they can grow\nmoney and mitigate risks and make sure that\nthey do not lose money in the long them.Thank you for listening."
