  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Ethan Menona and today\nI'm going to be doing the capstone\nproject which is to build my own AI\npowered um financial innovation.\nAnd so what I decided to build\nis a\nuh through replet is my is a rule of 72\ncalculator. However, um when I initially\nmade it, I thought it was really simple\nand uh and thus I wanted to actually\nmake it so that people would actually\nwant to use this website and this app\nand to really change um a person's sort\nof uh to really improve a person's\nlearning and ideas. And so as we can see\nfrom the final product,\nthe first um the first page is this the\nsimplest of calculators where I can\ninput any amount,\nright?\nAnd it tells me the exact investment\ndoubling time of the that it takes to\ndouble 1,000\naccording to a 2% annual interest rate.\nHowever, I did want to create to make\nthis be a learning tool for people. And\nso I decided to give a learn function\nfor people to learn more about the core\nconcepts regarding the rule of 72\ncalculator which is you know what is\ncompound interest why the 72 why 72%\nuh when to use the uh rule of 72 and\nsome of the practical examples where it\ncould be used as well as well as some\nfrequently asked questions\nall done through replet.\nHowever, I also wanted this not just to\nbe a one-dimensional calculator and\nreally have the multi-dimensionality of\na variety of financial calculators and\nhence as you can see there's a compound\na simple a savings goal and an inflation\ncalculator. Um just by doing this\nperhaps you could say 10,000 with a 5%\ninflation rate in 10 years. As you can\nsee the cost of 10,000 in 10 years would\nbe this. However, it also tell us the\nloss of purchasing power in the future.And that is my uh product. Thank you."
