  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements working financial tools (doubling-time rule of 72 plus compound, simple, savings goal, and inflation calculators) and includes a learning component, demonstrating the application functions as a financial app. Driver stages (Discover/Implement/Reflect) show intent, development, and iteration consistent with a passing financial application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission claims an \"AI powered\" product but provides only descriptions of standard calculators and a static learn function with no concrete AI features, workflows, or examples of AI adding value. Because AI integration is missing or superficial in the implementation and reflected discussion, the criterion is not met.",
