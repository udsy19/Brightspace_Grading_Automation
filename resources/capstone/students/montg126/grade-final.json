You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application that fetches real-time market data and generates investment memos (multiple stock examples and verification). Implementation details (API key, code, testing) and DRIVER stages support that the tool functions and performs financial tasks, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete AI integration: they implemented an LLM (Gemini) in the app to generate investment memos from live market data, showed multiple example outputs (Apple, Nvidia, Oracle), and described implementation details (API key, model selector). These show effective, value-adding AI use rather than superficial mention, satisfying the PASS criteria.",
