This is Jax Montgomery\n\n2\n00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,879\nand this is my final Keystone project,\n\n3\n00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,559\nsession 13, and it basically wraps up\n\n4\n00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:16,440\nour whole class. Um, so my project for\n\n5\n00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,440\nthis session was I wanted to basically\n\n6\n00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,279\num just create an app that pulls real\n\n7\n00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000\ntime market data um from Yahoo Finance\n\n8\n00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,680\nin my API key and it basically just\n\n9\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,519\ncreate like creates a stock analysis.\n\n10\n00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840\nSo, let's take Nvidia for example. It'll\n\n11\n00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,640\ntake Nvidia, show a summary of what the\n\n12\n00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,200\ncompany is, and then do a bare or um\n\n13\n00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,559\nbull market analysis or like scenario,\n\n14\n00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120\nand then it'll give you final thoughts\n\n15\n00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:46,600\non if you should buy it or not given the\n\n16\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,600\ncurrent status of the stock. Um\n\n17\n00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,640\nand this I to do this I use the driver\n\n18\n00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719\nframework and this is the define and\n\n19\n00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520\ndiscover portion of that because I\n\n20\n00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,359\nbasically just define my problem as if I\n\n21\n00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,359\nwere a junior anal junior analyst. Um,\n\n22\n00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320\njunior analysts spend tons of time\n\n23\n00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760\ngathering basic financial data and\n\n24\n00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,200\nformatting skeleton of an investment\n\n25\n00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,880\nmemo before they even\n\n26\n00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119\nstart their work or start their\n\n27\n00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,759\nanalysis. And my goal for this tool was\n\n28\n00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920\nbasically just for future bankers. This\n\n29\n00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,880\nkind of automates the day one grant work\n\n30\n00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720\nthat would they would use or do.\n\n31\n00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560\nSo instead of including all this\n\n32\n00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,000\nresearch time, they just cut it out. um\n\n33\n00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000\nuse my app and it just bas basically\n\n34\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159\ngives you a summary of what an entire\n\n35\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,159\nstock is.\n\n36\n00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,159\nSo\n\n37\n00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,640\nmy approach for this was I use Visual\n\n38\n00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,759\nStudio Code and I basically just wanted\n\n39\n00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,360\nto build a interactive um web app.\n\n40\n00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200\nI'm going show you guys that right now.\n\n41\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,479\nHere's\n\n42\n00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240\nmy code. Basically starts off as you can\n\n43\n00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,079\nsee as comments. So page configuration\n\n44\n00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,759\nUI layout um slapper for API key. My\n\n45\n00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,800\nname input this where everything's\n\n46\n00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,239\ncalculated. Get data. So this is where\n\n47\n00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,840\nmy API key is included. Um checks if\n\n48\n00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520\ndata exists. Extracts key metrics\n\n49\n00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,520\nsafely.\n\n50\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,959\nGenerates AI content. Um and then this\n\n51\n00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,040\nis the smart model selector. So,\n\n52\n00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,599\nI kind of ran into a trouble with my API\n\n53\n00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120\nkey. Um,\n\n54\n00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,800\nI was going to originally use Claude,\n\n55\n00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440\nbut that didn't work. So, I used Gemini\n\n56\n00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280\ninstead. And\n\n57\n00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440\nuh multiple different sources required\n\n58\n00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239\nyou to\n\n59\n00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,400\npay for the subscription. And being a\n\n60\n00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440\nstudent, I already have the free Gemini\n\n61\n00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,599\nuh subscription. So, I just use their\n\n62\n00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599\ntheir API key instead. And this is where\n\n63\n00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,360\nit's implemented. And then it gives us a\n\n64\n00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,519\nscenario\n\n65\n00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,080\nand then\n\n66\n00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800\num displays results. And yeah, this is\n\n67\n00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000\nmy code I I made on Visual Studios and\n\n68\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519\nthen I'll kind of show you guys a\n\n69\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,879\ndemonstration of what I did.\n\n70\n00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,920\nSo this is where I built it and I'm\n\n71\n00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,080\ngoing to I verified the solution. Um I\n\n72\n00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440\ntested it. I used I mean this one for\n\n73\n00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040\nexample is American Battery Technology\n\n74\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,959\nCompany. I use Nvidia. I used Apple and\n\n75\n00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440\nI basically just used different stocks\n\n76\n00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,879\nand I checked it with actual like\n\n77\n00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599\nresults and just to confirm that was\n\n78\n00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959\nreal and it was\n\n79\n00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360\num so just running you guys through a\n\n80\n00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,840\nquick like example. Let's just do Apple\n\n81\n00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,840\nto keep it simple. So here's this\n\n82\n00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,200\ngenerating a memo\n\n83\n00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879\nsays Gemini's analyzing Apple U. Uh so\n\n84\n00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,959\nbasically you would pull my app the\n\n85\n00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,239\ninstant investment memo and plug in your\n\n86\n00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,799\nAPI key right here.\n\n87\n00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,640\nSo first executive summary of what Apple\n\n88\n00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000\nis, the bull case, why buy, the bare\n\n89\n00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,360\ncase, risks of it. And then four,\n\n90\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,720\nvaluation commentary. Um, execution\n\n91\n00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000\nsummary. Apple Incorporated is a global\n\n92\n00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599\nleader in consumer electronics and\n\n93\n00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,040\ndigital services designing,\n\n94\n00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840\nmanufacturing and marketing iconic\n\n95\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,200\nproducts, blah blah blah. It currently\n\n96\n00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560\ntrades at $2770.28\n\n97\n00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480\nand the company maintains a massive\n\n98\n00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760\nmarket capitalization reflecting its\n\n99\n00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000\ndominant position in the technology\n\n100\n00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639\nsector. Then it moves on to a bull case\n\n101\n00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720\nof why we should buy\n\n102\n00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280\nrobust ecosystem and brand loyalty, high\n\n103\n00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120\nmargin services growth and innovation\n\n104\n00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,919\nand market expansion. And then the bare\n\n105\n00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360\ncases um increased regulatory scrutiny,\n\n106\n00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,919\nreliance on iPhone sales and\n\n107\n00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240\ngeopolitical and supply chain risk. So\n\n108\n00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,759\nthe final commentary for this is Apple's\n\n109\n00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,759\nuh trailing PE of 37.30.\n\n110\n00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,759\nUm\n\n111\n00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,120\nso while the forward PE indicates\n\n112\n00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479\nanticipated earth earnings growth uh\n\n113\n00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,880\nthese multiples are generally considered\n\n114\n00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,720\nexpensive relative to the broader market\n\n115\n00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,199\naverage the valuation reflects high\n\n116\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,199\ninvestor expectations for Apple's\n\n117\n00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800\ncontinued innovation robust service\n\n118\n00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720\nexpansion and sustained market dominance\n\n119\n00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400\nof technology sector implying that\n\n120\n00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160\nsignificant significant growth is\n\n121\n00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,360\nalready priced into the stock. So it's\n\n122\n00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280\nbasically saying that you should buy it\n\n123\n00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840\nand that's pretty it's pretty standard\n\n124\n00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080\nand pretty safe stock to buy. So another\n\n125\n00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,240\nexample\n\n126\n00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,680\num Nvidia I'm just using the examples\n\n127\n00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,360\nthat are shown or we do Oracle\n\n128\n00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360\nis I think that's CL.\n\n129\n00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,160\nSo OCL is not it. That's Oracle is just\n\n130\n00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,160\nnot\n\n131\n00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,160\num\n\n132\n00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,720\nRCL. My bad. So if you use RSCL,\n\n133\n00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,280\nwhich Oracle actually is,\n\n134\n00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,280\nit'll pull it up.\n\n135\n00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,320\nBoom. Executive summary.\n\n136\n00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,000\nOracle Corporation offers comprehensive\n\n137\n00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,440\nenterprise IT solutions globally based\n\n138\n00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440\non cloud software infrastructure and\n\n139\n00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800\ndatabase services. The bull case why buy\n\n140\n00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880\nthe bare case or the risk of it in the\n\n141\n00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479\nvaluation commentary. So this basically\n\n142\n00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479\njust says that while not considered\n\n143\n00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840\ncheap, this multiple suggest investors\n\n144\n00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520\nare pricing a substantial future\n\n145\n00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,960\nprofitability and continued expansion\n\n146\n00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000\naligning with the growth premium often\n\n147\n00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,080\nseen in enterprise technology.\n\n148\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,080\nSo that was kind of just a live demo of\n\n149\n00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,919\nwhat my my website was. Um, if I were to\n\n150\n00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,360\nexpand this in the future, the next step\n\n151\n00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,160\nwould be adding the download to PDF\n\n152\n00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,759\nfeature. Um, this would allow analysts\n\n153\n00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,520\nto kind of download download their work\n\n154\n00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919\nand then share it with their colleagues\n\n155\n00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,319\nor their higher-ups.\n\n156\n00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,639\nI would also expand the data source to\n\n157\n00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,600\ninclude live news feeds. Um, or maybe\n\n158\n00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759\nadd\n\n159\n00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,919\noptions where you can change certain\n\n160\n00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,319\naspects. So let's say maybe like you\n\n161\n00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,600\nknew a new news article would happen and\n\n162\n00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,319\nthen this would affect the market. This\n\n163\n00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,919\nway you could see how maybe\n\n164\n00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960\nthe price would change and then kind of\n\n165\n00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,880\nwhat AI's thoughts are basically if that\n\n166\n00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960\nwere to happen what should you do as an\n\n167\n00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,560\ninvestor. Um, and the point of this is\n\n168\n00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440\nbasically just give a summary of what\n\n169\n00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,720\neach stock is. But to furthermore, if\n\n170\n00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000\nyou wanted to have scenarios or just\n\n171\n00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880\npossible cases that you could, this\n\n172\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,039\nwould be a new way to improve it.\n\n173\n00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,520\nAnd basically after the Keystone\n\n174\n00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,599\nproject, this just kind of taught me\n\n175\n00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,479\nthat you can use AI for basically\n\n176\n00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,400\nanything. I mean just using Google\n\n177\n00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,919\nGemini Claude Chat GBT\n\n178\n00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,199\nand then also all the features included\n\n179\n00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,680\nlike NVS code.
