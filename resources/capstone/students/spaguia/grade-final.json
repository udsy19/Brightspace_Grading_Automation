  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built and tested a functioning financial application for CPG acquisition screening (webhook/API intake, scoring dimensions, composite score and recommendation) and produced concrete outputs (example deal with Total deal score 87). Implementation and reflection statements show the tool was constructed, executed, and evaluated, meeting the criterion for a working financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete, multi-part AI integration (model selection, prompt templates, automated scoring, and end-to-end workflow outputs) and shows that AI materially adds value to the tool. While they acknowledge some errors and surface-level outputs, the implementation is substantive and aligned with Discover–Implement–Reflect stages, meeting the PASS standard.",
