  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it accepts financial inputs, computes specific metrics (after-tax income, saving rate, debt burden) and presents a composite score, with implemented GUI and code. The student also verified results and aligned the tool to DRIVER stages, showing thorough, functional treatment of the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI (ChatGPT) to generate financial calculation logic and code, iterated prompts to expand functionality, and verified outputs against independent calculations. This demonstrates effective, value-adding AI integration across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, meeting the PASS standard.",
