You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student implemented a functioning financial application that accepts debts, computes balances/timelines, tracks savings goals, and offers payoff strategies (implementation demo and outputs cited). Discovery and reflection show the app was purpose-built to meet a financial need, satisfying the criterion for a working financial tool.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes a functional budgeting/debt app with inputs, tracking, and suggested strategies but provides no mention or evidence of AI components (models, ML, APIs, NLP, etc.). Given the absence of AI-specific implementation or explanation across Discover/Implement/Reflect, the criterion for effective AI integration is not met.",

Then you put your current balance, uh interest rate and then like whatever you want your monthly payment to be and then your due date. Um and then you can also do like savings goals.\"",
