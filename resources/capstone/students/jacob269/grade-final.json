  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial tool that ingests revenue data, produces data-driven explanations (identifies cost as a driver and suggests actions), and shows the code running in Colab. Discover and Implement evidence confirm both the financial purpose and an operational implementation, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI is central and functional—an instantiated app uses a language model to generate dynamic, audience-tailored explanations and actionable insights (Discover + Implement), and the student reflects on AI’s role in development and output (Reflect). This demonstrates effective AI integration that adds clear value, meeting PASS standards.",
