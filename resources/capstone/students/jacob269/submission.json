  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Andrew Jacobs and this is my Capstone Project. So, for this Capstone Project, I built an AI Finance Explainer for managers who don't have any financial background.\n0:15\nThe problem is that financial results change month to month, but explaining why it takes time and doesn't scale. So, this tool takes prior and current revenue data.\n0:24\nIt lets you choose the audience and uses an AI language model to explain what changed in plain English. So, here is the actual app.\n0:36\nSo, once you click Explain, we wait for it to process. Alright, so here's just a walkthrough of what's happening. What the output is, and so here the revenue increased, uh, but costs increased more, so profits declined.\n0:55\nAnd the AI identifies costs as the main driver and suggests next steps. So, if I were to change this to, let's say, 76,000 and click Explain.\n1:08\nThank you So, it shows that, uh, when I change the inputs, the explanation updates and it's showing, uh, this to respond from the data and not a actual fixed script.\n1:26\nUh, this tool I could actually use in a financer, financial or management role. Uh, I will use this in the future.\n1:35\nUh, here is the output. The actual code for the, uhm, for the project, as you can see, it works in the actual collab.\n1:54\nI use Google Gemini as my code and for the AI use I used AI to help me with the script and also helped with building the code and making sure it runs smoothly.\n2:08So, that is my Capstone project and, uhm, thank you for watching."
