  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student designed and implemented a working financial tool that analyzes news, produces market-impact assessments, suggests stocks with sentiment scoring, and links to execute trades—meeting the criterion that it functions as a financial application. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear evidence of both intent and working functionality; reflection confirms practical financial use.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI-driven functionality (automated summaries, market-impact analysis, sentiment scoring, and actionable trade links) and iterative refinement, indicating AI integration adds clear value rather than being superficial. Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages collectively demonstrate substantive, applied AI use.",
