  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it ingests tickers, fetches financial data, generates investment memos, and returns buy/hold/sell recommendations with drivers and risks. Implementation evidence (fetching financial pages, code demos, multiple live examples like Oracle and AMD) and the student's reflection on iterative fixes support a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete, functional AI integration: an end-to-end workflow (data retrieval → LLM generation → bot delivery) using Google Gemini and scraped financials, plus iterative improvements to reduce errors and produce actionable buy/hold/sell recommendations (Oracle, AMD examples). This shows a thorough, value-adding integration rather than a superficial use.",
