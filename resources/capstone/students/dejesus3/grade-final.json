  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides direct demonstration and claims of dynamic operation with real tickers/dates and testing, which shows the tool functions as a financial application that performs a specific financial task (explaining stock price movements). IMPLEMENT and testing evidence supports a working app rather than a purely conceptual project.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a working, AI-driven feature (dynamic explanations) and documents testing and prompt engineering to control outputs, which indicates meaningful integration rather than superficial use. Combined evidence from Implement and Reflect stages demonstrates effective AI integration and validation, meeting PASS standards.",

        "\"For this final project, I built an AI-powered financial tool called the AI Stock Move Explainer. The problem it solves is that most people don't understand why stocks move.\"",

        "\"This is not a hardcoded response — it's generated dynamically by an AI language model.\""

      "driver_alignment": "The IMPLEMENT stage shows a live demo and dynamic generation indicating the tool actually runs and performs the financial task (explaining stock moves). The DISCOVER stage frames a clear financial problem and target users, and the REFLECT stage (testing/validation comment) confirms real-world checks and iterative learning that support functionality.",
