  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial tool: it ingests spending by card/category, computes rewards and net outcomes, and produces optimization recommendations. Implementation and testing details (calculation outputs and debugging) show the app performs the intended financial tasks, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates a working AI integration that produces substantive analyses and tailored recommendations, and they resolved implementation issues (error handling) and improved output via prompt engineering. This shows effective, value-adding AI use beyond superficial placement, meeting the PASS standard for this criterion.",
