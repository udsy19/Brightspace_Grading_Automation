  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that accepts financial scenarios and generates decision-ready explanations (live, not hardcoded), directly addressing the stated problem. Evidence from the Discover and Implement stages plus testing/feedback in Reflect supports a functioning financial tool, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI is central and functionally integrated (live, non‑hardcoded explanations driven by an OpenAI model) and was demonstrated with a concrete example, meeting the criterion for effective AI integration. Driver stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) provide consistent evidence of design intent, technical implementation, and reflection on integration.",
