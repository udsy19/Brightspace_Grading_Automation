  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student describes a working actuarial reserve-analysis app that accepts triangle CSVs and produces concrete financial outputs (development factors, LDFs, IBNR, ultimate losses, reserves) and validated the outputs against industry expectations. The demonstrated Discover, Implement, and Validate stages provide specific, functional evidence that the tool performs the required financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration that adds value—automating data processing and generating human-readable explanations—and includes validation and user feedback. The student explains how AI is used in the pipeline and reflects on its role, meeting the criteria for effective integration.",
