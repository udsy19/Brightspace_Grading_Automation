  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a working tool that computes budget vs. actual and variance across multiple financial categories, with visualization and explanatory framing for non-experts (Implement + Discover). Reflection confirms the app's usefulness and iterative development, demonstrating functional financial application behavior sufficient for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission documents building a useful variance-explainer app (Discover/Implement/Reflect) but contains no explicit mention or example of AI capabilities (e.g., ML models, NLP, predictive analytics, or AI-driven automation). The evidence shows app functionality and coding iteration but not integration of AI, so it does not meet the criterion.",
