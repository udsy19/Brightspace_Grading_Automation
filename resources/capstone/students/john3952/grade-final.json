  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: a React web app that displays congressional trades, shows tickers/transaction ranges, performs AI analysis, and compares trades to user portfolios (evidence in Implement/demo). Discover and Implement stages show clear problem framing and a functioning implementation; Reflect confirms integration with financial data — meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete, non-superficial AI integration (AI-powered analyses tied to portfolio context and trade-level insights) and describes real implementation work (integration of quad AI, multiple iterations, API key troubleshooting). Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence together show a thorough, functional integration rather than a superficial mention.",
