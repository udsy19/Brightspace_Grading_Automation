Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a correct financial application concept—building a budget sheet and having the tool analyze actual vs. budgeted results—so it meets the criterion at a basic functional level. However, the treatment is high-level without detailed examples, outputs, or verification of functioning, so it is Partial rather than a Thorough Pass.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly describes an AI-enabled analysis feature and a implemented input (budget sheet) that produces useful outputs (green/red indicators, meeting MML), demonstrating integration and value. however, the treatment is brief and lacks technical or detailed examples of AI capabilities or methodology, so it meets a partial (correct but basic) level.",
