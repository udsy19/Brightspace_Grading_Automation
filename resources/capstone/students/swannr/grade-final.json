  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it ingests financial inputs (ticker, price change, headlines), produces financial metrics and structured explanatory output, and was iteratively refined and user-tested. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows both technical execution and product-level financial functionality, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a clear, purposeful integration of AI (explaining market behavior), iterative implementation with prompt tuning, and product-level constraints (separating confirmed vs. uncertain, confidence ratings) that add user value. User testing and reflective lessons further support effective, non-superficial AI integration, meeting PASS criteria.",

        "\"The app takes a stock ticker, a date, a price change, and recent news headlines and asks the AI to explain why the stock moved.\"",
        "\"So, as you can see, we pick our stock, it gives like our usual breakdowns, the volume, the p-ratio, the market cap, the price, and then on the side it gives us all of our recent headlines.\"",
        "\"In the final version, I treated this like a real financial product. The AI is required to separate confirmed drivers from uncertain factors, avoid, and inventing facts, and clearly state its confidence level.\""
