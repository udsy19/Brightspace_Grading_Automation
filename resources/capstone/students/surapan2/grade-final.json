  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student presents a working, deployed financial simulator that computes amortization and valuation metrics, provides visualizations and financing recommendations, and demonstrates example outputs (costs for debt, equity, RBF). DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT evidence shows both functional execution and substantive financial modeling, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student built and deployed an interactive simulator that provides automated recommendations, indicating AI-like integration, but they do not describe any specific AI techniques, models, or data-driven learning components—suggesting the functionality may be rule-based rather than demonstrably ML/AI-powered. Evidence from Discover/Implement/Reflect shows intent and an implemented tool, so this meets partial credit under the moderate standard.",
