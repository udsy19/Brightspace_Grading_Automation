  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it displays market prices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Bitcoin), customizable sector news, and an AI \"trend decoder\" that interprets price movements and timeframes with concrete examples. Implementation details (Replit + OpenAI API) and live example outputs show functional, domain-relevant features beyond a vague concept.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly describes an AI component that provides substantive functionality (trend interpretation, plain-language explanations, conversational continuity) and states they integrated ChatGPT via OpenAI API rather than hard-coded responses. The Discover and Implement evidence shows purposeful design and actual integration rather than superficial mention, meeting the PASS standard for effective AI integration.",
