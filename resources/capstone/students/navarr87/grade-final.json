The DRIVER stages lack substantive content to support a passing evaluation.\n- Integrate AI: The submission contains no mention or description of AI features, functionality, or how AI adds value—only a note about reusing a previous project. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but no such discussion exists in the DISCOVER or IMPLEMENT evidence, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
