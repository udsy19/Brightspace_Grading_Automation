  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript describes a functioning, interactive financial application that accepts a user's financial snapshot, reframes proposed actions against alternatives, quantifies liquidity, opportunity cost, and downside, and produces clear recommendations—meeting the criterion. Driver stages (Discover/Implement/Reflect) provide coherent evidence of purpose, functionality, and validation, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly describes substantive AI functionality (reasoning through ambiguous inputs, reframing choices, producing scenario-based recommendations, and interactive sensitivity to inputs) and shows user validation. Those elements demonstrate AI integration that meaningfully adds value beyond superficial automation, meeting the PASS standard.",
