  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly defined and implemented a working financial application that generates actionable outputs (financial health check, recommended allocations, monthly action plan, projected returns). Discover and Implement evidence shows both the conceptual goal and a concrete implemented tool producing financial tasks and recommendations, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI tools and produced AI-driven personalized investment outputs, showing value beyond a purely static tool (evidence from Discover and Implement stages). However, the submission lacks depth on how the AI models were used, their roles, or technical details of the integration, so it demonstrates correct but basic integration rather than a thorough, detailed treatment required for a full pass.",
