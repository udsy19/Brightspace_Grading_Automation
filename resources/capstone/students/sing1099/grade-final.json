  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements financial functionality—live market price checks, deal evaluation, total cost and budget guidance—demonstrating a working financial application. The Discover and Implement stages show a defined problem and a functioning solution, and the Reflect stage confirms its utility, supporting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates that the tool provides automated, data-driven recommendations (live market checks, deal flags, generated part lists), showing functional AI-like integration. However, they do not explain AI methods, models, or depth of integration—coverage is correct but basic—so the work meets PARTIAL rather than full PASS.",
