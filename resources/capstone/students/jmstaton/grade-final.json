Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student describes a working interactive equity-reporting tool with analyst ratings, price/time-series views, market metrics, and financial performance breakdowns, which are clear financial tasks. Both Discover and Implement evidence show the tool performs substantive financial application functions, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The transcript describes an interactive financial reporting tool and its features but contains no mention of AI, machine learning models, automation, or AI-driven capabilities; therefore it fails the criterion requiring effective AI integration. The Discover/Implement evidence shows product intent and implementation but not any AI integration.",
