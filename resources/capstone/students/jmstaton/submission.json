  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and this is my\nfinancial management capstone project.\nSo, I've built a tool for data analyst\ncalled Equity Compass and this is an\ninteractive tool that gives you a full\nequity report for in this case the\nNvidia Corporation.\nSo this can be used by data analysts and\ntraders alike to help determine if they\nwant to invest in a company. So down\nhere you can see it includes a analyst\nrating and it's based on a scale of 1 to\nfive.\nAnd this basically gives both analysts\nand in this case more so traders a\nbreakdown as to like the consensus as to\nbuying the stock. So in this case it\ngives it a 4.8 out of five uh 92% for\nbuy 6% for hold and only 2% for selling\ngiven the stock at the moment. And\nthere is an interactive portion here.\nYou can break it down between week,\na month,\na year,\nand a 5-year breakdown of the stock.\nAnd it is just overall it includes some\ninformation such as the current stock\nprice for today has the market cap, the\ndividend yield, the\num the 52- week high, the 52- week low.\nThat's a sector breakdown.\nUm it also has financial performance\nhere in the bottom.\nSo this basically breaks it down between\nrevenue and net income for each year.\nAnd you can see there was a big jump\nhere between 2022 and 2023.\nAnd here at the bottom it gives some\njust some a brief overview of the\ncompany. It gives like a some\nbackground. The Nvidia Corporation,\ntells you the name of the CEO, where\ntheir headquarters are located, when\nthey were founded, and how many\nemployees they have actively. So, this\nwas intended for as a tool to be used by\nboth traders and data analysts. And it\ncan be used for either of those\napplications."
