  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates an AI interview coach (including accounting interview practice) but does not perform financial functions (calculations, analysis, transactions, modeling). While the tool works and covers financial domain questions, it operates as coaching/preparation—not as a financial application—so it fails the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI in a meaningful way (an interview coach that grades answers and provides ideal responses), supported by implementation and demonstration evidence. However, the treatment is high-level and lacks technical depth or comprehensive documentation of how AI is implemented, so it meets a correct but partial level of integration.",
