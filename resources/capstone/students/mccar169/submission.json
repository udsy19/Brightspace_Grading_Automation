  "transcript": "My name is Khalen McCarthy and I'm kind\nof short on time so I'm just going to\nmake go through this really quick but\nfor my house project I decided to come\nup with a interview coach using AI. So\nmy oh my goodness\nthe code I used\nwas\nwith the help of collab to make\nthe website possible. So this is my\ncoding here. I'm going to help launch\nthis link.\nAnd here's basically what it would look\nlike. And it's just to help everyone who\nkind of under any of these topics\nlooking for any of these types of jobs.\nAnd then so I did accounting and then it\nasked,\nyou know, a pretty highlevel question\nthat you could expect as an accounting\ninterview.\nAnd just to show how it works, I just I\nwas kind of honest and so I didn't know\nhow to answer that question.\nAnd hold on, it's going to load in a\nsecond.\nOkay. Sorry. So then it gave me ranked\nmy answer, which obviously was a zero\nbecause hopefully you don't actually see\nthat in an interview. But not only does\nit just give the harsh details or the\nharsh critique of my answer, it also\ngives um what a perfect answer should be\nand how to\nwhat what the key areas to talk about,\nhow to make it sound, you know,\nconfident and also correct and clear.\nBut I think this is just a good tool to\nhave anybody going through interviews\nright now. And you kind of you can you\ncan learn all the material in the books,\nbut you can't have, you know, someone\ntell you exactly what the correct way to\ndo it or how to just be more prepared.And yes, it's my capstone project here."
