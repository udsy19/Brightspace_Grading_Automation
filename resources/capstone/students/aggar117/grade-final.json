You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a working financial application that ingests earnings transcripts, generates executive summaries, bullish/bearish signals, sentiment scores, visualizations, and a six-month volatility forecast using market data and APIs. The student also describes testing, validation, and handling edge cases, meeting the PASS standard for a thorough, functional financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete, functional AI integration (model + API) producing multiple useful outputs (summaries, signals, sentiment, forecasts) and shows validation and engineering choices to handle edge cases. DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT evidence collectively indicate thorough, value-adding AI integration.",
