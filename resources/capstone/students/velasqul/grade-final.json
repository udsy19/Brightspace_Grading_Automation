  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a functioning financial application: it collects risk and investment inputs, performs calculations (annual volatility, Sharpe), fetches asset data, and outputs specific portfolio recommendations across multiple risk scenarios. These concrete implementation examples satisfy the criterion for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows an implemented AI-backed planner that collects user inputs, fetches market data, computes metrics (volatility, Sharpe) and produces risk-tailored recommendations with multiple example runs. While underlying model details are not given, the demonstrated behavior and examples meet the moderate standard for effective AI integration.",
