  "transcript": "nscript\n\n\n0:01\nHello. So, today I'll be showing my uh\n0:02\nbeta for my uh financial\n0:06\nuh planner tool. It essentially uh will\n0:10\nhelp you determine a AI investment\n0:13\nplanner. It'll you ask it uh it'll ask\n0:16\nwhat your risk profile is. If you want\n0:18\nlow, medium, or high risk, you'll select\n0:20\nit. It'll give you advice. Uh it'll ask\n0:22\nit'll then prompt you how much you want\n0:24\nto invest. It'll give you uh stocks to\n0:25\nbuy.\n0:27\nSo, if we put a medium risk number two,\n0:30\nuh we want balance growth, uh we want to\n0:33\ninvest uh\n0:36\n$1,000.\n0:37\nUm it will then uh calculate\n0:40\nuh annual volatility 20%, it'll fetch\n0:44\nthe data of the different stocks\n0:48\num and it'll give you advice. You see\n0:50\nthis the sharp ratio uh how volatile it\n0:54\nis. Uh,\n0:56\nso for your $1,000 investment, you buy\n0:59\none share of Google, um, one share of a\n1:02\nGLD. I'm not sure what that is. GLD,\n1:06\nuh, oh, S&P 500, uh, TR S&P 500 ETF. Uh,\n1:11\nI do have a $294 left over. So, that's a\n1:14\npretty uh, you know, safe investment\n1:16\nplan. And if we want to run it again,\n1:20\num, we could try high risk or low risk.\n1:24\nreal high risk\n1:26\n$1,000\n1:29\nas you can see. Uh one share of Google,\n1:31\none share of uh S&P uh 500.\n1:37\nWe'll do we'll do low. We'll do low.\n1:43\nOne share Google. What? Three shares of\n1:45\nBMD\n1:47\nand uh another share of the S&P 500.\n1:51\nWhat's BMD?\n1:54\nuh bonds. So that's actually very\n1:56\nextremely low risk. Uh\n1:58\npretty safe.\n2:00\nSo if you put that uh you don't have too\n2:03\nbig of a risk looney. Uh, thanks for\n2:05watching."
