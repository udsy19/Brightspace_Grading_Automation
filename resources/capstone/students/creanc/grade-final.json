  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 3 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly identified a finance-specific workflow problem and implemented a working tool that accepts financial metrics (ARR, growth, margins, burn, churn) and produces investment memos, demonstrating the application functions as a financial app. Evidence from both Discover and Implement stages shows problem framing and a functioning solution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI into a concrete tool and demonstrates value (automating memo drafting), fulfilling basic integration requirements. However, it lacks depth on how the AI is implemented, validated, or any technical/operational details, so it meets the criterion only at a basic/partial level rather than a thorough PASS.",
