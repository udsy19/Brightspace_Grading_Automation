  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application (a Fed-statement translator/chatbot) that processes inputs and produces actionable market signals and sector impacts across multiple examples. Discovery, implementation, and reflection evidence show the tool addresses a real financial need, was executed as a working demo, and provided useful financial insights—meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated an AI language-model chatbot as the core tool, demonstrated it on multiple Fed statements (implementation) and showed concrete, structured outputs (translation, sentiment, probabilities, sector impacts). Reflection indicates the AI materially improved usability and decision support, meeting the criterion for effective AI integration.",
