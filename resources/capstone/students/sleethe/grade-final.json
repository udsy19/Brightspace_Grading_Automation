  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides clear, specific evidence that a working financial tool was built (workflow, webhook, structured financial inputs) and that outputs change based on financial assumptions, demonstrating correct financial functionality. The Implement and Validate stages particularly show the app performs the intended financial tasks, satisfying a thorough demonstration for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates AI is central and functional (API integration, structured prompts, workflow automation) and validated by variable outputs tied to inputs, indicating substantive rather than superficial use. Implementation and validation evidence meet the standards for effective AI integration.",
