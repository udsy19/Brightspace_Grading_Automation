  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial tool with concrete transactional behavior (roundups transferred to savings), account integration, controls (limits/multiplier/pause), and reporting (total saved, weekly stats, analysis). IMPLEMENT evidence of functionality plus DISCOVER/REFLECT justification supports a thorough demonstration that this is a functioning financial application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI functionality (an AI app builder and an AI analysis feature that provides personalized spending recommendations), so it is not a fail. However, the treatment is surface-level—there is evidence of useful AI output but little technical or detailed explanation of how the AI adds value or is implemented—so it meets PARTIAL.",
