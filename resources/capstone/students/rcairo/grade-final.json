  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built a working financial tool (market anomaly detector) that ingests market data, generates signals and recommendations, and was tested with backtesting and a user. Implement and Reflect evidence show the application functions and serves a financial use case, meeting the criterion for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates substantive AI integration: AI produces specific analytical outputs (confidence scores, narrative interpretations, and actionable recommendations) and is central to the tool’s functionality. Implementation and iteration evidence (built in VZero, fixed API/confidence issues, backtested with a user) show the integration is effective and adds value.",
