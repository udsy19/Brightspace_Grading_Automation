  "transcript": "0:01\nOkay, so for my\n0:04\ncapstone project, I was supposed to\n0:07\ncreate something interactive that solves\n0:10\na real financial problem using AI\n0:12\nlanguage models.\n0:14\nAnd I chose\n0:17\nfor this I I went based on this idea of\n0:21\nAI that detects unusual stocks or\n0:25\noptions activity.\n0:27\nSo, I took a free API key by signing up\n0:31\nfor polygon.io, which is now known as\n0:33\nmassive.com.\n0:35\nUm, so I took it my API key and I put it\n0:39\ninto here and I\n0:42\nuh into Vzero and I came up with a\n0:47\nmarket anomaly detector\n0:50\nwhich shows its status. So, it's active\n0:54\nand you have a couple different quick\n0:57\nsymbols here. So, basically all of the\n0:59\ngiants in the um the stock market. So,\n1:04\nNvidia, Tesla, S&P, QQQ, Apple, IWM.\n1:09\nYou have the different risk levels here,\n1:12\ncritical, high, medium, low, and you\n1:14\nhave the different types. So, you have a\n1:16\nvolume spike, volatility spike, OI\n1:18\nsurge, and a price gap. And then you\n1:20\nhave time frames.\n1:23\nAnd basically what this is is the the\n1:26\nmarket volume trend is here. So I can\n1:31\nanalyze which I just clicked here\n1:34\nunusual volume spike. It shows the\n1:37\npercent change in the price and it gives\n1:39\nyou a confidence score. And basically\n1:42\nwhat this says is\n1:44\nuh the volume spike of 456% indicates a\n1:48\nstrong institutional interest. Um the\n1:52\nconcentration in deep in the money calls\n1:55\nsuggest coordinated positioning ahead of\n1:58\na potential catalyst event.\n2:01\nUm and then the risk or it says the\n2:05\ncurrent settlement is bullish with uh\n2:08\nand then it takes the active traders uh\n2:10\nwith 8,420 active traders. The activity\n2:15\nlevel is significantly above normal\n2:17\nbaseline.\n2:19\nAnd then the risk assessment moderate to\n2:20\nhigh. So this unusual activity typically\n2:23\nprecedents significant price movement\n2:25\nwithin one to three one to three trading\n2:27\nsessions. And then it gives you some\n2:30\nrecommendations. So you can set a stop\n2:31\nloss at 2% below entry point. Uh you can\n2:35\nmonitor implied volatility IV uh changes\n2:38\nclosely.\n2:40\nuh you can watch for earnings\n2:41\nannouncements or FDA decisions and then\n2:43\nconsider position sizing reduce uh if\n2:47\nalready holding Nvidia due to the high\n2:49\nrisk of it going up or down. Um,\n2:56\nfor example, the\n3:00\nlet's go to Tesla unusual volume spike.\n3:03\nAnalyze it 88% confidence.\n3:07\nUm, and this basically says the same\n3:11\nthing. There's a concentration in the\n3:13\nstrike clustering at $285, which\n3:15\nsuggests coordinated positioning ahead\n3:18\nof a potential catalyst event.\n3:21\nUm the market's uh sentiment it's\n3:24\nbearish with 6200\n3:28\nactive traders\n3:30\nwhich is significantly above the uh\n3:34\nnormal baseline.\n3:35\nAnd then it gives you a couple more.\n3:38\nIt's essentially the the same\n3:39\nrecommendations here. Um but if we\n3:42\ncontinue to go down we can do\n3:45\num high volatility for Tesla.\n3:49\nSo you analyze that 90% score\n3:52\num and it basically says the same thing\n3:57\num but\n3:59\nthrough higher volatility instead of\n4:02\nunusual volume spike.\n4:05\nAnd the recommended actions for this one\n4:08\nwould be review and support. Review\n4:10\nsupportresistance\n4:12\nlevels, monitor put to call ratio for\n4:15\ntrend uh confirmation,\n4:18\nuh set profit targets based on the\n4:22\nboilinger band reversions\n4:24\nand then watch for volume confirmation\n4:26\non directional moves.\n4:29\nSo\n4:31\nthis is this is my site. It's it's fully\n4:34\nfully functional. Uh it's easy on the\n4:37\neyes. I think it it looks quite cool. Um\n4:43\nand so so the problem and who has the\n4:46\nproblem? Just any day traders, you know,\n4:48\na guy hypothetically like me that's\n4:50\ntrying to get into stock options or\n4:53\nstock trading. I can use this um to say,\n4:58\"Hey, you know, Nvidia is looking quite\n5:00quite bullish right now.\"\n5:02\num they have a high uh volume spike. You\n5:06\nknow, I I can I can use some of those\n5:07\nrecommendations\n5:09\nas opposed to just going into it without\n5:12\nknowing anything and essentially just\n5:14\ngambling. Um this is also just a tool\n5:17\nthat you can use on the side in addition\n5:21\nto uh market research. Um you know,\n5:25\npotentially other AI tools. Uh maybe you\n5:28\nhave a finance guru guy that you you\n5:32\nfollow on the internet that has\n5:35\nconsistent returns that you can back\n5:37\ntest.\n5:39\nUm\n5:41\nthe tools I use were the VZero app very\n5:44\nhelpful. The approach,\n5:47\nmy approach was to create something that\n5:49\nwould help, you know, potentially like\n5:51\nfellow classmates or something um or\n5:55\nfellow people or, you know, I can show\n5:56this to my dad and say, \"Hey, anytime\n5:59\nyou're thinking about buying a Nvidia\n6:01\nstock or a Tesla stock, plug it into\n6:03\nthere and and and you know, maybe maybe\n6:06\nyou wait based on that or maybe you buy\n6:08more.\" Um,\n6:11\nbuild, break, fix, repeat. So, initially\n6:16\nthere's a lot here, but initially\n6:19\nthere was problems with the\n6:23\num\n6:24\nthe API key. So, I had to upload that\n6:26\nand then it was able to create the\n6:28\nwebsite. Um, and then there was also\n6:30\nproblems with the confidence score being\n6:33\nrandomized.\n6:35\nUm, and I was able to fix that as well.\n6:40\num until I came up with a final product\n6:41\nthat I think is is valid and and useful.\n6:45\nUm does this solve the problem?\n6:49\nYeah, I I would say it at at minimum it\n6:52\nit definitely helps. The problem is\n6:55\nmaking profits in stock options and\n6:57\nlearning them. Obviously, even the\n6:59\ngreatest investors in the entire world\n7:01\naren't 100% consistent or even close to\n7:04\n100% consistent. Um, and then testing it\n7:07\nwith real users. I was fiddling around\n7:10\nwith it. I sent it to one of my friends\n7:12\nthat goes here and he was messing around\n7:15\nwith it and he uh he was back testing it\n7:19\nand it ended up being um pretty\n7:23\nconsistently profitable. um not nothing\n7:25\ncrazy, you know, not 800% returns or\n7:28\nanything that you might get with uh zero\n7:32\nDTE spy calls, for example, where you're\n7:35\nessentially just gambling.\n7:38\nUm how can this scale?\n7:41\nSo\n7:43\njust further further messing with the\n7:45\nAI. Um potentially putting in more\n7:48\nstocks. Um\n7:51\nmaybe adding um a ton of historical data\n7:56\nto it. Uh maybe allowing a back test\n7:59\nmodel.\n8:01\nAnd then what did I learn?\n8:04\nI learned that building with AI, as long\n8:06\nas you know how to use the prompts\n8:07\ncorrectly,\n8:09\num you can pretty much do anything. And\n8:13\nI I learned that AI is extremely helpful\n8:17\nand um if if you know your way around it\n8:21\nuh through like prompt engineering and\n8:23\nand such, you will be way ahead of the\n8:26\npack. Um, even even if every single one\n8:30\nof your other classmates or or uh\n8:32\nco-workers or whatever is using AI, as\n8:34\nlong as you know how to use it correctly\n8:36\nusing the driver model, you will be\n8:38\nahead.\n8:42\nUm, so like I said, I used the I I I\n8:46\nused AI to detect unusual stock or\n8:48\noption activity.\n8:50\nUm,\n8:53\nand I showed you the live demo. Um, I\n8:56\nused AI with it and the the real\n8:59\nfunctionality it it really is\n9:01\nfunctional. Um, I can name specific\n9:04\npeople that want this. I already said\n9:06\nco-workers, classmates, parents,\n9:09\num,\n9:12\nteachers, really anybody can use this.\n9:14\nif if they have, you know, even 1% of\n9:18\ntheir yearly income that they can put\n9:20\ninto this uh to put into the stock\n9:22\nmarket, they can use this tool um to\n9:25\nmake way more informed responses uh and\n9:28\ndecisions.\n9:30\nI have tested it with myself and I\n9:31\ntested with my friend um and there is a\n9:35\nclear case use. you you use this to\n9:40\num\n9:42\nto help yourself uh financially. Um\n9:47\nand\n9:49\nI showed the demo.\n9:51\nUm and explaining what was hard. What\n9:56\nwas hard initially\n9:58\nwas\n10:00\nfiguring out exactly what I wanted in\n10:03\nthis.\n10:04\nUm, and I went through a couple uh\n10:08\ntroubleshoots.\n10:09\nUm, originally the VZero app just\n10:12\ndisplayed a black screen with nothing.\n10:16\nSo, I explained that and it was able to\n10:18\nsolve that and then it said the API key\n10:21\nwas an issue. So, I made an account um\n10:24\nthrough massive.com and I got my API\n10:26\nkey. Um,\n10:32\nI know what I would do differently.\n10:34\nUm,\n10:38\nI would say\n10:40\npotentially adding more\n10:44\ninformation like other other stocks like\n10:47\nsnow for Snowflake or uh potentially\n10:51\ndividing it between sectors as well like\n10:54\ntech\n10:56\num you know oil and gas, energy\n11:00\ncompanies. Maybe maybe I would do that.\n11:03\nAnd I I do understand the the build\n11:05\nprocess for that as I had to\n11:07\ntroubleshoot a few times.\n11:10\nUm I learned how to use API uh API keys,\n11:15\nhow to build interfaces,\n11:17\nhow to handle data,\n11:19\nand I learned uh how to get unstuck\n11:21\nthrough troubleshooting.\n11:23\nUm so yeah, just as a reminder, I can\n11:27\nscan for anomalies.\n11:29\nI can choose\n11:31\nuh unusual\n11:34\nuh volume spike or you know the the open\n11:37\nprice surge for Nvidia. I can run that.\n11:41\nThis one's very confident.\n11:43\nUm\n11:46\nso in the end that's my capstone\n11:48\nproject. Um this class has been very\n11:51\nintuitive and and very very helpful. Um,\n11:55\nI I like the AI um direction\n12:00\nuh that you're taking this class. Um,\n12:04\nand and other classes that you teach.\n12:07\nUm, I I\n12:09\nyou know, I really do just think it's\n12:11\nit's it's a good direction to go,\n12:13\nespecially with when when I was a senior\n12:16\nin high school, uh, in 2022, Chat GBT,\n12:20\nuh, I think had just come out and it was\n12:23\nkind of a joke. Uh, you know, it would\n12:25\nget simple algebraic equations wrong. Um\n12:31\nand now with in 2025 with how far AI has\n12:35\nbecome, I think learning the driver\n12:37\nmodel and uh learning how to create uh\n12:41\nfor example an NAI uh stock detection\n12:44\num stock and option um detection uh\n12:49\nthrough an app like V0ero.\n12:52\nI think that's very a very important\n12:54\nskill that will translate over into the\n12:58\nreal world. um after I graduate and get\n13:01\na job at some sort of financial\n13:03\ninstitution. But yeah, overall that's my\n13:05capstone project."
