  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application: a published GPT positioned as a financial analyst assistant that performs domain tasks (market explanations, WACC/CAPM calculations) and was iteratively developed and tested. The Discover and Implement stages show purpose and deployment, supporting a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a functioning AI tool (published GPT) that provides domain-specific explanations, worked solutions, visualizations, and was user-tested, indicating AI adds real instructional value. The student also reflected on implementation tradeoffs (prompt engineering), supporting that AI was meaningfully integrated rather than superficial.",
