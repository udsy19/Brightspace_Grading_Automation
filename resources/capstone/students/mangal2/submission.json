  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Arian and today I'm going\n0:04\nto be recording my um capsum project. So\n0:07\nI'll go over quickly the rubric. I made\n0:09\na little driver document over here which\n0:10\nwill discover I'll go over my driver\n0:12\nprocess of doing this and then I'll go\n0:14\nover and demo our project as well. So\n0:16\nbasically there's a lot of stuff in the\n0:18\nrubric but it's just basically meant to\n0:20\nbe like an AI powered finance app which\n0:22\nshows that I've understood AI and\n0:23\nfinance semester. It's practice for my\n0:25\nactual career. It's interactive. solve\n0:27\nthe finance problem must actually work\n0:29\nand it must have some actual uh live use\n0:32\ncase.\n0:33\nSo, and it's meant to be like a more um\n0:36\npersonal. So, I'll go over what I made.\n0:39\nSo, I'll talk about first the problem\n0:40\nthat I'm trying to solve and then I'll\n0:41\ntalk about what I made. So, I wanted to\n0:43\nsolve the problem of capital allocation\n0:45\nwhich is something that we came across a\n0:46\nlot this semester which is that when a\n0:49\ncompany's excess cash there's a lot of\n0:50\ndecisions that had to be made in our\n0:52\nsession assignments of our WBAs. We made\n0:54\na lot of videos basically talking about\n0:55\na lot of these situations. Should we\n0:57\nrepurchase shares? Should we pay\n0:58\ndividends? Should we pay debt? Should we\n0:59\nreinvest in growth um and these are\n1:02\nreally fundamental decisions that I\n1:04\nobviously see that get reduced down to\n1:05\nvery small um objects and they're very\n1:08\nlimited. And what I learned in this\n1:10\nsemester is that a lot of this is done\n1:12\nin spreadsheets and like Google slides.\n1:15\nBut by using AI in the semester, I kind\n1:16\nof realized how big of an impact it had\n1:19\non my like decision- making process,\n1:21\nthought making process and overall\n1:23\nprocess uh qualitatively evaluating\n1:26\nthis. So I wanted to make a tool with AI\n1:30\nthat could solve this. So the people\n1:31\nthat would use this tool would be\n1:32\ncorporate finance teams, CFO strategy\n1:34\nteams, public company investors, and\n1:36\nanalysts evaluating buybacks versus\n1:38\ninvestments or founders managing cash.\n1:40\nSo I'm I built a tool that helps users\n1:43\nallocate capital across uses see impacts\n1:45\nof finance and then receive AI generated\n1:48\nreasoning explaining value creation\n1:50\nvalue transfer stakeholder winner or\n1:51\nlosers risks and signals. So first I\n1:54\ndesigned it around two layers which is\n1:55\nnumber one a financial engine using EPS\n1:57\nmechanics leverage changes PE implied\n1:59\npricing roe net leverage walk all stuff\n2:02\nthat we learned in the course um as a\n2:04\nfinancial layer and then an AI layer\n2:06\nwhich we're using Gemini 2.5 blaster for\n2:08\nwhich we interpret the results explain\n2:09\nthe numerical in plain English flag\n2:11\nproblems and then produce inside the\n2:13\nspreadsheet cat. So it remains very\n2:16\ngrounded and a very um\n2:20\nholistic kind of tool. So we and I I\n2:23\nmade it um like a very boilerplate name\n2:25\nof AI capital allocation pilot. So the\n2:27\nuser controls the inputs of cash\n2:29\navailable, total debt, shares price,\n2:31\nshares outstanding, net income, interest\n2:33\nrate on debt, lock and expected\n2:34\ninvestment, ROIC, and they can control\n2:37\nthe capital allocation based on what\n2:38\nthey want up to 100% using sliders for\n2:41\nshare buybacks, special dividends, debt\n2:43\npayown, and reinvestment. And the\n2:44\ninterface ensures that it's 100%\n2:46\nallocated, which is like a real world\n2:48\nconstraint. And as a slider move, the\n2:49\nmodel updates the following EPS, implied\n2:51\nshare price, net leverage, and ROE. So\n2:53\nyou get immediate results, right? And\n2:56\nthis is the first time. This was manual.\n2:57\nYou can find a way to do this in Excel\n2:59\nas well. But what really sets it apart\n3:00\nis the AI. So the AI will analyze your\n3:02\nchosen allocation and generate an\n3:04\nassessment of the strategy,\n3:05\nidentification of the value transfer and\n3:06\nvalue creation, impact analysis and\n3:08\nconsiderations. So it's it's more than\n3:10\njust finance or math. It's finance and\n3:12\nreasoning supplied with the details. So\n3:15\nnow we'll validate if it works and I'll\n3:17\nshow you again how the inputs run\n3:18\ncorrectly. Financial metrics adjust, AI\n3:20\noutputs adjust, etc. And how it solves\n3:22\nthe problem.\n3:24\nSo as you can see this is the AI capital\n3:25\nallocation co-pilot powered by Gemini\n3:27\n2.5 flash. We can adjust this cash\n3:30\navailable in millions to 520 or 500 debt\n3:32\ndown to 190 share price down two shares\n3:35\nat setting one. We can increase the net\n3:38\nincome the whack percentage rate the\n3:39\nROIC percentage rate and then the\n3:41\ninterest rate of debt. So as you can see\n3:42\nthese are all um labeled data points. So\n3:46\nthis is from your balance sheet. This\n3:47\nwould be the market data. This would be\n3:48\nassumptions that you make or assumptions\n3:50\nthat you have based on data. This is\n3:51\nwhere the capital allocation strategy\n3:52\nthey talk about comes in where you say\n3:54\nfully allocated. So let's say I remove\n3:55\nthis. Now I'm not fully allocated. Here\n3:57\nI'm fully allocated but here I'm 50%\n4:00\nunallocated. So this is around share\n4:01\nbuybacks, returning cash to\n4:03\nshareholders, delever my balance sheet\n4:05\nor reinvesting capex growth. And it'll\n4:07\nshow me the dollar values here as well\n4:08\nas like a little nice pie chart. So you\n4:10\ncan see the pie chart also um the\n4:12\nnumbers are on the pie chart change as I\n4:14\nincrease the share count and those like\n4:16\npercentages change. So now this\n4:17\npercentage goes down because it's 0%\n4:19\nit's gone. There's nothing here. It's\n4:21\nunallocated. And now I increase it. And\n4:23\nboom, it's allocated to the special\n4:25\ndividend. So, this makes it a lot more\n4:26\neasier to visualize your um thing. And\n4:28\nthis is the impact post transaction of\n4:31\neverything that you're plotting out,\n4:32\nyour EPS earnings, which we can see\n4:34\nplotted nicely, 8.4% increased, implied\n4:37\nshare price, ROE, and then your net\n4:39\nleverage goes down or goes up, etc. And\n4:42\nthen you can also see that on a graph\n4:43\ncompared to your previous one, which is\n4:44\na bit off. And this is the big thing,\n4:46\nwhich is the AI co-pilot analysis.\n4:49\nSo I'll press update analysis, but the\n4:51\nanalysis won't be updated because it's\n4:52\nthe same allocation but slightly\n4:55\ndifferent numbers. So we'll wait for\n4:58\nGemini 2.5 to come up with this. And\n5:01\nthis is done via an API, the Gemini 2.5\n5:03\nAPI, and it gives us these four. So\n5:05\nwe'll go over what each four is. First\n5:07\nis the allocation strategy signals. And\n5:10\nthis one we can see is a high confident\n5:11\napproach to capital management with\n5:13\nbalance distribution and a lot of other\n5:15\nstuff which is basically just showing\n5:16\nthat it's a good highly disciplined\n5:18\nconfident approach. Um they are the\n5:21\nwinners in this which are the\n5:21\nshareholders long term um they improve\n5:24\nvia financial stability per share\n5:26\nmetrics while short-term are directly\n5:29\nrewarded by the onetime dividend yield\n5:30\nas well as bond holders get limited\n5:32\nbecause the leverage gets reduced. So as\n5:33\nyou can see this model all the winners\n5:35\nand losers of the situation no losers\n5:36\nand key financial risks include the\n5:38\nexist uh execution risk of the $130\n5:40\nmillion investment over here and we may\n5:43\nnot achieve the 12.1% that's a risk\n5:45\nthere's also buyback timing risk there's\n5:47\nother risks that it comes up and finally\n5:49\nthe agency issues which are like um\n5:51\nimprovements in these uh ratios present\n5:54\npotential for agency conflict so this is\n5:56\nidentifying how the numbers might cause\n5:58\nproblems in your company. So if you\n6:00\nthink about it in the issues that\n6:02\nregular people have from a spreadsheet,\n6:04\nthere's no way you'd be able to gauge\n6:05\nhow it affect your company, your\n6:06\nrelationships, and your employees. This\n6:08\nis able to outline that with AI. And\n6:10\nlet's say we change this. So we say we\n6:12\nreduce the shares to 5%, we increase the\n6:13\ncash, uh, and then we increase the debt\n6:16\npaid out for example, fully update. Now\n6:18\nwe update our analysis. Now give that a\n6:20\nsec. And it'll give us different values.\n6:25\nAs you can see, these values also change\n6:27\nin real time.\n6:29\nWell, over here. Yeah. So, as you can\n6:31\nsee, these are different uh values. Now,\n6:33\nthis one is more of a balanced approach\n6:35\nwith financial risking and balance\n6:37\nsheet. So, it's identified here. The\n6:39\nbond holders are identified as the\n6:40\nbiggest winners, then long-term\n6:42\nshareholders. And then finally, share\n6:44\nshort-term shareholders. So, it's a bit\n6:45\ndifferent than the previous one. Our\n6:46\nrisk flags are different in terms of the\n6:48\n12.1% on the invest capital. And there's\n6:51\na lot of agency issues in this one that\n6:53\ncome up. So as you can see this is a\n6:54\ncompletely different number set and a\n6:56\ncompletely different allocation set\n6:58\nwhich gave us a different AI core pilot\n6:59\nanalysis of our values and overall kind\n7:02\nof change. So I'll talk about what I\n7:04\nwant to evolve and then I'll finish it\n7:05\noff. So number one I want to obviously\n7:07\nfix the UI stuff. So as you can see the\n7:09\nsliders here don't line up with the U\n7:10\nthing. So while they are accurate to the\n7:13\npercent they aren't accurate to this\n7:15\nlike bubble that looks kind of awkward.\n7:17\nUm I want to fix this. As you can see,\n7:19\nthis is down, but should still should be\n7:21\nred, but they're the same color, which\n7:22\nkind of signifies differently. And I\n7:24\nwant to just improve this so it fits on\n7:25\nthe page and it's kind of in the same\n7:26\nbox, etc., etc., but and those are just\n7:28\nUI changes. And overall, I want to add\n7:30\nscenario analysis, capital allocation,\n7:32\nslide exports, integration with\n7:34\nfinancial statements, like an upload\n7:35\nbutton for your financial statements.\n7:37\nYou don't have to type it in over here,\n7:38\nbut rather just upload whatever your\n7:40\ndocs are. And then DCF based value\n7:42\ncomparisons. That's how we're going to\n7:44\nevolve this model. But finally, to\n7:45\nreflect, building something real is\n7:46\nharder than solving problem sets. uh the\n7:48\nfinancial assumptions must be explicit\n7:50\nor the AI is really uncredible and\n7:52\nreally not accurate. Uh AI is most\n7:54\npowerful when used as a reasoning layer\n7:55\nbut not like the only reasoning layer.\n7:57\nSo you're feeding it a lot of data that\n7:58\nhas been vetted, verified and solved by\n8:00\na human and then just asking it to help\n8:02\nyou on top. So instead of making AI go\n8:04\nfrom zero to 100, you're making it go\n8:05\nfrom 90 to 100, which is a lot\n8:06\ndifferent. And finally, you have to be\n8:08\nable to translate financial into a\n8:10\nusable product with good prompting. So\n8:12\nhaving like Gemini actually prompt\n8:14\nproperly to give you like a good idea.\n8:15\nAnd this is overall a tool that can be\n8:17\nused outside of class and I will use\n8:18\noutside of class to help me with my um\n8:20with my work. So thank you."
