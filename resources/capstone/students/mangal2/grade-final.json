  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application that performs concrete financial tasks (capital allocation, recalculating EPS/price/leverages) and integrates AI analysis via an API. The Discover and Implement stages provide specific evidence of purpose and implementation, and the Reflect stage shows practical validation—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete, functional AI integration (Gemini 2.5 API) that produces substantive outputs (strategy assessment, winners/losers, risks) which update with user inputs—demonstrating value beyond superficial use. The student also reflects on appropriate AI use, supporting that the integration is thoughtful and effective.",
