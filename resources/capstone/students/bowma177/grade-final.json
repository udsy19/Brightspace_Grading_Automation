You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student shows a functioning financial application with concrete, demonstrable features (transaction logging, bill management, spending analysis, and what‑if tools) and live data updates, satisfying the criterion. Implementation and reflect evidence confirm the app is operational and purposefully designed for financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a functioning AI component that uses real user data to provide contextual financial feedback (implementation evidence) and the student reflects on making the AI non-generic and improving it (reflection evidence). This demonstrates effective AI integration that adds value to the tool, meeting PASS criteria.",
