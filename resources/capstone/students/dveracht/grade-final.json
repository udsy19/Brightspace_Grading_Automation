  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it accepts financial and deal inputs, runs scenario/valuation analyses, and generates a one-page investment memo with risks, valuation ranges, and recommendations (Discover and Implement evidence). Reflection discusses limitations but does not undermine that the tool performs the required financial tasks, supporting a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration: structured inputs trigger an AI-generated one-page memo with substantive sections (executive summary, risks, diligence questions), and the student shows implementation flow and reflective awareness of limitations. This constitutes a thorough, functional integration beyond superficial use.",
