  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working application that ingests financial figures and returns domain-specific explanations (evidence: webhook → Gemini → explanation and the concrete example). Implementation and reflection quotes demonstrate an end-to-end, real-time system, meeting the criterion that the tool functions as a financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a concrete, working AI integration (technical architecture and API use) and shows it adds user-facing value via example explanations. Implementation details and reflection on reliability indicate more than superficial use, meeting the PASS standard.",

That data is then sent to Google's Gemini language model through an API call. The model is prompted to explain what changed, why it changed, and why it matters, specifically for a non-finance audience. The generated explanation is then returned instantly as the response.\"",
        "\"For example, in this test case, revenue increased while costs rose even faster due to hiring more staff. Instead of just showing margin compression numerically, the AI explains that growth required upfront investment in people, which may pressure short-term profitability but could support future scaling.\""
