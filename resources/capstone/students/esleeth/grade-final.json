  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that accepts financial inputs and produces usable investment memos, verified with multiple real scenarios (IMPLEMENT and DISCOVER). The reflections about reliability and end-to-end operation further confirm it functions as a practical financial app (REFLECT).\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete, working AI integration (OpenAI node used as the reasoning layer, dynamic injection of user inputs, live webhook endpoint) and shows that AI materially adds value by producing usable, scenario-adjusted memos. Implementation and testing evidence from the Implement and Reflect stages confirm integration is functional and not superficial.",
