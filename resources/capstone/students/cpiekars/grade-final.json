  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a functioning buy-vs-rent financial tool with detailed financial inputs, computed outputs (costs, mortgage/tax/maintenance breakdowns, graphs), and actionable recommendations, plus evidence of implementation via an AI API and interactive testing. These indicate a thorough, working financial application, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates a working AI integration that generates contextual recommendations (rent vs buy) and updates dynamically when inputs are changed, indicating the AI adds decision-making value. Discover and Implement evidence show intent and functional incorporation, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.",
