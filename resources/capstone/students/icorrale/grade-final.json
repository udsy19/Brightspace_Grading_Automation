  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial tool focused on stocks (multiple examples referenced) and shows implemented functionality that fetches and displays company-specific financial/contextual information. Discover and Implement stages confirm purpose and operational behavior, and Reflect shows user-perceived financial value, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, correct AI-like functionality conceptually (fetching content and producing plain-English company explanations and bull/bear analyses) and demonstrates value, but the student never explicitly describes AI integration or technical details. That indicates a correct but basic treatment of AI integration, so PARTIAL.",
