  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a functioning financial tool: concrete income and expense entries, aggregated totals, net profit and margin calculations, and dashboard breakdowns, supported by Discover/Implement/Reflect stages. This fulfills the criterion that the tool performs financial tasks and is therefore a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission explicitly positions the tool as AI-powered and applies it to a concrete financial task (Discover/Implement), and the student reflects that it adds value. However, the transcript lacks specific examples of AI functionality (e.g., automated predictions, NLP interactions, model-driven insights) or evidence that AI meaningfully enabled features beyond standard calculations, so the integration is correct but basic.",
