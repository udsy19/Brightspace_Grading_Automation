You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student implemented an AI financial planner that applies the future-value/annuity formula, returns concrete monthly savings (demonstrated by the $263 example), and explicitly validated the calculations across scenarios, meeting the criterion that the tool functions as a financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a substantive, working integration of AI (implemented interactive planner in ChatGPT that performs TVM calculations and produces tailored explanations) and demonstrates validation across examples. Implementation, testing, and reflection evidence indicate the AI adds clear functional value beyond a superficial use.",
