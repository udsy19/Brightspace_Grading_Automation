You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application with multiple concrete examples (salary EV calculation, rent vs. buy, loans, bids), automated logging, and an implemented JS layer and roleplay/analysis modes. The transcript shows both the motivation and working implementation plus resolved bugs, meeting the PASS standard for thorough, applied treatment.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective, substantive AI integration across multiple concrete examples (salary, rent vs buy, loans, bids), a structured AI output schema, runtime validation, and persistent logging—showing the AI adds real decision-making value. The demonstrated Discover and Implement stages plus reflection on improvements support a thorough, working integration rather than a superficial use.",
