  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student describes a working budget analyzer that accepts Excel/PDF inputs and produces summaries, risk flags, recommendations, and visualizations, and reports successful testing by a peer. Implement and Validate/Reflect evidence demonstrate the tool was built and functions as a financial application, meeting the pass criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly used AI assistance to generate code and source an API key and built a working budget analyzer that produced recommendations (Implement/Validate). However, the submission lacks detailed evidence of deep AI integration within the tool itself (e.g., how AI powers the analysis or examples of AI-driven outputs), so the integration is real and valuable but not demonstrated thoroughly enough for a full PASS.",
