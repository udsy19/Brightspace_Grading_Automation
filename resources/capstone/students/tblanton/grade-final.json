You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a functioning AI integration that adds clear value (automated, categorized uploads to a spreadsheet) and includes implementation details and iteration to correct model behavior. The evidence across Discover, Implement, and Reflect shows the AI is meaningfully integrated rather than superficial.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial tool that records and categorizes expenses (evidence: automated add and sheet entry), showing implementation and iteration. However, treatment is limited to a single demo and brief discussion of improvements and applications, so it shows correct functionality but not the comprehensive depth required for a full PASS.",
