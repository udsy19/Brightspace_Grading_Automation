  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a working financial application that analyzes a CFO statement, generates a quantitative risk score, and flags specific financial issues (inventory spike, cash burn, guidance removal), demonstrating functional financial-task performance. Implementation evidence (running the agent) plus reflective commentary supports that the tool operates as a substantive financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI (built an agent in Google AI Studio) and demonstrated it working on a real example, producing structured flags and a risk score that add actionable analytic value. Implementation and reflection quotes show the AI was designed intentionally to augment analysis, satisfying the criterion for effective AI integration.",
