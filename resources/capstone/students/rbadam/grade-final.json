  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: the tool is implemented and hosted, accepts inputs, computes cost-of-equity numbers, and provides finance-specific interpretation (SML position, volatility, implications for DCF). Discover and Implement evidence show both the intent and a functioning demonstration, meeting the criterion for a pass.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI (Gemini) into a working tool and demonstrated added value through quantitative outputs (cost-of-equity calculation) and qualitative insights (flagging anomalies, market behavior), addressing a discovered user need. This shows a substantive, applied AI integration beyond superficial use, meeting the PASS standard.",
