  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial application that accepts budget/actual inputs, performs variance analysis, and returns interpreted results (category-level explanations and overall summary). The implemented example and stated testing (Discover → Implement → Reflect) provide concrete evidence the tool functions as a financial application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student shows correct and valuable AI integration conceptually—the tool uses Gemini/Craya to analyze and explain variances for non-finance users—so it adds clear value (Discover/Implement/Reflect). However, the submission is high-level and lacks technical depth or multiple detailed examples of AI behavior or outputs, so it meets a partial rather than full PASS.",
