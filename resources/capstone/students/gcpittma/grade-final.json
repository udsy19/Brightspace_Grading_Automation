  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it extracts listing financial data, computes loan summaries, DTI, monthly payments, and investment rules (70% and 1% rules), and supports saving/comparing properties. The Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages show purposeful design, working features, and handling of real-world constraints, meeting the PASS threshold.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates automated scraping and rule-based investment calculations (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT) but contains no mention or evidence of AI models, learning, or intelligent inference. Because AI integration is neither described nor demonstrated, the criterion is not met.",
