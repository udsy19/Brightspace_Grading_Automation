  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that computes loan amount, monthly payment, and total interest across multiple test cases, fulfilling the functional requirement. The Discover and Implement stages show clear problem framing and executed calculations, while Reflect shows interpretation of results—together supporting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated an AI chat component to compute and explain mortgage scenarios (Implement evidence) and demonstrated multiple example runs that produce usable outputs. However, the integration is basic—focused on automating calculations/explanations without deeper AI design discussion, limitations, or added advanced capabilities—so it meets the criterion partially rather than thoroughly.",

So here it gives us the monthly rate payment is $3,838 with a total interest paid over the time of the loan which is 20 years will be $426,55.\"",
        "\"So, now we want to do one more...million home 10% down...Monthly payment would be $7,898...over the course of your loan you would pay a total interest of approximately a million 943 and 332,000.\""
