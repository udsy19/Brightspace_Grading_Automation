You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript contains multiple concrete demonstrations of financial functionality (real-time prices, market caps, historical charts, calculated metrics, and cross-stock comparisons), showing the tool performs financial tasks. Despite some implementation limits noted in reflection, the student implemented and demonstrated substantive, working financial features, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly intended and used AI to build the application (DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT), but the transcript lacks evidence of robust AI-driven runtime features or substantive AI-generated analysis beyond having the AI produce the app. The student's own reflection about incompleteness and tooling limits supports a partial (but not full) integration.",
