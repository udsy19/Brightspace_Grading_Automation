  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working investment application that generates portfolio recommendations, produces allocations and risk analysis for multiple user profiles, and performs historical backtests using market data via APIs. Implementation details and multiple example outputs show thorough, functional treatment of the financial-application criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive, non-superficial AI integration: model selection and prompt design, programmatic connection of live/backtest data via APIs, and AI-generated personalized outputs with explanations and historical performance. These concrete implementations and the student's reflection demonstrate a thorough, value-adding integration consistent with a PASS.",
