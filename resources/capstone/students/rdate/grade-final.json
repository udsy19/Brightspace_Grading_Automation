  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built a functioning financial application (mortgage calculator) that accepts parameters, computes loan amount, payments, total interest, and inflation-adjusted costs, and demonstrates results with concrete examples. Implement and Discover evidence show practical operation and inputs/outputs; Reflect confirms the student’s validation and application of the tool.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student asserts the project is an AI tool and demonstrates implemented features (Discover + Implement) and reflective synthesis, but provides no concrete detail about what AI techniques or models are used or how AI adds capabilities beyond deterministic calculation. That indicates correct intent and basic integration but lacks the depth and evidence required for a full PASS.",

Um, the total interest, which comes out to $459,000. And the real monthly cost, um, that's the value in 30 years adjusted for inflation, which is $1,300, $1,362.\""
