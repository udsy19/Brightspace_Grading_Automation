  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built a functioning financial tool that ingests property inputs and returns financial metrics (cash flow, cap rate, cash-on-cash, break-even), and described implementation/debugging of the workflow. Evidence from Discover and Implement stages shows the tool operates as a financial application and is used to analyze properties, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete AI integration (AI-generated workflow, iterative debugging of AI outputs) and shows that it materially speeds and automates property cash-flow analysis. Evidence from Implement and Reflect stages indicates the AI component adds practical value rather than being superficial.",
