  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: an AI agent that parses contracts, extracts variables, reconstructs cash flows, computes effective APRs, and outputs verdicts (shown with both a predatory example and a standard loan). Iterative implementation and reflection evidence (Implement and Reflect stages) support that the tool performs substantive financial tasks reliably enough to pass.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates an active, substantive AI integration: a deployed agent that ingests contracts, extracts variables, computes effective APRs, and flags risks (supported by concrete examples and outputs). The student also iteratively improved the system and reflected on prompt engineering and verification, showing effective and meaningful use of AI beyond a superficial mention.",
