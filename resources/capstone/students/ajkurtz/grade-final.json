You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a functioning financial application: user inputs (income, contributions, savings, risk, accounts) and the app returns concrete portfolio allocations, projections, contribution strategy, and advice. Multiple implemented features and example scenarios demonstrate substantive financial functionality, satisfying PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows an AI component explicitly integrated and producing concrete, value-adding outputs (asset allocation, specific recommendations, explanatory context), supported by the Implement stage. Discover and Reflect comments further confirm purposeful AI use and its perceived usefulness, meeting the PASS standard.",
