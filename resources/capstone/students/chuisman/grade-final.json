  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a functioning financial application: it uses finance APIs (Alpha Vantage, insider transactions), runs agent analyses on stock volume/news/insider activity, and produced specific findings (Carvana check and Beyond Meat insider dumps). Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages collectively show practical financial functionality rather than just a conceptual idea.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates an AI-agent architecture conceptually and provides demo examples (Carvana, Beyond Meat) showing the agents producing actionable findings, so AI adds value. However, technical details of the AI integration (models, decision logic, or how agents coordinate) are limited and reliance on a finance API is emphasized, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
