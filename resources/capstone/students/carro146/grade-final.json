  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working workflow that accepts revenue/expense inputs, calls an AI model via API, computes percentage changes and explanations, and updates interactively—demonstrating a functioning financial application (Discover + Implement). The Reflect stage confirms validation and useful outcomes, supporting a PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates effective, non-superficial AI integration: they call the OpenAI API with a structured prompt, drive dynamic outputs (plain-English explanations, percent changes, follow-up questions) based on inputs, and explicitly state the AI reasoning is not hardcoded. Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence together show a strong, functional integration that adds clear user value.",
