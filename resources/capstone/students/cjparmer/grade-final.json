  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that computes material, crew, overhead, and profit with concrete examples and a final project cost, satisfying the criterion. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence show intent and functioning calculations, while REFLECT confirms testing and awareness of limitations.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes a Colab script that performs formulaic cost calculations but contains no evidence of AI methods, models, or AI-driven features; the DRIVER stages show planning, building, and reflecting on a non-AI script. Therefore the criterion \"Integrate AI\" is not met.",
