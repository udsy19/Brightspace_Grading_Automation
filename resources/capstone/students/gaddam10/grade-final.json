  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application that computes NPV and IRR, compares IRR to WACC, produces recommendations, visualizations, scenario comparisons, and an AI executive memo. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows both functionality and applied financial reasoning, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates an AI-generated executive memo that adds communicative value and is demonstrated in the implementation, so integration is real and beneficial. However, the discussion of AI is limited to a single memo feature and lacks deeper detail or multiple AI applications, so it meets the criterion partially rather than thoroughly.",

      "driver_alignment": "The DISCOVER stage provided the tool purpose and target users; the IMPLEMENT stage showed interactive functionality (inputs, \"analyze project\", automated NPV/IRR calculation); the REFLECT stage confirmed conceptual integration and practical usefulness (shortcut for calculating NPV, scenario comparison, visualizations, AI memo).",
