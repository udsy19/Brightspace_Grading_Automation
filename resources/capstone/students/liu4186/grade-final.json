  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a concrete, implemented tool that ingests Fed text and produces structured trading signals and asset views, with example outputs and conservative confidence handling (Implement and Represent stages). The project also validates alignment with market commentary and emphasizes responsible interpretation (Discover and Reflect), meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission provides concrete, specific examples of AI-driven functionality (implementation platform, auto-classification, structured AI outputs) and describes validation and responsible design decisions, demonstrating thorough and effective AI integration rather than a superficial mention. The Implement and Reflect stages particularly support that the AI adds functional value.",

        "\"In the Trading Signals panel, the tool maps the speech into asset views and correctly stays Neutral across 2Y yields, 10Y yields, curve (2s10s), USD (DXY), equities, credit spreads, and gold—each with very low confidence.\""
