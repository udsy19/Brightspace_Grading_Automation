  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student built and executed a working Python tool that generates financial snapshots and full investment memos for companies (Implement evidence), chosen to address a specific problem (Discover) and validated results against real data (Reflect). These show the tool functions as a financial application, meeting the pass criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI is central to the tool (interactive memo generation) and was iteratively improved and validated against real data, demonstrating effective, value-adding integration. Although implementation details are light, the DRIVER stages provide sufficient conceptual and practical evidence to meet PASS under the moderate standard.",
