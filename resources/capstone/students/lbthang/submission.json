  "transcript": "0:02\nHi guys, my name is Law and for this\n0:05\nvideo um it is my capstone project.\n0:10\nUm in class we've been learning about\n0:13\ninvestment due diligence and one thing\n0:16\nis clear when\n0:19\nwe are analyzing a company or when you\n0:22\nare analyzing a company um digging\n0:25\nthrough the the fluff to find real risk\n0:29\nis a massive massive waste of time. Um\n0:33\nwhen\n0:35\nyou are analyzing a company, you need to\n0:38\nnote the risk immediately. But the 10K\n0:42\nreports um bury the critical uh\n0:45\nfinancial threats under thousands of\n0:49\ngeneric words. So I wanted to build a\n0:52\ntool that uh accelerates the analysis\n0:56\nthe analysis\n0:58\nletting you spot investment risk in the\n1:02\nin seconds and not hours of reading.\n1:06\nSo here on my screen we have my um\n1:11\nthe demo. I called it the red flag\n1:14\ndetector.\n1:16\nUm, I'm using Replet.\n1:19\nUh, so it uses AI to filter out the\n1:23\nstandard market noise and isolate\n1:26\nspecific threats to the company stock.\n1:30\nSo, let me show you how um this works.\n1:33\nSo, for example, for this video's\n1:36\nexample, I'm going to use Tesla's um\n1:39\nrisk factors to a standard analysis.\n1:42\nThis is just raw data that needs to be\n1:46\nprocessed. So, we're going to the actual\n1:49\nwebsite\n1:51\nin the form 10K\n1:54\nand we're going to risk factors\n1:58\nand we're just going to get all this.\n2:03\nYep.\n2:05\nAnd then copy it here.\n2:10\nSo analyze risk\n2:14\num it's going to take some times but\n2:19\nwhat it will do is it will calculate the\n2:22\nrisk score.\n2:26\nSo yeah,\n2:29\nso you\n2:31\nfeed that info into the model. It will\n2:35\nextract the key value,\n2:38\nthe value drivers and threads. So right\n2:41\nhere it calculates, it didn't take long.\n2:43\nIt calculated a risk score giving me a\n2:46\num quantitative metric for how d how\n2:49\ndangerous\n2:51\nuh this investment looks. So 90 out of\n2:54\n100\n2:56\nAnd here it identifies material risk\n3:01\nlike supply chain\n3:04\num concentration\n3:07\nregulation legatory bands that would\n3:11\nactually impact the P&L which is the\n3:14\nprofit and loss. Um it turns a\n3:18\nqualitative document into a quantitive\n3:20\ninsight\n3:22\nwith this tool.\n3:24\nSo\n3:27\nbuilding this taught me that the real\n3:30\nchallenge isn't just the code. It's\n3:35\nmaking the prompt and working messing\n3:37\nwith the prompt and working with it to\n3:39\nstop the AI u from giving generic safe\n3:44\nanswers.\n3:45\nNow that the\n3:47\nthe logic works for 10ks, the next step\n3:51\nis scaling this to analyze the live\n3:54\nearnings call transcripts in real time.\n3:59\nAnd that is\n4:02it for my um my video. Thank you."
