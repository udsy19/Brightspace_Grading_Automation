You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application that processes 10‑K risk text, isolates threats, and outputs a quantitative risk score (evidence from Implement and Discover). Reflection on prompt tuning and scaling further supports that this is a functioning financial tool rather than a hypothetical description.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration that transforms qualitative 10‑K text into quantitative risk scores and extracted threats (Implement + Discover). The student also demonstrates awareness of non‑trivial prompt tuning and limitations (Reflect), indicating substantive, non‑superficial use of AI—meeting the PASS standard.",
