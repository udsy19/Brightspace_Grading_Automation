You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial tool that accepts budgeted and actual figures, computes and visualizes variances, and generates executive explanations for non-financial users. Implementation and testing evidence (Google AI Studio prompts and scenario tests) show the app functions as a financial application, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI use (Google AI Studio) producing interactive outputs (visualizations and executive summaries) that add clear user value, and documents iterative prompt refinement and testing. These specifics across Discover/Implement/Reflect demonstrate effective AI integration beyond a superficial mention, so it passes.",
