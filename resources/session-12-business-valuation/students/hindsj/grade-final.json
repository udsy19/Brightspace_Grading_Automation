  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year forecast (explicit period) and an exit/terminal treatment (year‑5 multiples and a stated terminal growth), and shows awareness of the WACC > terminal growth requirement. Scenario descriptions (upside with more stores/digital mix, downside) indicate reasonable higher short-term vs lower long-term assumptions; overall the treatment is conceptually thorough for this moderate rubric.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Starbucks, Chipotle) and described applying comparable multiples to projected year‑five earnings using code, demonstrating correct methodology. The DRIVER stages (Discover and Implement, with Reflect acknowledging method choices) show an applied, coherent approach meeting an introductory comparable‑methodology standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly triangulated valuation by using a DCF and applying comparable/precedent multiples to a year‑five exit, presented scenario valuations (downside/base/upside) and sensitivity discussion, and gave a justified bid range (9–13B) tied to buyer economics and synergies. This is a thorough, reasoned treatment meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes DCF as valuing cash flow today and explicitly uses a WACC (9%) and terminal growth consideration, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic—no clear derivation or explicit discounting of projected free cash flows (they rely on year‑five earnings and exit multiples), so the coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual understanding of cash‑flow valuation (use of DCF, WACC, and EV/EBITDA) and modeling via the DRIVER stages, but does not explicitly identify core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. This partial coverage merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates inclusion of terminal value by both a Gordon growth assumption (2.5% g with WACC discussion) and applying exit multiples to year‑5 earnings, showing practical implementation (Implement) and reflection on model choice. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF's value, so coverage is correct but incomplete, yielding a PARTIAL.",
