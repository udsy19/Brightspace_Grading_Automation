  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year forecast period from a terminal period and provides multiple short-term growth scenarios (base 8%, bull 12%, bear 4%) with a lower terminal growth (3%), demonstrating appropriate multi-stage growth reasoning. They also implemented these assumptions in a DCF script and used the scenario outputs to inform valuation and strategy, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions), reports numeric results for each, and explicitly provides a triangulated range (11.5–13.5bn) plus a bid/walk-away recommendation. The work shows methodological implementation and reflective judgment about which values are reasonable, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission explicitly includes projections (5‑year growth scenarios), a terminal growth assumption, a discount rate, and mention of discounted cash flows, and it reports a specific enterprise value (12.5B) plus sensitivity cases. These elements demonstrate a complete DCF model structure consistent with the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies a DCF workflow (running discounted cash flows, scenario growth rates, and a specified 9% discount rate) but provides only brief, high-level treatment without explicitly defining DCF as the present value of future free cash flows or discussing WACC/details of the discounting mechanics. This demonstrates correct conceptual use but not the depth required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performed a DCF and reported valuations and inputs but did not identify Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to providers of capital. Evidence shows high-level DCF use without the required component-level discussion, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly specifies a terminal growth rate (3%) and applies multiples (900 * 12/15), showing both growth- and multiple-style terminal approaches. However, treatment is brief and there is no explicit discussion that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
