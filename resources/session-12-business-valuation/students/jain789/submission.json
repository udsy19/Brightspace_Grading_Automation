  "transcript": "Hi everyone. This is session 12\n0:02\nassignment and the main question we're\n0:04\ntrying to help um answer is what is the\n0:07\nmaximum price KKR can offer for Panera\n0:10\nBread to win the deal against strategic\n0:12\nbuyers like McDonald's while still\n0:14\nmaking a profit.\n0:16\nSo what is our um objective? We're going\n0:19\nto determine a winning bid range for KKR\n0:22\nto acquire Panera Bread while ensuring\n0:24\nan acceptable IRR. Some key constraints\n0:27\nand inputs are our target for Panera\n0:30\nBread is 6 billion revenue, 900 million\n0:32\nIBITA, 400 million net income. Our\n0:35\ngrowth is 8% base case, um 9% discount\n0:39\nrate, and the conflict is KKR versus\n0:43\nStarbucks/M.\n0:46\nSo, what we're going to do is we're\n0:47\ngoing to ask Gemini to create a um\n0:49\nscript for us to handle a DCF and\n0:52\ncompareable\n0:53\nanalysis. So, what we're going to do is\n0:56\nwe're going to take the script and we're\n0:58\ngoing to do the collab.\n1:00\nUm, and we're going to run our script.\n1:04\nAnd as you can see, it works like we're\n1:07\ngoing to see the numbers that we're just\n1:08\ntalking about. Current um revenue 6,000\n1:12\nwhich is 6.8 million, 15% margins, net\n1:15\nincome is 400 million, 9% capital rate.\n1:18\nSo, scenarios for 5 years is our growth\n1:20\nbase is 8%.\n1:23\num terminal growth is 3%. Part two is\n1:26\ncalculating the EV. So, we're going to\n1:28\ntake 900 * 12, 900 * 15. We're going to\n1:31\ntake our discounted cash flow and we're\n1:34\njust going to run through some scenarios\n1:36\nand we're going to go back and we're\n1:38\ngoing to do some analysis\n1:40\nbased on the Python logic above. This is\n1:42\nthe triangulation of value. The\n1:45\nprecedent um transaction is about 10.8\n1:48\nbillion to 13.5. This is the most\n1:51\nreliable metric for buyout. Our trading\n1:54\ncomp is 8.8 billion to 12 billion load\n1:56\nand ed EDA method. In our DCF, our\n1:59\nintrinsic value is 12.5 billion for base\n2:02\ncase 8% growth. Bull case 12% growth is\n2:05\nuh 14.8 billion and bare case 4% growth\n2:08\nis 10.6 billion. The triangulated value\n2:10\nrange is 11.5 to 13.5 billion.\n2:15\nSo as a financial buyer, this is the KKR\n2:18\nperspective. The goal is to buy at 12\n2:20\nbillion, exit at 20 billion in 5 years.\n2:23\nThere's no constraints, no synergies,\n2:25\nbut we must rely on operational\n2:26\ndiscipline. The trap is KKR plays a\n2:29\nstrategic price, their returns will be\n2:32\ndestroyed because they cannot supply\n2:34\nchain cost the way Starbucks can. So the\n2:36\nlever, the management rollover,\n2:38\nconvincing manager to keep 10% of equity\n2:40\nlowers the cash KKR needs up front. Now\n2:42\non the strategic buyer um perspective of\n2:45\nStarbucks and McDonald's. Their goal is\n2:47\nto acquire Panera's digital platform and\n2:49\nlocations. Their advantage is their\n2:51\nsynergies as a they can remove Panera's\n2:54\nheadquarters, merge chains, and\n2:56\ncross-ell. And the implication is they\n2:58\ncan afford to pay $14 billion and still\n3:00\nmake the numbers work because they're\n3:01\njust that big. So let's go to our\n3:03\nreflect. What is our recommendation to\n3:05\nKKR the investment committee from the\n3:08\ndeal team subject Panera acquisition\n3:10\nstrategy? The valuation assessment we\n3:13\nvalue paneer bread at 12.5 billion case\n3:16\nbase base case based on the discounted\n3:18\ncash flow fundamentals and 13.8% EB\n3:22\nmultiple the bid recommendation is 11.5\n3:25\nbillion to open this anchor negotiation\n3:28\nthe walk away what we're going to walk\n3:29\naway from and absolute max is 13.5 13.0\n3:33\nNo billion, excuse me. Uh, winning\n3:36\nstrategy, which is what we're going to\n3:37\ncall the alpha. Since we cannot beat\n3:39\nstrategic buyers on price, we must win\n3:41\non structure and speed. Lean heavily on\n3:44\na 10% rollover. Position KKR as a\n3:46\npartner that will current management\n3:48\nstay in control. We're going to\n3:50\nunderwrite the bull case to stretch our\n3:52\nvaluation model. And we're going to\n3:53\npropose um keeping the digital arm\n3:56\nindependent or licensing it to increase\n3:58\nthe exit valuation multiple steps later.\n4:01\nAnd yeah, that is our um recommendations\n4:03and our analysis for this session."
