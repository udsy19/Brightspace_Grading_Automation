  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly cites an industry WACC (~9%), implements a DCF that computes PV of cash flows and terminal value, and runs sensitivity analysis across WACC assumptions. This shows both use of WACC as the discount rate for FCFF and use of a defensible (industry) WACC, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compared multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedents), reported specific numeric outcomes for each, ran sensitivity analysis (WACC vs terminal growth), and recommended a justified bid range distinguishing financial vs. strategic buyers. Coverage is detailed and applied across DRIVER stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission explicitly defines DCF components (projections via EBITDA start/growth, PV of cash flows, and terminal value), cites a WACC assumption, performs sensitivity, and reports specific enterprise value numbers across scenarios—meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as an intrinsic valuation method and implements a DCF function that returns PV components, and explicitly references WACC. However the treatment is brief and lacks deeper explanatory detail or multiple worked examples, so it meets a correct but basic (PARTIAL) level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of DCF/enterprise-value (cash-flow based valuation) and links cash flows to buyer strategies, but does not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor show conversion from EBITDA to unlevered free cash flow. This shows understanding but incomplete coverage, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly implements a terminal value in the DCF (PV terminal), so the calculation element is present. However, the student does not explicitly state that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of enterprise value; they only show sensitivity to terminal growth/WACC. Thus the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",
