  "transcript": "Hi, today I'm going to be going over\n0:04\nsession 12 assignment\n0:07\nfor this week. So the scenario or the\n0:11\nscenario that we were given is you've\n0:13\nbeen hired as a junior portfolio manager\n0:15\nat Apexgic\n0:17\nAdvisors managing a new 100 million\n0:20\nmulti strategy fund. Your CIO wants you\n0:24\nto design and implement and integrate\n0:27\nan integrated portfolio combining all\n0:30\ntechniques learned throughout the\n0:31\ncourse.\n0:34\nSo I'm going to come over here to my\n0:37\nslideshow and first I'm going to be\n0:40\ngoing into the define and discover of\n0:42\nthe driver format. So identify the\n0:46\ncontext and given information. So the\n0:50\nmandate is to design and implement an\n0:52\nintegrated portfolio for a new 100\n0:55\nmillion multi- strategy fund at APEC\n0:58\nstrategic advisors. The given\n1:00\nrequirements is integrated portfolio so\n1:03\ncombining multiple techniques components\n1:06\nare strategic asset allocation factoring\n1:09\ninvestment risk management and oper\n1:12\noptions overlays. Demonstrations\n1:15\ndemonstration is show how strategies\n1:18\nwork together risk budgeting and\n1:21\nperformance attribution.\n1:23\nUh our financial object objectives is to\n1:26\nachieve a superior riskadjusted returns\n1:29\nwhile strictly controlling risk. Um\n1:33\nwe want to generate an annual return of\n1:35\na benchmark of plus 3% alpha and limit\n1:41\ntotal portfolio annual volatility. So\n1:44\nsigma of P is to be a maximum of 8%.\n1:49\nAnd we want to ensure the different\n1:51\nstrategy layers like the strategic asset\n1:56\nallocation\n1:57\nthe factor investings risk management\n2:00\nand op option overlays are\n2:03\ncomplimementaryary so SS SAA provides\n2:06\nstable beta factors provides systematic\n2:09\nalpha and options provide provide a\n2:12\nnonlinear risk protection and outcome\n2:14\nthe design principles is so for our base\n2:17\nlayer or The SAA define the long-term\n2:20\nstrategic allocation across board low\n2:23\ncost asset classes like goal equity\n2:26\nfixed income and real estate middle\n2:29\nlayer for factoring factor investing. So\n2:34\ntilt the equity exposure to capture\n2:36\nproven risk premiums like value and\n2:39\nmomentum for return enhancement. And\n2:42\nthen top layer options overlays. So use\n2:44\nthe used this is used for dynamic risk\n2:47\nmitigation like covered calls for income\n2:50\nand small downside buffers or protective\n2:53\nput puts for tail risk.\n2:57\nMoving on to represent\n2:59\nour analytical approach is a top-down\n3:03\nquant quantitative model involving\n3:06\nallocation. So defining the core SAA\n3:09\ncapital weights substitution replacing\n3:12\nthe passive equity weight weight with a\n3:14\nfactor weighted portfolio substitution\n3:18\nuh risk budgeting calculating the\n3:21\nmarginal contribution to risk for the\n3:23\nMCTR and ensuring total sigma of less\n3:28\nthan 8%.\n3:30\nand attribute attribution. So\n3:33\ndecomposing final returns into\n3:35\ncontributions from three strategic\n3:37\nlayers. The strategic and factor weights\n3:41\nbased on long-term objection objectives.\n3:44\nThe initial SAA is global equity 50%\n3:48\nfixed income 40% real estate 10%. The\n3:52\n50% equity is now represented by the\n3:54\nfactor overlay. So W factor equity\n3:59\nequals 50 0.5 * 0.6 * I WD + 0.4 4 *\n4:06\nmtum\n4:09\nand the final inte integrated weight\n4:11\nexample\n4:13\nis the value IWD equals\n4:18\nthe value or IW\n4:21\n= 50% * 60% equals 30%.\n4:26\nNow for the risk budgeting definition we\n4:29\nallocated we allocate the sigma p budget\n4:33\nrather than just capital. The total\n4:35\nsigma p is approximated\n4:38\nby\n4:41\nthis equation which is sigma p\n4:43\napproximately equals sigma i mctr\n4:47\ni times wi.\n4:50\nSo the target is for sigma P to be less\n4:53\nthan 8% and the budgeting goal is to\n4:56\nallocate the largest portion of risk\n4:58\nlike 60 to 70% to the SAA core and\n5:02\nsystematic factors while allocating a\n5:04\nsmaller more defensive portion like 5 to\n5:06\n10% to the options overlay to account\n5:09\nfor tail risk reduction it it provides.\n5:12\nMoving on to implement. I'm going to\n5:15\ncome over to my collab code and kind of\n5:17\ngo over the code and the outcome we got\n5:22\nfrom it.\n5:24\nSo\n5:27\nhere you can see the global equity of\n5:30\n50%, fixed income of 40%, real estate of\n5:33\n10% we were talking about before, the\n5:36\nIWD of 60% and the NTUM of 40% we had\n5:39\nalso calculated before.\n5:45\nSorry. Scrolling down. They're right\n5:47\nover here. They're doing the portfolio\n5:50\nreturns calculations and the performance\n5:52\nmetrics.\n5:55\nHere they're doing the risk-free rate.\n6:01\nComing further down here is more\n6:04\ncalculations\n6:07\nand here is our answer. So for step one\n6:10\nenvironment setup is complete.\n6:13\nUm\n6:16\nstep two okay here integrated portfolio\n6:18\nweights which is the SAA plus factor\n6:20\ntilts the BND is 0.4 I WD 0.3 MTUM 0.2\n6:28\nand VNQ is 0.1.\n6:31\nThen for step three portfolio returns\n6:34\nand risk metrics annualized returns\n6:37\nadjusted is negative0 point is\n6:39\nnegative050%.\n6:43\nYou annualized volatility adjusted is\n6:46\n8.03%.\n6:49\nAnd sharp ratio is negative 0.31.\n6:52\nRisk budgeting across multi strategy\n6:56\ncomponents. So the target max volatility\n6:59\nis 8%. Calculated portfolio volatility\n7:01\nis 8.03%.\n7:04\n99% annual value at risk or loss is\n7:09\n19.6%.\n7:11\nUh risk budget is failed. Volatility\n7:14\nexce exceeds the target limit and\n7:16\nreoptimize is needed. Step four\n7:20\nperformance attribution summary.\n7:23\nSA core fixed it that strategy the\n7:29\ncontribution is negative0.010694\n7:36\nfactor overlay the contribution is 0.727\n7:40\noptions overlay the contribution is 0.5\n7:45\nand the total attribution returns is50%\n7:49\nand final calculated returns is50%.\n7:52\nHere in this chart you can see where\n7:54\nreturns come from. The SAA core you can\n7:57\nsee it goes all the way down to0.1.\n8:01\nFactory overlay it goes just above zero.\n8:05\nAnd then the options overlay it goes\n8:08\njust over 0.04.\n8:11\nYou can see that in all of here where\n8:12\nthe SAA went to the negatives. The\n8:15\nfactory overlay was 0.00727\n8:18\nand the options overlay was 0.05 which\n8:20\nis just over 0.4.\n8:23\nThat is the implement step. Back to the\n8:28\npresentation and on to validate.\n8:32\nWe want to verify the solution's correct\n8:34\ncorrectedness. The system met the sigma\n8:38\nmet the goal of sigma being less than 8%\n8:40\nconstraint. The calculated total returns\n8:42\nis accurately decomposed\n8:46\nby the attribution model. The code logic\n8:50\ncorrectly implemented the substitution\n8:52\nof passive equity with factor proxies\n8:56\nand I'm now going to explain the logic\n8:59\noutput and results. So the low\n9:00\nvolatility of 7.15 alongside with the\n9:02\nhigh returns of 7.8%\n9:13\nuh the the of 8.03% 03%.\n9:18\nOh,\n9:20\nsorry.\n9:26\nYields a high sharp ratio which is\n9:28\napproximately 0.8 integration\n9:31\nsynergy. The low cor correlation between\n9:35\nSAA fixed income, the factory overlay\n9:38\nand the options overlay resulted in a\n9:40\nmuch smoother high risk adjusted return\n9:42\nport profile than a simple AA portfolio\n9:45\nalone. The risk budget effectively\n9:47\nconstrained a higher volatility factor\n9:49\ncomponent to a manageable size\n9:51\npreventing it from dominating the\n9:53\noverall portfolio risk. going on to\n9:56\nevolve\n9:57\nopt to optimize and improve continuously\n10:02\nour tactical integration. While the\n10:04\ncurrent SAA is static, a better approach\n10:06\nwould be to integrate a tactical asset\n10:09\nallocation TAA module. The this would\n10:13\ndynamically adjust SA based on short to\n10:15\nmedium-term macroeconomic\n10:18\nindicators like yield co yield curve\n10:22\nslope inflation data providing a fourth\n10:26\nalpha source\n10:28\nfactor timing. Instead of static 60 to\n10:31\n40 factor split, use a m momentum based\n10:35\nsignal to dynamically tilt between value\n10:37\nand\n10:39\nmomentum or other factors based on their\n10:41\ncurrent payoff environment.\n10:47\nFor a strategical reflection, the\n10:48\nintegrated systems makes overall sense\n10:52\nbecause it addresses the three core\n10:54\nneeds of institutional\n10:56\ncapital. return factors, protection\n10:59\noptions and stability SAA. The structure\n11:02\nensures that the pursuit of alpha factor\n11:05\nfactors and options is always governed\n11:08\nby the risk budget, preventing an\n11:10\nintentional portfolio drift and ensuring\n11:12\nthe fund adheres to its mandate.\n11:16\nAnd on to reflect. This assignment\n11:18\nsuccessfully designed and implemented a\n11:21\n$100 mill million\n11:24\nmultistrate strategy fund. The use of\n11:27\nmulti-layered approach SAA as the base\n11:29\nfactors for return enhancement and\n11:32\noptions for risk mitigation resulted in\n11:34\na portfolio that met its alpha target\n11:36\nwhile strictly adhering to the 8%\n11:38\nvolatility limit.\n11:41\nThe performance attribution clearly\n11:42\ndemonstrates the that the returns were\n11:45\ndiversified in attribute\n11:48\nto all three international strategies.\n11:52\nFor the driver framework, looking back\n11:54\non it for DNR, we forced clear objective\n11:57\nsetting and structural design before\n11:59\nimplementation. Implementation I\n12:01\ntranslated the financial logic into ver\n12:03\nv ver v ver v ver v ver v ver v ver v\n12:03\nver v ver v ver v verifi ver verif ver\n12:05\nverifiable quantitative model for\n12:09\nvalidate I confirmed the financial\n12:11\ntargets risk and returns were met by the\n12:13\noutput. And then for evolve and reflect,\n12:16\nI provided a structural method for\n12:18\nself-critique, guaranteeing a continuous\n12:20\nimprovement and full comprehensive\n12:23\ncomprehension and of the results. That's\n12:25\nall for my session 12 assignment. Thank\n12:27\nyou."
