  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's), cited specific multiples (PE and EV/EBITDA ranges), and applied them to generate trading and precedent valuation ranges, including discussion of inconsistencies versus DCF. The treatment is concrete, supported by multiple examples and computed ranges, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly ran and compared at least three valuation methods, reported numeric ranges for each, discussed discrepancies (e.g., DCF vs. comps/precedent) and provided a reasoned base case and downside sensitivity. This demonstrates a thorough triangulation and sensitivity discussion consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly produced five‑year projections and implemented scenario/sensitivity logic (growth %, store additions, recession down‑case) so revenue and EBITDA evolve rather than remain static. The REPRESENT→IMPLEMENT→VALIDATE/EVOLVE chain shows a coherent, applied projection logic meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF, calculates unlevered free cash flows, and cites a discount-rate assumption (~9% WACC), showing conceptual grasp. However, they do not demonstrate detailed treatment of discounting mechanics or explicitly state discounting future FCFs to present value step-by-step, so the coverage is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements unlevered free cash flow conceptually (conversion of net income/interest to an unlevered cash flow and coding it), showing understanding of the FCF role in a driver-based DCF. However, they do not explicitly enumerate or discuss key FCF components (depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor explicitly state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so coverage is incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performs a 5-year DCF and uses multiples/comps, but never shows an explicit terminal value calculation (growth or exit multiple) nor discusses that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of enterprise value. Despite Implement and Reflect evidence of valuation work, the specific Terminal Value concept and its importance are missing, so the criterion is not met.",
