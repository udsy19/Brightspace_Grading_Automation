  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly projects free cash flows and terminal value, applies discounting, and conducts WACC sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a correct and comprehensive introductory DCF treatment. The Represent/Implement/Reflect stages provide detailed planning, actual outputs, and reflection on WACC impacts, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly included EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation/D&A, CapEx, and working capital in the model inputs and projected FCF in the DCF. They then used enterprise value and subtracted net debt to derive equity, demonstrating the concept that FCF-driven EV reflects cash available to all capital providers. The treatment is applied across scenarios and sensitivities, showing thorough, practical understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly built and ran terminal value calculations by both growth and multiple methods and reported the resulting EVs, meeting the first requirement. They also acknowledged the outsized impact of terminal growth/WACC on DCF results and used sensitivity/range analysis, demonstrating awareness of TV's dominant influence. This treatment is thorough and conceptually complete, so it merits a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed sanity checks by comparing DCF results to trading comps and precedent transactions and by checking growth assumptions against operational drivers, showing understanding of external validation. However, they did not name specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, SEC filings), so the validation is descriptive rather than explicitly sourced, warranting a PARTIAL.",
