  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs an unlevered free-cash-flow DCF and documents the cash‑flow build-up, and they state using a 9% WACC to derive enterprise value with sensitivity analysis. These details show a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF mechanics and discounting, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly documents the FCF build (EBITDA → EBIT → NOPAT → FCF after capex and working capital), which implies treatment of depreciation via the EBITDA→EBIT step. Using unlevered FCF discounted by WACC to arrive at enterprise value demonstrates understanding that these cash flows represent value available to all capital providers.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates an explicit five-year forecast from a terminal period and uses reasonable, differentiated growth assumptions (higher near-term 8% vs conservative 2.5% terminal). Scenario analysis, synergy ramping, and sensitivity tests demonstrate thoughtful multi-stage growth treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly includes a terminal value calculated via a terminal growth rate and parameterizes terminal assumptions, with sensitivity testing showing awareness of its influence. However, it does not explicitly state that terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF’s value, so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes enterprise value and discusses bid prices, but the transcript contains no explicit subtraction of Net Debt (or Debt less Cash) to derive Equity Value nor any division by share count to produce a Price Per Share. Therefore the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses WACC to discount unlevered free cash flows and explicitly applies a 9% WACC in the DCF, with sensitivity testing demonstrating awareness of its impact. However, they do not show a defensible derivation or benchmarking (e.g., calculated beta, capital structure, or industry-average justification), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
