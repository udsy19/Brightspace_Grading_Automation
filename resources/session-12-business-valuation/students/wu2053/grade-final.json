  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models standard free-cash-flow DCFs across scenarios and applies specific WACC discount rates and terminal growth rates to compute EVs, and they perform PV/terminal sanity checks. This demonstrates a thorough introductory grasp of DCF methodology and correct use of discounting.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations (growth-method inputs: WACC and g across scenarios) and explicitly quantifies that terminal value comprises the majority of EV (71–81%) with a sector sanity check. This is a thorough, well-supported treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly distinguishes a five-year explicit forecast period and a terminal period, models three scenario cases, and assigns sensible terminal growth rates (2–3%) lower than implied short-term operational improvements. Scenario-specific WACC/G pairs and FCF progression support a coherent multi-stage growth approach, meeting the thoroughness standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used free cash flow in a DCF, produced multi-year FCF forecasts, and tied FCF to EV (IMPLEMENT/REFLECT), showing conceptual understanding. However they did not identify or explain FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor explicitly state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates the correct conceptual bridge (used net debt and share count to move from EV to equity/share) but only at a high level with placeholder inputs and no explicit subtraction/division steps or supporting calculations shown. This is a correct but basic treatment, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied WACC as the discount rate to FCFF across downside/base/upside DCFs and reported specific WACC values (10%, 9%, 8.5%), satisfying correct application. However, they did not provide a calculated WACC or a detailed, defensible rationale (e.g., beta, capital structure, market premium or an explicit industry-average source), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
