  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and applies a DCF model, produces enterprise value outputs, and runs a sensitivity on the discount rate (referred to as \"walk\" at 9–10%), demonstrating correct conceptual use of discounting future projections. While wording is informal, the application and sensitivity analysis show a solid introductory grasp of DCF and use of WACC.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, Wendy's) and applied EV/EBITDA and precedent transaction multiples with explicit ranges and implied valuation outputs (12.6–15.3B, $1.4B synergy value). The use of trading comps/precedents in Validate and applied-synergy calculations in Evolve demonstrate a thorough, applied comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares DCF results to trading comps and precedents, runs sensitivity analysis showing value sensitivity to key drivers, and synthesizes a valuation range (≈$12.6–15.3B market band; 13–14B overlap) with a recommended bid. Coverage is specific and comprehensive, meeting the criterion for thorough triangulation and sensitivity.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates partial understanding by reporting EBITDA and net income and by implementing a DCF to produce enterprise value, indicating awareness of valuation cash-flow mechanics. However they do not explicitly identify or use the full FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation vs. CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission uses a DCF and market multiples for triangulation but contains no explicit terminal value calculation (growth or terminal multiple) nor any statement acknowledging that terminal value typically represents the majority of DCF value. Given the absence of explicit TV treatment or comment on its dominance, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models a multi-stage (multi-year) forecast with base/upside/downside growth assumptions and links short-term growth to margin changes, showing reasonable short-term rate differentiation. However, they do not explicitly state a terminal-period growth rate or a clear transition to a lower long-term growth rate, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
