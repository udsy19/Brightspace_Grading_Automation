  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, my name is kulpreet and today we'll\n0:04\nbe doing an evaluation of the Panera\n0:07\nbread for a potential takeover by KKR.\n0:11\nFollowing the driver framework, I will\n0:15\nbegin by defining the problem and\n0:17\ndiscovering our key data constraints.\n0:21\nSo today for our define stage our\n0:24\nobjective is to calculate the defensible\n0:28\nbid range for Panera.\n0:30\nWe are acting as KKR a financial buyer\n0:34\nwhich means we must balance aggressive\n0:37\ngrowth assumptions against strict return\n0:40\nthresholds which anticipating\n0:43\ncompetition from strategic buyers like\n0:46\nuh Starbucks and McDonald's.\n0:50\nSo here's how our data landscape we are\n0:53\nworking with. So the financials um\n0:56\nPanera\n0:58\ngenerates 900 million in IBITA with a\n1:02\n15% margin and has a strong digital\n1:06\nsales mix of 50%.\n1:08\nUm the industry trades at a 22xP.\n1:15\nuh high growth peers like Chipotle trade\n1:17\nat 35x while mature peers like\n1:20\nMcDonald's are at 25x.\n1:24\nUm we assume that 9% of the whack and\n1:28\nthe restaurant for 10% management\n1:31\nrollover\n1:32\nand uh the thesis relies on an opening\n1:35\nof 500 new stores and expanding the\n1:38\ndigital mix to 70%.\n1:40\nSo now that we have defined our\n1:42\nparameters, let's move on to the\n1:43\nrepresentation phase.\n1:46\nSo in our code\n1:48\nin the represent uh represent phase I've\n1:51\nmapped out our analytical approach.\n1:55\nSo um\n1:58\nthe DCF model um I will use a multi\n2:02\nscenario discount and cash flow analysis\n2:04\nto capture the entric uh value of the\n2:10\nPanera expansion plans.\n2:13\nAnd then uh my second step would be to\n2:16\nuh triangulate this against trading\n2:19\ncomps and precendent\n2:22\num transactions to establish market\n2:25\nceilings and fours. And then finally I\n2:28\nwill model the strategic premium to\n2:30\nqualify what a buyer like Starbucks\n2:32\nmight pay compared to KKR.\n2:36\nI'm using Python to automate these\n2:38\nsensitivity flows and visualize the\n2:40\nfinal football field. um valuation.\n2:46\nSo\n2:47\num moving to the implement stage um\n2:49\nlet's look at the model structure here\n2:51\non section one. Um I have priameitize\n2:55\nour inputs the iota\n2:58\nuh the the tax rate the whack um falling\n3:03\nfor dynamic sensit sensitivity testing\n3:06\num I have built these specific\n3:08\nscenarios. So the base case assumes that\n3:10\nthere's 5% steady growth. Um the upside\n3:14\nassumes that we hit the growth lever of\n3:16\n500 new stores pushing growth to 8%.\n3:20\nAnd the the downside is that we assume\n3:23\nthat execution failure uh drops the\n3:26\ngrowth to 2%.\n3:30\nUm so the uh DCF engine automates the\n3:32\nfree clash row conversion. When I\n3:35\nexecute this block, you can see the\n3:37\nsystem instantly calculates the\n3:40\ninterface value for all three scenarios,\n3:42\ngiving us a look at the um value ranges\n3:45\nbefore we even look at the market. So\n3:49\nthere's our scenario inputs and this is\n3:50\nthe visuals. Um\n3:53\nso like after running, now we're on the\n3:55\nvalidate stage. After validating our\n3:57\nfindings, we are looking at the\n4:00\ngenerated football field chart where we\n4:02\nsee the clear convergence. So our sanity\n4:06\ncheck uh\n4:09\nour base case of the DCF values Panera\n4:12\nis between 12 and 14 billion.\n4:15\nUm the market check uh this aligns\n4:19\nperfectly with the\n4:21\nuh the transaction range of the 12x to\n4:24\n15xa\n4:26\nwhich uh implies that the valuation of\n4:29\nthe 10.8 8 to 13.5 billion.\n4:33\nSome of the outliers. So note the comps\n4:36\nbar on the far right. Um\n4:40\nuh if we value Panera like Chipotle at\n4:43\n35 XPE,\n4:45\num the valuation skyrockets to 14\n4:48\nbillion plus. Um this validates that the\n4:51\nmarket pays a massive premium for\n4:53\ndigital maturity which Panera has at a\n4:56\n50% uh digital mix.\n4:59\nSo um to evolve this we can go to our um\n5:06\ngo to our sensitivity analysis and\n5:12\nwe can see that we must evolve our\n5:14\nanalysis to account for the bidder type.\n5:17\nUh this is the difference between the\n5:18\nKKR range and the strategic buyer.\n5:23\nUm so\n5:26\num the\n5:29\nthe financial buyer the KKKR is\n5:32\nrestrained by 9% whack and exit\n5:37\nmultiples. If we pay over 13.5 billion\n5:40\nor the 15x IATA our IRR is likely to\n5:45\ndrop below the 20% hurdle required for\n5:48\nthe leveraged buyout. So we have no\n5:50\nsynergies to offset the premiums.\n5:54\nAnd then a strategic buyer um like\n5:56\nStarbucks conservatively\n5:59\num can realize the cost synergies\n6:03\nconsolidate the supply chains and tech\n6:05\nstacks. Um they can justify the upside\n6:09\nprice of the 14.5 billion because their\n6:12\neffective post synergy multiple is\n6:14\nlower. the K KR risks being outbid here.\n6:20\nSo finally to reflect and provide a\n6:23\nrecommendation\n6:24\nI recommend KKR submit an opening bid of\n6:28\n11.5 billion. Um the reason I say this\n6:31\nis that this represents a 12.8x IIDA\n6:36\nmultiple. Um it anchors us near a\n6:40\nperfect president floor but acknowledges\n6:43\nthe strong um digital asset base. So our\n6:48\nnegotiation strategy is that we should\n6:50\nhighlight the 10% management rollover as\n6:53\na key uh differentiator. Um we offer\n6:56\nmanagement autonomy with a strategic\n6:59\nacquire like McDonald's would not.\n7:02\nUm, so our walkway price, our absolute\n7:05\nceiling should be around 13.5 billion.\n7:08\nBeyond this, we enter as a strategic\n7:10\nbuyer territory where the math really\n7:13\ndoesn't uh work for the financial\n7:15\nsponsor. If the bidding war goes higher,\n7:17\nwe are we disciplinedly walk away.\n7:21Thank you."
