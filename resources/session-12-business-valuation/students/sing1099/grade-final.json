  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and applied multiples to Panera's stated EBITDA (900M), converting multiples into valuation ranges and an advised bid (12.8x → $11.5B). The use of the DRIVER stages (discover → implement/validate → reflect) shows coherent application of comparable methodology at an introductory but thorough level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly conducted valuation triangulation (DCF vs. comps/transactions), produced numeric ranges from each approach, and ran sensitivity around bidder type and IRR to justify a recommended bid and ceiling. The analysis is specific, uses multiple methods, and explains which valuations are reasonable for a financial buyer versus a strategic buyer, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined a DCF with scenario-based projections, listed inputs including tax rate and a 9% WACC, and described automation of FCF conversion/discounting. They produced specific enterprise value outputs (e.g., $12–14B base case and other implied ranges), and triangulated against exit multiples—meeting the criterion for identifiable sections (Projections, WACC, TV/exit multiples, PV) and a numeric EV result.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly ties DCF to discounting projected free cash flows and explicitly uses a WACC (9%) as the discount rate, but the treatment is brief and lacks deeper explanation of present-value mechanics or multiple detailed examples. This meets basic conceptual requirements but not the thorough, detailed treatment required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions the DCF/“free cash flow” engine and follows DRIVER stages, but never identifies the FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor states that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital. This omission means the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student employs a DCF and explicitly references exit multiples (e.g., 15x) and price ceilings, indicating use of a multiples-based terminal/exit logic. However, they do not explicitly present a terminal value calculation nor state that terminal value comprises the majority of enterprise value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
