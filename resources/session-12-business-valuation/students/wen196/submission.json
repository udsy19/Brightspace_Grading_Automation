  "transcript": "0:01\nI'm Johanna Win. I'm from uh your 310\n0:05\nclass from 4:30 to 5:20 and we're going\n0:09\nover the final session. I might redo\n0:11\nthis a bit later, but this is what I\n0:14\nhave for right now. So uh our objective\n0:18\nis to deliver a full valuation of Panera\n0:21\nBread for prospective uh KKR takeover\n0:25\nusing Driver\n0:27\nuh combining you know DCF trading comps\n0:30\nand president transactions to produce an\n0:32\ninformed bid range while contrasting\n0:34\nfinancial buyer discipline with\n0:36\nstrategic buyer synergies. So in the in\n0:39\nthe deal snapshot is uh a scale of $900\n0:42\nmillion Ibida 15% margin um a $400\n0:47\nmillion uh net income across uh 20 2100\n0:52\nstores digital sales already 5 50%. Um\n0:56\nso that's a that's a good portion. Um\n0:58\nmarket uh references um industry uh PE\n1:04\num around 22 22x. Uh president of Ibidam\n1:09\nmultiplies 12 or 15x. Um I keep saying X\n1:14\nI mean times. Um Chipotle trades at 35\n1:18\ntimes. Uh PE McDonald's at 25 times. Um\n1:23\ncapital assumptions industry whack of\n1:25\n9%. uh management wants 10% rollover\n1:29\nstrategic biders. Starbucks, McDonald's\n1:32\nare circling. There's a growth levers of\n1:35\n500 new stores in 5 years. Uh digital\n1:38\nmix to 70%. Arguably, uh with the\n1:42\ntechnology that we have and with a lot\n1:44\nof people already ordering online like\n1:46\non Amazon, um it's going to probably\n1:49\nincrease. So, a digital mix to 70% would\n1:52\nbe good. uh diner catering expansion or\n1:55\nearly stage international roll out. Um\n1:59\ncreate an ex create an executive\n2:02\nexecutive ready recommendation that\n2:05\nstates your valuation range winning bid\n2:07\nstrategy and rationale for choosing\n2:09\nfinancial versus strategic positioning.\n2:13\nSo, uh I'm going to I'm you know I'm\n2:16\ngoing to read this off first before I\n2:18\nlook at the collab that I had uh Gemini\n2:21\nhelped me make. Um so we have our\n2:24\nprimary goal of\n2:26\nOh yeah. So I implemented um you know\n2:30\nthe the inputs what we have so far and\n2:35\nyou know Gemini helped me you know make\n2:38\nthis recommendation. Um and so\n2:44\nuh with\n2:46\nprimary goal there's a financial return\n2:48\num you know buying low to improve\n2:51\noperations. You know when you buy low\n2:53\nwhen like when something is undervalued\n2:56\num and you basically how you determine\n2:58\nit's undervalued you predict that it's\n2:59\ngoing to get bigger you're going to max\n3:02\nout your profitability if you invest now\n3:04\nand then you know sell later. Uh the\n3:07\nstrategic buyer is what that is. Um\n3:10\nvaluation basis standalone cash flow\n3:12\nfocused on the targets internal\n3:15\nachievable free cash flow um and its\n3:17\nability to service high debt levels.\n3:20\nSynergy driven willing to pay uh control\n3:22\npremium because they value business\n3:24\nbased on the combined entity cash flows\n3:27\nwhich include significant synergies full\n3:29\nof joy. Um management relies heavily on\n3:33\nexisting management. uh requires\n3:35\nmanagement rollover to ensure you know\n3:37\noperation continuity and stuff like\n3:40\nthat. So with with people\n3:44\nif you want what you already have um\n3:50\nlike if you think uh business is going\n3:51\nfine right now then you should keep your\n3:54\nmanagement.\n3:56\nUm if you want to start transitioning\n3:59\nover to maybe more AI or different um\n4:03\nprocesses or procedures with how your\n4:06\ncompany works, then you know\n4:10\nmaybe change management uh integration\n4:12\nof risk um you know lower uh lower\n4:17\nmostly financial operation improvements.\n4:19\nUm and the target remains largely\n4:21\nindependent from Yeah.\n4:24\nSo we're going to go over the synergy.\n4:27\nYeah, there's in uh operating leverage\n4:30\nstore overlap\n4:31\nor not that driver but\n4:35\num revenue synergies growth of digital\n4:38\nscale and cross-selling kind of like\n4:40\nwhat I said earlier uh financial\n4:42\nsynergies um is that uh optimizing\n4:46\ncapital uh structure refinancing you\n4:49\nknow debt at lower rates and tax\n4:50\nefficiency which will you know improve\n4:52\nour working capital. Um and then we have\n4:55\na you know the total annual run rate of\n4:58\n90 to 170 million. And then we have you\n5:01\nknow our risks of you know you know high\n5:05\nyou know buyers buyers like to\n5:08\nlike to have risky risky um\n5:13\nlike risky bets because people want more\n5:15\nmoney. Um so we we kind of went over\n5:18\nthis a couple weeks ago in class where\n5:20\nit's like why wouldn't um you know\n5:23\nbuyers\n5:24\nchoose like there's you I think you had\n5:28\nthe scenario of where there's like you\n5:30\nknow like a 50% chance of $200 million\n5:34\nand another 50% of losing $300 million.\n5:39\nUm but then the alternative option which\n5:41\nis the super risky option where you only\n5:43\nwin $100 million. Um, and then that like\n5:48\nyeah, it's like a guarantee uh like 90%\n5:50\nof $100 million and then like a 10% of a\n5:56\nmillion gazillion like a crap ton of\n6:00\nmoney. Totally not worth it to possibly\n6:03\nrisk. Um it's the risk is so outweighing\n6:08\num kind of maybe the $100 million that\n6:12\nyou're\n6:14\nlike kind of guaranteed to get with the\n6:16\n90%. But the reason why you know a lot\n6:19\nof investors might want you to push\n6:21\ntowards a more riskier option is because\n6:23\nthey might win more. However, in that\n6:25\nscenario in like in class $100 million\n6:28\nis less than $200 million. So\n6:32\nyeah, stuff like that. um cultural\n6:35\npersonal high significant risk losing\n6:38\nkey talent. Um full of joy kind of kind\n6:41\nof like the management. So we're going\n6:43\nto look over the collab. Um\n6:46\nAI really does rapidly improve cuz um\n6:50\nthere were there has not been uh any\n6:52\nmistakes with the coding when I asked\n6:55\nGemini to help me and look over it. Um\n7:01\nso we have a multi- scenario discounted\n7:04\ncash flows of 1 through 5 years and then\n7:07\nterminal um\n7:10\nand the value uh contribution is 115%\n7:15\nof estimated value and or enterprise\n7:19\nvalue of 11. Oh boy that's a lot of\n7:25\nmoney. That's\n7:27\ntrillion dollars.\n7:30\nThat's if all of this is a million then\n7:33\ngoodness. Um upside case um would be you\n7:37\nknow a 117 EV which a lot of money this\n7:43\nis even more. Um we have a downside case\n7:47\nof you know 9 trillion which is less\n7:52\nbecause the downside um and then the\n7:55\nwhack justification of 9%. Um bigger is\n7:59\nalways better um and we don't really\n8:03\nhave another whack to compare to right\n8:05\nnow. Um terminal value is 3% with a\n8:09\nperpetual growth rate. Um TV represents\n8:12\nthe 115.8% 8% total ED um which is in\n8:18\nwithin the acceptable range typically\n8:20\nbetween 50 and 80%.\n8:23\nUm\n8:24\nwith trading comps in president\n8:27\ntransactions we got the you know the\n8:29\nmultiple times the valuation the low and\n8:33\nlow and high estimate. Um for the whack\n8:35\nyou have the uh whack versus the\n8:37\nterminal growth growth being down here.\n8:42\nYou got the synergy capture sensitivity\n8:47\nand then DCF enterprise value\n8:49\nsensitivity to whack and terminal\n8:51\ngrowth. And so we have, you know, very\n8:55\nvery low and then we got very very high\n8:58\nbeing a higher whack\n9:00\nand a higher growth.\n9:04\nWe got uh kind of the triangulation of\n9:09\num you know got the median, got the high\n9:14\npoints,\n9:16\nso the low side, the upside,\n9:20\nwe got the trading comps of PE.\n9:25\nYeah. And so we have the recommended bid\n9:27\nstrategy down here and I translate it to\n9:29\nhere. Um so the indicated enterprise\n9:33\nvalue range you know the consolided one\n9:36\nis um 8K mil aka $8 billion\n9:42\nuh for and then to $14 billion with an\n9:45\naverage midpoint value of 11 billion uh\n9:49\nwith a recommended walk away price of $7\n9:52\nbillion\n9:53\nwhich is pretty good 10% below uh lowest\n9:57\nDC comps range um so buyer Synergy\n10:00\ncapture emphasizes the like more than\n10:03\n$100 million with an upside case synergy\n10:07\nto justify a higher bid framing it as\n10:09\nyou know KKR um can unlock um with\n10:14\nfinancial and versus strategic the base\n10:18\ncase of DCF financial buyer is near the\n10:21\nmiddle of the range. uh strategic\n10:24\nadviser can justify a patrol control\n10:27\npremium for store overlap and operating\n10:30\nleverage. Uh management rollover\n10:33\nsuccessful deal requires key management\n10:36\nlike we kind of said earlier with what\n10:37\nwe had up there. Um\n10:40\nand all that jazz.\n10:43\nSo go back. Recommended bid strategy\n10:48\nis this with a walk away price. Yes.\n10:53Thank you so"
