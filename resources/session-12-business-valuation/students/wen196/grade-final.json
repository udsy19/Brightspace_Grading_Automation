  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames a multi‑scenario DCF with projected free cash flows and a terminal value and cites a discount rate (\"whack\" 9%), demonstrating the core DCF idea of valuing future free cash flows using WACC. Implementation and reflection comments show the method was applied and reviewed, providing sufficient depth for an introductory PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions), performed sensitivity analyses, and reported a consolidated EV range with midpoint and walk-away price. They also discussed which valuation (DCF as financial-buyer baseline vs. strategic premium) is most reasonable, meeting the criterion for thorough comparative discussion.\n- Technical Implementation: Student explicitly includes projections (1–5 years), a terminal value (3% mentioned elsewhere), a WACC (\"whack\") at 9%, and reports a specific numerical enterprise value range and midpoint ($8B–$14B, $11B midpoint). The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) corroborate that the DCF structure was built and tested, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of free cash flow and applies multi-scenario DCFs (Discover/Implement) and notes FCF's role in servicing debt, but they do not explicitly identify the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital. This shows correct but incomplete conceptual treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value (3% perpetual growth) and states TV comprises the majority of enterprise value, satisfying the criterion at a basic level. However, the treatment is uneven and numerically inconsistent (e.g., claiming 115.8% vs citing a 50–80% benchmark) and lacks deeper explanation, so the response is correct but incomplete — PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (1–5 years) and a terminal period and cites a terminal growth rate (3%) and near-term growth levers (new stores, higher digital mix), demonstrating correct conceptual treatment. However, they do not provide detailed year-by-year growth assumptions or a substantive justification/sensitivity analysis for the chosen rates, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",
