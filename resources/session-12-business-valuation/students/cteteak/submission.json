I'm here today to\n0:04\npresent our comprehensive valuation of\n0:07\nPanera Bread and to propose a strategic\n0:09\nbid for its acquisition.\n0:12\nAs we look at this opportunity, our core\n0:14\nproblem is straightforward but critical.\n0:16\nWe need to determine the right price to\n0:18\npay for Panera. This isn't just about\n0:20\nfinding a number. It's about finding a\n0:22\nprice that reflects Panera's intrinsic\n0:24\nvalue while ensuring we as KKR can\n0:27\nachieve our target internal rates of\n0:29\nreturn. Our objective today is\n0:32\nthree-fold. Establish a\n0:35\nuh credible bid range for using robust\n0:38\nmethodologies. Uh contrast our position\n0:40\nas a financial buyer against potential\n0:42\nstrategic competitors who might pay uh\n0:45\nmore for synergies and then deliver a\n0:47\nwinning bid strategy that gets the deal\n0:49\ndone without overpaying.\n0:51\nUm we have synthesized historical\n0:54\nfinancials uh management projections for\n0:56\nthe next 5 to 10 years and the rigorous\n0:58\nmarket data\n1:00\nto uh to build this case. Next for the\n1:04\nrepresent phase let's briefly touch on\n1:06\nhow we modeled this. We didn't rely on a\n1:08\nsingle source of truth. We used a\n1:09\ntriangulation approach the football\n1:11\nfield method to minimize blind spots.\n1:14\nFirst we built a multi-senario\n1:16\ndiscounted cash flow a DCF model. This\n1:19\nlooks at the intrinsic value of the\n1:21\nbusiness uh based on its future cash\n1:23\nflows. We modeled a base case, an upside\n1:26\ncase uh where the growth in uh\n1:29\ninitiatives\n1:30\naccelerate in a downside case to protect\n1:32\nour downside risk.\n1:35\nSecond, we looked at the market via\n1:37\ncomparable company analysis. We compared\n1:39\nPanera to its public peers, fast casual\n1:42\ngiants like Chipotle and stalwarts like\n1:44\nMcDonald's to see how the public market\n1:47\nvalues similar cash flows. Third, we\n1:50\nutilize the president precedent\n1:52\ntransaction analysis. We looked at what\n1:54\nbuyers have actually paid for similar\n1:56\nrestaurant assets in M&A deals over the\n1:59\npast few years. Crucially, we viewed\n2:01\nthis through two lenses. The financial\n2:03\nbuyer or us. Uh we focused on\n2:06\noperational improvements, leverage and\n2:08\nexit multiples. The strategic buyer, a\n2:12\nhypothetical competitor um like\n2:14\nStarbucks or GA jab holdings who could\n2:18\nrealize immediate cost and re revenue\n2:20\nsynergies. We quantified these synergies\n2:22\nto understand the ceiling price a\n2:24\ncompetitor might build.\n2:27\nNext for the implement phase is the\n2:29\nnumbers and the actual analysis itself.\n2:31\nSo let's dive into the intrinsic value.\n2:33\nIn our DCF analysis, we projected free\n2:35\ncash flow over 5-year horizon. In our\n2:38\nbase case, we assumed moderate revenue\n2:40\ngrowth driven by new store openings and\n2:42\ndigital uh maturation. In the strategic\n2:45\nupside cases, we factored in aggressive\n2:48\ngrowth levers, uh menu innovation,\n2:50\nsupply chain optimization, and then unit\n2:52\nexpansion. Using these projections, we\n2:54\ncalculated a base case enterprise value\n2:57\nof roughly 23.1 billion and an upside\n3:00\ncase of 32.7 billion. Then moving on to\n3:03\nour validate phase, um moving to the bar\n3:07\nthe market benchmarks, uh when we look\n3:09\nat the comparable companies, uh the\n3:11\nvaluations are robust. Public markets\n3:14\nare rewarding fast casual concepts with\n3:16\nhigh multiples, particularly those with\n3:18\nstrong digital footprints like Panera.\n3:21\nHowever, when we actually look at the\n3:22\nprecedent transactions, the valuation\n3:24\nrange is generally lower. This\n3:26\ndiscrepancy suggests that while public\n3:28\nsentiment is high, actual deal making in\n3:31\nthe sector has historically happened at\n3:32\nmore conservative multiples. We also\n3:35\napplied a control premium to these\n3:37\nmarket metrics. Since we are buying 100%\n3:39\nof the company, we must pay for that\n3:41\nprivilege. This adjustment shifts the\n3:43\nvaluation upwards, aligning the market\n3:45\ndata closer to our intrinsic DCF\n3:48\ncalculations.\n3:52\nSo here is the actual football field\n3:54\nvisual. Um this visual synthesizes all\n3:58\nof our valuation method methodologies\n4:00\ninto one view. On the far left you can\n4:03\nsee the DCF downside which sets our\n4:06\nabsolute floor. We absolutely uh we\n4:08\nobviously cannot bid here as it would\n4:10\nnever be acceptable. On the far right\n4:12\nyou can see the CCA control adjusted\n4:14\nranges. These represent the absolute\n4:16\nceiling likely where a desperate\n4:18\nstrategic buyer might play but a danger\n4:20\nzone for a disciplined financial buyer\n4:22\nlike KKR. The sweet spot. Our analysis\n4:26\nshows a convergence of the values in the\n4:28\nmiddle. The DCFbased case, the DCFbased\n4:31\ncase, the strategic DCF and the median\n4:34\nand market multiples all cluster in a\n4:36\nspecific corridor. This triangulation um\n4:39\ngives us high confidence that the true\n4:41\nvalue of the asset pricing and risk but\n4:43\nacknowledge acknowledging the potential\n4:45\nlies between roughly 4.5 billion and 7.5\n4:48\nbillion.\n4:50\nThen to our evolve phase based on this\n4:53\ntriangulation here is our actual\n4:54\nrecommendation. We recommend KKR submit\n4:57\na bid in the range of 6 billion to 6.8\n4:59\nuh billion. Here is the rationale for\n5:02\nthis specific range. It is competitive.\n5:05\nThis range sits above the median\n5:06\nprecedent transactions ensuring we\n5:08\naren't lowballed out of the room\n5:09\nimmediately. It captures intrinsic\n5:11\nvalue. It aligns perfectly with our\n5:13\nstrategic upside DCF models and then it\n5:16\npays for the value Panera is creating\n5:19\nbut leaves the value we will create uh\n5:21\nfor our investors. It acknowledges the\n5:23\ncontrol premium. At this price we are\n5:25\neffectively paying a premium over the\n5:28\nadjusted uh the unadjusted market value\n5:30\nwhich is necessary to take the company\n5:32\nprivate.\n5:34\nSo the actual strategy, we are not just\n5:37\nthrowing a number at them. Our bid\n5:38\nstrategy relies on four pillars. Those\n5:41\nbeing leverage. Uh we will structure\n5:43\nthis as an LBO using 60 to 70% debt to\n5:46\namplify our equity returns. Um\n5:48\noperational value creation. We aren't\n5:51\npaying for synergies we can't realize.\n5:53\nInstead, our model relies on KKR's\n5:55\nplaybook. um digital transformation,\n5:57\nsupply chain optimization and expanding\n6:00\nthe unit control\n6:02\nmanagement rollover. This is critical.\n6:04\nWe are crying a 10% management rollover.\n6:08\nThis reduces our upfront equity check\n6:09\nand more importantly aligns the\n6:11\nmanagement team's incentives with ours.\n6:14\nWe want them hungry for the second exit.\n6:16\nDiscipline. We must remain disciplined.\n6:19\nIf the bidding war pushes past our upper\n6:21\nrange towards like the 7.5 billion\n6:23\nrange, we are entering strategic buyer\n6:25\nterritory. At that price, the returns\n6:27\nare likely too compressed for our 20 to\n6:29\n25% irr targets.\n6:33\nLastly, for our reflect phase, before we\n6:35\nconclude, I just want to reflect on the\n6:37\nrisks and the assumptions embedded here.\n6:39\nUm, our valuation is highly sensitive to\n6:41\nrevenue growth and margin assumptions.\n6:44\nIf the fast casual sector cools or if\n6:46\nwage inflations erode margins uh erodess\n6:49\nmargins faster than we could raise our\n6:51\nprices, our base case DCF contracts\n6:53\nsignificantly.\n6:55\nFurthermore, we must be aware of the\n6:57\nintegration risks. While we identified\n6:59\npotential synergies executing on them,\n7:02\nparticularly like the IR the IT\n7:04\nintegration and supply chain merging, um\n7:07\nit is never seamless. This is why we\n7:09\nhave kept our bid recommendation below\n7:11\nthe maximum strategic value. we need a\n7:13\nlittle bit of a margin for safety. So\n7:15\nkind of just in summary uh Panera is a\n7:17\nhighquality uh asset with a defensible\n7:20\nmoat in the fast casual space by between\n7:23\nbidding between 6 uh 6 billion and 6.8\n7:27\nbillion leveraging a disciplined capital\n7:29\nstructure and locking in management with\n7:31\na rollover. We believe this acquisition\n7:34\nrepresents a prime opportunity for KKR\n7:36\nto deploy capital with a high\n7:38\nprobability of outside returns outsized\n7:41returns. Thank you."
