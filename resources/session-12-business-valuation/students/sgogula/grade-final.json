  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly projects free cash flows and discounts them using a stated WACC and terminal value, meeting the core DCF methodology. They also provide supporting assumptions (capex, NWC, terminal growth) and triangulate results with comps/precedents, demonstrating thorough, decision-useful treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast from a terminal period and provides scenario-based near-term growth rates (5/8/11%) with a lower terminal growth (2–3%), plus supporting operational drivers (store adds, digital mix). The assumptions are reasonable and justified for a mature restaurant, demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected relevant peers (McDonald's, Chipotle) and applied valuation multiples (PE to net income; precedent EV/EBITDA to EBITDA) with concrete numeric results and triangulation across methods, demonstrating a thorough introductory comparable methodology consistent with the driver framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models FCF components by specifying CapEx and working capital assumptions and applies firm-level FCF by discounting at WACC, showing awareness that cash flow underpins returns to capital providers. However, the treatment is incomplete—depreciation and explicit EBIT/NOPAT adjustments are not mentioned and the discussion lacks the depth and explicit component linkage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value and even specifies terminal growth rates (indicating use of the growth-method), satisfying part of the criterion. However, they do not acknowledge or quantify that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript reports DCF and comparable valuation figures and explicitly labels a PE‑based \"equity value,\" but it contains no mention of subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) from enterprise value nor of dividing equity value by share count to yield price per share. Implement and Discover stages show valuation work but lack the required EV→Equity bridge and per‑share conversion, so the criterion is not met.",
