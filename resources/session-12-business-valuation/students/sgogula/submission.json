The goal is\n0:12\nto determine a credible bid range\n0:14\ntriangulation across DF DCF trading\n0:16\ncomparables and president transactions\n0:19\nand then clearly explain why a financial\n0:20\nbuyer like KKR values Panera differently\n0:22\nthan a strategic buyer such as Starbucks\n0:24\nor McDonald's. Panera is a scaled cash\n0:27\nuh generative restaurant platform with a\n0:29\nstrong digital penetration and runway\n0:31\nfor expansion making it a compelling but\n0:33\ncompetitive bid asset. So this is the\n0:36\ndeal snapshot. So let's start with the\n0:38\ndeal snapshot. Panera generates\n0:40\napproximately $6 billion in revenue\n0:44\ngrowing about $8% annually with 900\n0:47\nmillion of ABTA\n0:49\nimplying a 15% margin. Net income is\n0:52\nroughly 400 million and the company\n0:53\noperates over 2,900 stores with digital\n0:55\nsales already accounting for 50% of\n0:57\nrevenue. From a market perspective,\n0:59\nindustry PE averages around 20 two\n1:01\ntimes. Resident transaction clusters\n1:03\nbetween 12 times and 15 times. EIDA\n1:08\nreportedly trades at 35 times PE.\n1:10\nMcDonald's trades at 25 XP. Capital\n1:14\nassumptions reflect an industry WCC of\n1:16\n9%. Management intends to roll over 10%\n1:18\nequity and strategic buyers are actively\n1:20\ncircling which matters for pricing\n1:21\npressure. I selected this valuation\n1:24\nusing driver which ensures that\n1:25\nvalidation isn't just mechanical but\n1:27\ndecision useful. So I started with\n1:29\nassumptions revenue growth varies with\n1:31\nscenario 5% downside 8% base and 11%\n1:34\nupside ad\n1:36\nmargins raise from 13% to 18% reflecting\n1:39\nexecution risk versus operational upside\n1:41\nfrom scale and digital leverage.\n1:42\nReinvestment is conservative. Capex at\n1:45\n4% of revenue. Networking capital at 1%\n1:47\nof revenue. Terminal growth ranges from\n1:49\n2% to 3% consistent with mature but\n1:52\nexpanding restaurant concepts. These\n1:54\nconsumptions reflect Panera's growth\n1:56\nlevers. Uh 500 new stores over 5 years.\n1:58\nDigital mix expanding to 70% digital and\n2:02\ndinner and catering expansion early\n2:04\ninternational rollout. And then I\n2:06\nimplemented the TCF valuation results.\n2:12\nUnder these assumptions, I projected\n2:14\nfive years of free cash flow and\n2:15\ndiscounted them at 9% WACC including a\n2:18\nterminal value which and the results are\n2:20\nDF DCF downside of $4.7 billion, DCF\n2:24\nbase case of 5 $7.5 billion and DCF\n2:27\nupside of 12.3 billion. This wide range\n2:30\nreflects sensitivity to growth and\n2:31\nmargin expansion which is exactly what\n2:33\nwe expect in a consumer discretionary\n2:34\nbusiness. For a financial buyer like\n2:36\nKKR, the base case is the anchor because\n2:38\nreturns must come from cash flow,\n2:40\nleverage, and disciplined exit multiples\n2:42\nand not revenue synergies. Next, I\n2:45\nvalidated the DCF using trading\n2:47\ncomparables focusing on PE multiples\n2:49\napplied to Panera's $400 million in net\n2:51\nincome. Industry average at 2x implies\n2:55\n8.8 billion equity value. McDonald's at\n2:58\n25x implies 10 billion and Chipotle at\n3:02\n35x implies 14 billion. Panera clearly\n3:04\ndoes not reserve chipotles chipotle\n3:06\nlevel multiples today. But these comps\n3:08\nestablish a credible market ceiling and\n3:11\nconfirm that DCFA is not aggressive.\n3:14\nLooking at president transactions,\n3:17\nrestaurant deals have cleared 12 times\n3:19\nto 15x ABI\n3:22\nDDA. Applying those multiples to\n3:23\nPanera's 900 million ABIDA yields low of\n3:28\n10.8 billion, mid of 12.2 2 billion and\n3:31\na high of $13.5 billion.\n3:36\nAnd these numbers are meaningful\n3:38\nthrough uh above the financial buyer DCF\n3:41\nbase case reinforcing that auction\n3:43\ndynamics and strategic interest pushing\n3:46\nprice upwards. Now this is where the\n3:48\nbuyer type matters strategic buyers like\n3:50\nStarbucks and McDonald's can extract\n3:52\nvalue that KKR cannot. So I model most\n3:55\nuh model synergies 2% revenue uplift 200\n3:57\nbasis point margin improvement calcized\n3:59\nover time. This value this lift shift\n4:02\nvalue this lifts value slightly above\n4:04\nthe base DCF but more importantly it\n4:06\nexplains why strategics can rationally\n4:08\noutbid financial sponsors while\n4:10\naccepting lower standalone returns\n4:11\nstrategic buys integration and ecosystem\n4:13\nvalue financial buyers by cash flow\n4:16\ndiscipline. When we place all the\n4:18\nmethods on the football field, DCF spans\n4:20\n3.7 billion to 12.3 billion. Trading\n4:22\ncomp center around 9 to 11 billion,\n4:24\nprecedence cluster 10.8 to um to 13.5\n4:28\nbillion. Strategic value pushes towards\n4:30\nthe upper end. And this triangulation\n4:32\nclear tells a clear story that intrinsic\n4:34\nvalue supports the mid7 billion range.\n4:36\nMarket clearing sits closer to 10 to 12\n4:38\nbillion. Strategics justify the top end\n4:41\nand financial buyers must stay\n4:43\ndisciplined. So what should KKR do? The\n4:46\nrecommended valuation range is that KKR\n4:48\nbid range is between 7 billion to 8\n4:50\nbillion and the walkway point is 8.5\n4:52\nbillion. Strategic clearing price is 10\n4:54\nbillion plus dollars. KKR should anchor\n4:58\non base DCF emphasize management\n5:00\nrollover structured returns may large\n5:02\nleverage and operational discipline and\n5:04\navoid overpaying in a strategic driven\n5:06\nauction. And the bottom line is that\n5:08\nPanera is an excellent business but all\n5:11\nthe wrong price becomes a bad investment\n5:12\nfor KKR. Value creation comes from\n5:14\nexecution, not synergies. If the deal\n5:16\nclears at a strategic price, correct\n5:18\ndecision is not to win the auction. That\n5:20\nis the disciplined financial buyer\n5:21\nanswer. Thank you."
