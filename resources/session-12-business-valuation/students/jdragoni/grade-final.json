  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present value of future free cash flows, constructs UFCF as the DCF input, and states and applies a WACC (9%) with sensitivity analysis. These elements show a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF methodology across the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies the FCF calculation inputs (earnings → taxes/NOPAT implied, change in working capital, maintenance and growth CapEx) and states unlevered free cash flow is the cash available to all capital providers. Multiple model descriptions, projections, and the cash-vs-EBITDA reflection demonstrate a thorough, applied conceptual grasp consistent with a PASS under the moderate-standard rubric.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly calculates terminal value (both perpetuity and exit-multiple approaches) and reports numeric TV-based enterprise values. The sensitivity discussion demonstrates the student recognizes terminal assumptions (growth/multiple) materially drive valuation, satisfying a thorough conceptual treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual use of UFCF→EV and uses EV to set a bid (Discover/Implement/Validate), but they do not explicitly bridge EV to Equity Value (no mention of subtracting net debt) nor do they divide by share count to produce a Price Per Share. That omission prevents a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student compared their valuation to market peers, comps, and precedent-transaction ranges and ran a stress (stagflation) case, demonstrating external-style validation and discussion of limitations. However, they did not cite specific external sources/tools (e.g., websites, databases, calculators) as required for a full PASS under the category-specific standard, so the evidence supports a partial pass.",
