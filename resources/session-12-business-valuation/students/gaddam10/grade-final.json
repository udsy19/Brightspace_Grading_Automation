  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF as valuation from free cash flows, implements it in code (FCF projections and terminal value), and explicitly uses and tests weighted average cost of capital as the discounting parameter. Multiple scenario examples and a WACC sensitivity check demonstrate a thorough, applied introductory understanding, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implemented a terminal value calculation and quantified its contribution (75–80% of EV), plus discussed sensitivity to WACC and growth—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of the terminal value concept. These points satisfy the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied and compared multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedents), reported their clustered results, ran sensitivity checks, and justified a 15–17B bid range relative to those valuations. These elements demonstrate a thorough, integrated triangulation and sensitivity analysis, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly treats FCF as the basis for enterprise value and models FCF scenarios, including capex and tax inputs, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly break out or document the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, capex, changes in working capital) or show their aggregation, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast period (5‑year FCF projection tied to new store rollouts) and computes a terminal value, and they present short‑term scenario growth rates (9.5% / 7%) with sensitivity analysis. However, they do not state or justify a specific long‑term terminal growth rate numerically or provide deeper rationale tying short‑term to lower long‑term assumptions, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses enterprise value (DCF) and also explains deriving equity value via P/E (net income × P/E), demonstrating partial understanding of EV vs. equity concepts. However, they do not explicitly state subtracting net debt from EV to arrive at equity value nor dividing equity value by shares to get price per share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
