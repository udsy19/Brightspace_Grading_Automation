  "transcript": "0:00\nToday we'll be looking at a\n0:02\ncomprehensive business valuation for\n0:04\nPanera and we'll perform a full\n0:07\nvaluation for a potential leverage\n0:09\nbuyout by a financial buyer. And this\n0:13\nanalysis will integrate three valuation\n0:15\nmethodologies DCF trading comps and\n0:18\nprecedent transactions to establish a\n0:20\njustifiable bid range.\n0:23\nSo here's our core parameters.\n0:26\nSo we have our target revenue, our\n0:29\ntarget EBIT TDA, our target net income,\n0:33\nour store count, our digital sales mix,\n0:36\nour base weighted average cost of\n0:38\ncapital, and our management rollover.\n0:42\nAnd we also have some valuation\n0:44\nassumptions and market data. So we have\n0:46\nour industry um P slash E our president\n0:50\nEB IDA\n0:53\num Chipotle P SE E McDonald's P S E cost\n0:57\nof capital and terminal growth rate and\n1:02\nsome growth lovers that we have we have\n1:04\nnew store roll out so we have 500 new\n1:08\nstores opening over the past five years\n1:11\nand we have our digital mix which is\n1:13\ngoing to increase 70% % we have our\n1:16\nexpansion dinner/catering growth and\n1:19\nearly stage international growout.\n1:23\nSo we'll be using all of these inputs to\n1:26\ndetermine our financial decisions and\n1:30\nour required outputs triangulated\n1:32\nvaluation range scenario analysis and\n1:35\nexecutive recommendation. We'll be going\n1:37\nthrough all of this in our analysis. So\n1:39\nnext to our present stage. This stage\n1:41\nwill formulize all our models and our\n1:42\nanalytical plan using financial\n1:44\nformulas. So our financial model\n1:47\nformulation. First we have our\n1:48\ndiscounted cash flow model. And this\n1:51\nvaluation will be based on enterprise\n1:53\nvalue derived from free cash flow. So we\n1:56\nhave our formula written out here. And\n1:59\nthis is going to incorporate growth\n2:00\ndrivers. So revenue will be projected\n2:02\nbased on existing store revenue um plus\n2:06\nnew revenue from the new store. And then\n2:10\nwe'll look at operating cost. So cost of\n2:12\ngoods sold and other inputs are\n2:14\nprojected as a percentage of revenue\n2:16\nreflecting the EVDA margin target. And\n2:20\nthen second valuation multiples so\n2:24\ntrading comps so other companies.\n2:27\num we're going to be using PE and some\n2:30\nother equation multiples from the peer\n2:32\ngroup. So other restaurants like\n2:35\nChipotle, McDonald's and apply them to\n2:37\nPanera's LTM metrics. So we'll be\n2:40\nlooking at equity value and we'll get\n2:43\nthat by taking net income slash the P&\n2:46\nmultiple\n2:48\nas well as equity value. And then\n2:51\nprecedent transactions will be using the\n2:53\n12 to 15 um EBITVA range to define the\n2:59\num estimated value range implied by\n3:01\nprior M&A deals in the quick service\n3:04\nrestaurant sector.\n3:06\nSo our analytical plan we're going to\n3:08\ndefine scenarios. So we'll establish\n3:11\nthree FCF scenarios based on varying\n3:13\nrevenue growth, margin capture and\n3:16\ncapeex assumptions. We'll model DCF by\n3:19\nimplementing the DCF model in Python.\n3:22\nUm, calculating FCF and TV for each\n3:25\nscenario. Third, we'll calculate comps,\n3:27\ndetermine valuation ranges based on PE\n3:30\nand ED/EVITDA\n3:32\ncomps. Fourth, we'll incorporate buyer\n3:35\nperspective. So, we'll quantify a 400\n3:38\nmillion operating synergy assumption for\n3:41\nthe strategic buyer. And then fifth,\n3:43\nwe'll combine the three valuation\n3:46\nmethods into a final bid range and\n3:48\npropose the winning strategy\n3:49\nimplementation. I'll show you the Python\n3:51\ncode.\n3:53\nSo here's the code. We have our inputs.\n3:55\nTax rate, um, weighted average, cost of\n3:57\ncapital base, growth, percentage, and\n4:02\nsome other inputs that we're going to\n4:04\ntake into account.\n4:06\nAnd then um our scenario definitions,\n4:11\nour DCF modeling functions.\n4:14\nThis will be all our um equations that\n4:18\nwe're going to be using to calculate our\n4:19\nvalues. So terminal value calculation,\n4:23\ntotal value, DCF valuation,\n4:27\nand just how we're going to run it. And\n4:30\nthen this will be our comparable company\n4:32\nanalysis.\n4:34\nSo our different companies and their\n4:37\ninputs\n4:39\nand then we'll just run the code to get\n4:41\nour values.\n4:43\nSo here's our DCF base case FCF\n4:46\nprojection in millions. So we can see\n4:50\nbased on this table that the revenue is\n4:53\ngoing to increase over the 5year span as\n4:56\nwell as the EVITDA\n4:59\nthat's also going to increase except a\n5:01\nbit more gradually.\n5:03\nAnd then the free cash flow that's also\n5:05\ngoing to increase as well. So these\n5:07\nnumbers are promising and signifies that\n5:11\nit's a good idea to pursue this business\n5:13\ndecision. And so the comparable company\n5:16\nanalysis shows the enterprise value of\n5:19\nPanera based on the value of other\n5:21\nstores if we were going to trade at the\n5:22\nsame cost as them. And so the calculated\n5:26\nvalues are promising and again shows\n5:28\nthat pursuing this business decision\n5:30\nwould be a good idea.\n5:33\nAnd here's our final valuation\n5:35\nsynthesis. So again we have good numbers\n5:37\nbased on our calculations.\n5:41\nSo\n5:43\nmoving to verification\n5:46\num this stage will confirm the\n5:47\nconsistency and constraints of the\n5:49\nvaluation model. So DCF consistency the\n5:52\nbase case FCF grow steadily and the\n5:54\nEBITDA margin remains at 15% consistent\n5:58\nwith assumptions. The base case DCF\n6:01\nvalue of around 14 million. The terminal\n6:04\nvalue check the total value accounts for\n6:07\naround 75 to 80% of the EV which is\n6:11\nstandard for a mature slow growing\n6:13\nbusiness like a QR chain. Uh\n6:16\ntriangulation spread the DCF is around\n6:19\n14 billion. the comps of around 13\n6:23\nbillion and then precedents um around\n6:27\n13.5 billion using the 15 multiple\n6:31\nand these three methods cluster between\n6:33\n12.6 billion and 14.4 4 billion and this\n6:37\nexcludes strategic scenaries providing a\n6:39\ntight credible range and then\n6:42\nsensitivity check using weighted average\n6:44\ncost of capital and the growth the value\n6:47\nis highly sensitive to the weighted\n6:48\naverage cost of capital and the growth\n6:50\ndenominator in the TV calculation.\n6:53\nSo the upside scenario um and this takes\n6:56\ninto account a weighted average cost of\n6:58\ncapital of 8% in 9.5 revenue growth. um\n7:02\nenterprise value would be around 20\n7:04\nmillion\n7:06\nand the high growth scenario is highly\n7:07\nvaluable and then the downside scenario\n7:10\nso a weight average cost of capital of\n7:12\n10% and a 7% growth rate for revenue.\n7:17\nThe estimated value would be around um\n7:20\n11 million. So the evolve stage we'll be\n7:22\nrefining the analysis by detailing the\n7:24\nfinal hypothetical football field and\n7:27\nthe financial versus strategic buyer\n7:29\ncontrast.\n7:31\nSo our valuation methods, our DCF, our\n7:33\ntrading comps, our precedent\n7:35\ntransactions and our strategic buyer\n7:38\nsynergy adjustment. We have our minimum\n7:41\nenterprise value or max enterprise value\n7:43\nand our key assumptions. These are just\n7:46\nour inputs that I already showed earlier\n7:49\nand the assumptions based on that. So a\n7:52\nbuyer perspective summary are valuation\n7:55\nfloor the DCF downside of around 11\n7:58\nbillion and precedence of around 13\n7:59\nbillion highly disciplined on WACCC and\n8:02\nKEX and the strategic buyer the DCF base\n8:06\nis around 14.4 4 billion plus synergies\n8:08\nand a higher floor due to synergy NPV.\n8:12\nA key advantage is our operating\n8:14\nleverage and cost cutting aggressive LBO\n8:17\nstructure a 10% management rollover and\n8:21\nwhich would ensure incentive alignment\n8:24\nand our synergy capture a store overlap\n8:27\nprocurement scale digital platform\n8:29\nintegration and cross-selling\n8:32\nand then a willingness to pay. uh this\n8:34\nwould be limited by required IRRa of\n8:37\naround which would be likely around 20%.\n8:41\nAnd we cannot justify paying for\n8:42\nsynergies and then a high control\n8:44\npremium justified by quantified GNA and\n8:47\noperating synergies.\n8:49\nSo finally our reflection recommendation\n8:53\nstage.\n8:54\nSo our recommended our recommended bid\n8:57\nstrategy um our recommended bid range\n9:00\nfor our target enterprise value uh is\n9:04\naround 15 to 17 billion and this range\n9:07\nsits above the financial buyers base DCF\n9:10\nbut well below the strategic buyer\n9:12\nsynergistic valuation\n9:15\nand this would be the optimal\n9:16\nnegotiation zone and our rationale is\n9:19\nthe KKR winning strategy. So the KKR\n9:22\nmust win by leveraging its financial\n9:23\nstructure and not by out bidding on\n9:25\nsynergies. So a winning bid strategy,\n9:27\nthe KKR must submit a bid at the 15\n9:30\nbillion mark, positioning itself as a\n9:32\ncredible anchor bid above the\n9:33\npresident/com's average but below the\n9:36\nlikely strategic bids and the 17 billion\n9:39\nis the walk away price.\n9:41\nAnd then to the financial discipline,\n9:43\nthe KKR justifies its higher than\n9:45\naverage bid by relying on the upside DCF\n9:47\nscenario of around 20 billion arguing\n9:50\nthat Operational expertise will lead to\n9:52\naggressive capeex optimization and\n9:55\nimproved EP ITDA margin.\n9:58\nAnd then third, strategic positioning.\n10:01\nThe KKR should emphasize a 10%\n10:03\nmanagement rollover which signals to the\n10:04\ncurrent Panera management that KKR\n10:07\noffers continuity and financial\n10:09\nincentives whereas a strategic buyer may\n10:11\neliminate their roles entirely. This\n10:14\nnon-financial factor is KKR's leverage.\n10:16\nAnd then fourth, financing. The final\n10:18\nbid must be funded by a highly efficient\n10:20\nLBO structure where the 10% equity\n10:22\nrollover acts as a cheap source of\n10:25\ninitial equity maximizing KRA's leverage\n10:28\nand an internal rate of return. Uh Kara\n10:31\nstrength lies not in the purchase price\n10:33\nbut in the exit price and the IRRa\n10:35\noptimization through the holding period.\n10:39\nUm I did use Gemini for the Python code\n10:41\nand the overall template, but I made\n10:43\nsure to verify the calculations and add\n10:45\nin my own analysis.\n10:48\nAnd so this is my um assignment for the\n10:51\ncomprehensive business valuation for\n10:53\nPanera. Thank you."
