  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines free cash flow to the firm, uses WACC (9%) to discount cash flows, and models terminal value via a perpetual growth formula—demonstrating both key DCF components. Implementation and validation steps (code assumptions and sensitivity analysis) show thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly lists the FCF components and the FCF-to-firm formulation and shows application in a modeled DCF discounted at WACC, demonstrating both conceptual and practical mastery. DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) provide concrete evidence of correct identification and use of FCF as cash available to all capital providers, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value using both the Gordon (perpetual growth) model and exit multiples (12–15x EBIT), and the analysis and results call out that terminal value constitutes a large share of enterprise value. These elements demonstrate a thorough, well-integrated understanding of the terminal value concept.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes enterprise value and references trading comparables as equity-value benchmarks, and the code ran to produce outputs (Implement + Validate). However, the transcript does not explicitly show the required bridge steps of subtracting net debt (debt less cash) from EV and dividing by share count to arrive at price per share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies multiples (PE, EBIT exit multiple 12–15x) and implements market-multiple checks in the model, demonstrating correct methodology. However, they do not identify or discuss specific peer companies (e.g., Chipotle, McDonald's) or show peer-level multiples applied to Panera’s metrics, so the treatment is correct but incomplete. Hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly describes and implements identifiable DCF sections (projections, terminal value, WACC/discounting, and PV aggregation) and reports enterprise value comparisons across scenarios, demonstrating correct structure and workflow. However, no specific numeric enterprise value is provided in the transcript, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
