  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly derives free cash flow, runs discounted cash flows and aggregates to enterprise value, and uses a stated WACC (0.09) while recommending a dynamic WACC—demonstrating correct, applied understanding of DCF methodology. The combination of model representation, implemented code, and reflection on WACC constitutes a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes identifiable DCF sections (projections/FCF, discounted cash flows/PV, terminal value) and cites an explicit WACC assumption, and reports a specific numeric Enterprise Value (~$20.66B). Minor implementation issues (10-year vs. required 5-year) were noted in validation but do not negate that the DCF structure and numeric EV are present.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission clearly integrates qualitative business judgment (investment thesis, management rollover, KPIs) with quantitative outputs (FCF, DCF, exit multiple, comps) and delivers a final recommendation. The work follows a logical flow across Discover → Represent → Implement → Evolve, and the student also demonstrates reflective improvements (sensitivity, dynamic WACC), indicating thorough, integrated analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes taxes, CapEx, and changes in working capital in their FCF formula and links cash flows to a DCF/enterprise value, indicating some firm-level (provider-of-capital) understanding. However, they do not explicitly include or add back depreciation/non-cash charges (or state NOPAT/EBIT clearly), and the treatment is simplified and brief. This meets a correct but incomplete conceptual treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly implements a terminal value using the exit-multiple method (Implement/Represent), so the calculation component is present. However, there is no explicit discussion acknowledging that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF's value, only general reflection on model improvements; therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast period (5-year FCF) from a terminal value (exit-multiple), showing structural understanding. However, growth-rate assumptions are thinly justified (only a single 4% figure mentioned, no clear rationale or higher short-term vs lower long-term staging), so treatment is correct but incomplete.",
