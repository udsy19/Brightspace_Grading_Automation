  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Ethan Mendonsa and\nthis is my\nthis is the comprehensive business\nevaluation uh uh assignment. So\nthe first thing that I did\nwas the the discover section. So the\nprompt that I used was to act as a\nsenior private equity associate uh and\nand gave it all the data\num that is in this essential deal\nsnapshot\nand it helps me to break down um break\ndown the KKR or the synergy rich\nintegration and so the first thing is\nthe KKR thesis. So obviously in this\nscenario we're buying a standalone asset\nso we cannot rely on external\nstrategies. IRRa is driven by EBIDA\ngrowth deleveraging and preparing the\nasset for premium rings at IPO as we can\nsee here. Next is the strategic thesis\nfor so for example McDonald's. So here\nthe buyer pays a premium because 1 plus\n1 equals three. The value comes from\nimmediate cost reductions and revenue\ncrosspollination.\nFor number three we have the KPIs to\nisolate in the model. So to quantify the\ndifference we need to create like a\ntoggle in our model that switches\nbetween these two cases essentially\nand here are the specific inputs.\nNext we have the management rollover\nimpact. So the rollover means existing\nmanagement is taking 10% of their\ncurrent equity value and reinvesting it\ninto new deal alongside KKR. and they\nare not cashing out that portion\nand this matters because it reduces the\namount of cash KR needs to wire at\nclosing. It aligns incentives but\nmathematically it serves as a source of\nfunds right\nand so the next step is the represent\nstage. So I need to design. So this is\nmy uh prompt and I prompted to help me\nto design a model to be dynamic enough\nto handle all the values.\nAnd so the first is the granularity fix\nthe Vantage analysis. So the main\nproblem it it tells me what the main\nproblem on my of my logic is and the fix\nis to use a RAM vector. Next is the\nmargin fix. So I'm hard coding my\nmargins at 15 to 17%. However, it's\nbetter to use to calculate margin as a\nweighted average of the two channels.\nAdditionally, it would be better to\nimprove the architecture of my Python\ncoding and it gives me an example of a\nmore robust class,\nright? As we can see from here. And so I\ndecide to\nessentially\nuh use the KISS principles and implement\nthe code based on my defined and\ndiscover stage as we can see here and\nthe represent stage\nand it gives me this code. So first is\nthe the final discover stage where we\nencapsulate all of the inputs as we can\nsee here the base parameters. Next is to\nrepresent the model. So first is the\nproject revenue and uh earnings before\nincome tax all that stuff. Next is to\nder derive the the free cash flow. So\nfor the simplification purposes, it's\nessentially EID minus taxes minus capex\nminus NWC changes\nand utilizes this formula essentially to\nmake it as simple as possible. Next we\nassume a 4% DNA\nuh and for number three we have the\ndiscounted cash flows as you can see\nhere. Number four is a terminal value\nwhich is the exit multiple method and\nnumber five is the sumification\nto return the enterprise value and the\nprojection.\nNext we can define we can see the\nscenarios that we had before in the\ndiscover stage. So in this it defines\nthe three different scenarios that we\nhave which is a downside base case and\nstrategic.\nNext is the step four is the market\nvalidation which consists of two steps\nwhich is trading coms which is P& based\nand proceeding transaction which is\nEBIDA based as we can see here. Finally\nwe have the visualization\nuh to so essentially prepares the data\nand then creates the visualizations and\nonce we execute all of the values we see\nthis. So here we can see the 5-year FCF\nthe base case 5-year FCF projection uh\nfor the DCF output and additionally we\nalso see the final valuation summary for\nthe Panera bread\nas you can see here it showcases\nthe recommended KQR bid which is 20.6 6\nbillion\nuh which is the final essentially it's\ngiving us the final answer for our\nprompting\nand so after all of this\nI ask it to based on based on all of the\nfindings to validate the code and it\nfound a few critical issues so the first\nerror was the assignment explicitly\nasked for five-year projections\nhowever I did find 10-year projections\nso it was a little overkill\nBut I just wanted to have a clearer\nunderstanding of the projected uh\nprojected goals and revenue and all of\nthat uh stuff.\nAdditionally,\num my chart is a bit wrong and\ndemonstrates a problem which I could fix\nin the future and it gives me ideas to\nfix. So using years of 10 instead of\nusing years of 10 to use years of five.\nUm and so yeah, next I ask it how I can\nevolve my code. So the first thing it\ntells me to do is use a sensitivity heat\nmap. So bankers never present a single\nnumber. They present a range of risks a\nheat map which I could have done instead\nof just showing the one answer, right?\nAnd it also gives me ideas on how to use\nthat in my DCF function. Next is to also\nuse a dynamic WCC calculation instead of\njust assuming that the WCC value is\n0.09. 09. Uh it is better to\nhave a sort of um\na number scale in order to easily be\nable to change that value depending on\nthe current state of the of the\nassignment. Right?\nAnd so in in reflection, I feel like\nthere are a lot of things that I could\nhave done better. I could have changed\nthis into a fiveyear. I could have had a\nbetter visualization in order to more\naccurately figure out the answer.\nuh as well as also change my code to be\nmuch more simpler and easier to\nunderstand as well as perhaps uh\nalso adding more strings in order to\nbetter uh visualize this to give more\ndescriptions to the visualizations and\nactually to give the reader an\nunderstanding a better understanding of\nwhat is actually occurring in this um inthis code. All right, thank you."
