  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly built and executed a DCF using free cash flow projections and a stated WACC (9.5%) to derive intrinsic values across scenarios, and validated the FCF and discount-rate choices. The use of scenario analysis, sensitivity testing, and explicit WACC/terminal-growth inputs demonstrates a thorough introductory treatment of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates an explicit forecast horizon (Year 5 revenue and margin targets) from a lower terminal growth rate (2.0%), and runs scenario/sensitivity tests around terminal growth. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding of multi‑stage growth reasoning consistent with the DRIVER stages, meriting a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected a relevant trading comparable (Chipotle) and cited a precedent EBITDA multiple range, then explicitly applied a 13.5× median multiple to LTM EBITDA to derive an EV benchmark and used multiples to justify the final bid. The treatment is specific and integrated across DRIVER stages, demonstrating thorough understanding appropriate for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student references a Base Case FCF projection and ran a DCF, but there is no discussion or breakdown of FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor any statement that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers. Because the required components and conceptual definition are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value via a stated terminal growth rate and reports DCF results, and they acknowledge terminal-growth sensitivity. However, treatment is brief—there is no detailed terminal value derivation or an explicit statement that TV comprises the majority of value—so the criterion is met correctly but only at a basic/partial level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports Enterprise Value benchmarks and recommended purchase prices (Implement and Reflect stages) but provides no explicit subtraction of Net Debt (or debt less cash) to derive Equity Value nor any division by share count to produce a Price Per Share. Therefore the EV→Equity→Per‑share bridge is missing.",
