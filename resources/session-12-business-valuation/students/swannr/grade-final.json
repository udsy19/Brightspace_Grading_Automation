  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines free cash flow construction, parameterizes the DCF inputs in code, and states a specific WACC (9%) used in the valuation, plus sensitivity to WACC—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of DCF mechanics consistent with the introductory criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value via a perpetual growth model with stated growth scenarios and WACC, parameterizes TV in their code, and presents sensitivity results showing TV/terminal growth materially drives enterprise value. Those elements demonstrate a thorough, conceptually sound treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast from a perpetual terminal and uses reasonable multi-stage growth assumptions (8% near-term vs. 3% terminal with upside/downside cases). Parameterization and sensitivity testing demonstrate a thorough, applied treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies EBITDA, cash taxes, CapEx, and working capital as FCF drivers and applies them in a DCF discounted by WACC, indicating understanding that FCFs feed enterprise value. However, they do not explicitly reference EBIT/NOPAT or the depreciation add-back (starting from EBITDA without clarifying tax/NOPAT adjustments), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise-value ranges and an equity valuation from a P/E, and shows modeling code, but never subtracts Net Debt (or otherwise bridges EV to Equity Value) nor divides Equity Value by share count to produce Price Per Share. Therefore the required criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external-style validation by triangulating DCF, comps, and precedents and provided sensitivity and risk discussion, demonstrating awareness of limitations (VALIDATE, REPRESENT, REFLECT). However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg/Capital IQ, specific datasets) as required for a full PASS, so the evidence meets the criterion only partially.",
