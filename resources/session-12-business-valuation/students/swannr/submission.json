  "transcript": "00:00 Hello, my name is Ryan Swan, and today I'm going to be going over Session 12's assignment. The core question is, what is the intrinsic and market-clearing valuation of Panera Bread, and how should companies, KKR approach a competitive auction with strategic bidders present?\n00:22 This requires spreading stand-alone value from synergy-driven value, and identifying where a disciplined financial buyer, should walk away. The Known Facts and Constraints.\n00:37 Panera generates approximately $6 billion in revenue, growing 8% annually, with $900 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, also known as EBITDA, representing a 15% margin and $400 million in net income across 2,100 stores.\n01:04 Digital sales already represent 50% of revenue, signaling a structurally improved business model rather than a secular spike. Industry reference points including trading P.E.\n01:22 multiples around 22 times. President EBITDA multiplies between 12 and 15 times, with strategic peers trading higher, Chipotle at 35 times P.E.\n01:36 and McDonalds at 25 times P.E. industry's weighted average cost of capital is approximately 9% and management intends to roll 10% of equity, aligning incentives with a private equity portfolio.\n01:52 And now for the buyer landscape. Strategic buyers such as Starbucks and McDonald's are circling. Their presence introduces synergy inflation risk, which is critical for a financial portfolio.\n02:08 With the problem defined, constraints identified, and market dynamics understood, I am now going to move on to the represent stage.\n02:24 I will triangulate the value using three lenses. Multi-scenario DCF for intrinsic value, trading Comparables for Public Market Reference, Precedent Trends, Transactions for Control Value.\n02:44 The DCF includes Base, Upside, and Downside cases driven by Store Expansion Success, Digital Mix Penetration, Margin Leverage, Terminal Growth, Outcome And then for our technology plan, all drives are automated in Python with assumptions parameterized for revenue growth, EBITDA margins, Capex, and \n03:09 working capital, weighted average cost of capital, and terminal growth. This allows real-time sensitive analysis during executive review. I'm going to begin with a five-year operating forecast, and for our revenue, revenue grows at 8% annually in the Bay Area.\n03:28 In Bay Area's case, supported by 500 new stores over five years, digital mix increasing from 50% to 70%, incremental diner and catering occasions, early-stage international contribution.\n03:49 For the margins, EBITDA margins expand modestly from 15% to 16.5% as digital scale improves. Labor efficiency and other order throughout.\n04:03 Cash flow construction. Free cash flow is calculated as EBITDA minus cash taxes minus maintenance and growth. Capex minus in-growth.\n04:16 Incremental working capital. This produces stable and growing free cash flows consistent with a mature, high-quality restaurant platform for the weighted average cost of capital and terminal value.\n04:32 I apply a 9% weighted average cost of capital consistent with industry norms for a scaled defensive consumer brand. Terminal value is calculated using a perpetual growth model with 3% growth.\n04:48 in the base case, 4% upside, and 2% downside. For DCF results, the DCF produces the following enterprise value ranges.\n05:01 Downside case approximately $9.5 billion. The base case with approximately $11.5 billion. And the upside case of approximately $13.5 billion.\n05:13 This establishes intrinsic value absent synergies. Trading Comparables. Next, I analyzed public comparables, applying the 22 times P.E.\n05:30 ratio to $400 million of net income and implied equity value of approximately $8.5 billion. Using EBITDA multiples in the 11 to 13 range, consistent with scaled restaurant peers, yielders, enterprise values between $9.9 billion and $11.5 billion.\n05:52 Proceeding transactions in the sector cluster between 12x and 15x EBITDA.\n06:02 Applying these multiples to Panera's MediRoute. 900 million EBITDA implies at the low end $10.8 billion while at the high end $13.5 billion.\n06:17 These represent control values inclusive of transaction premiums. Showing the code that I used to create all of this is right here.\n06:32 Pause if you want to stop and read to analyze what my code is doing. it is using simple Python code.\n06:40 To help us use it as a resource to break down Panera's analysis. Moving into our Validate stage. The football field synthesis across all of methods, DCF-based case centers around 11.5 billion.\n07:01 Comps cluster between $9.5 and $11.7 billion, and Presidents extend to 13.5 billion. The overlap zone between 1$1 and $12.5 billion represents the most defensible clearing range.\n07:17 Sensitivity analysis shows a 1% increase in weighted average cost of capital reduces value by 12%. And a 1% increase in terminal growth increases value by 15%.\n07:34 This confirms valuation sensitivity is driven more by long-term growth durability than short-term execution noise. Financial Buyer vs.\n07:48 Strategic Buyer Analysis Strategic buyers can justify $1 billion to $2 billion of incremental value  through supply chains.\n08:00 They can leverage store-overlap synergies, loyalty, and digital platform integration. However, these synergies introduce integration risk, execution uncertainty, and overpayment risk in competitors.\n08:16 KKR, as a financial buyer, should not underwrite strategic synergies, but instead rely on operational discipline, management rollover alignment, multiple expansion throughout executive operations.\n08:32 Execution. Based on validated outputs, i.e. evolve the strategy into an auctionable bid. Recommended bid strategy, KKR should target an entry valuation of $11.5 billion to $12.0 billion.\n08:48 Establish a hard walk-away price at $12.5 billion. Emphasize certainty of close, speed, and management continuity.\n09:01 Management's 10% rollover supports governance. Stability and reduces downside risk. And then, finally, moving into our last stage, the reflect, ah, stage.\n09:17 Reflecting on the analysis, the key insights in the Panera is a high-quality asset, but not a synergy-dependent one. Financial buyer discipline requires resisting strategic overreach and anchoring to intrinsic cash flow value.\n09:36 The driver framework ensured clear problem definition before modeling, transparent validation logic, evidence-based decision-making. In conclusion, Panera Bread is worth $11-12.5 billion on a statewide basis.\n09:52 KKR should bid competitively within this range, remain disciplined against strategic inflation, and walk away above $12.5 billion.\n10:08 Returns while preserving investment integrity. Thank you for listening."
