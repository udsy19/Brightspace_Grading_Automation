  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly lists key parameterized inputs and describes scenario cases (base/upside/downside and synergies). They also state the DCF is implemented in Python and works across scenarios, implying the model tolerates input changes. This satisfies the moderate standard for thorough conceptual treatment of parameterized inputs.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the valuation methods (DCF, trading comps/multiples, precedent transactions) and lists required assumptions/data (revenue growth, EBITDA margin, WACC, terminal growth, scenarios/synergies). Given the clear, stated methodology and required data elements, the criterion is fully met under the strict DRIVER standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic execution: they implemented a Python-based DCF with projections, scenario outputs, and valuation summaries, and presented validation outputs (FCF, WACC, comps). These elements meet the moderate-standard requirement for methodological implementation, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as discounted free cash flows and explicitly references WACC and terminal growth, and an implementation via Python, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However the treatment is brief and lacks quantitative detail or worked examples required for a thorough (PASS) demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes free cash flow in their DCF model and demonstrates implementation via the driver method and Python (Implementation stage), showing conceptual awareness. However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but basic—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value in their DCF implementation (mentions terminal value and terminal growth rate) and demonstrates it via the Implement/Discover stages, but they do not state or discuss that terminal value typically comprises the majority of enterprise value. Therefore the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
