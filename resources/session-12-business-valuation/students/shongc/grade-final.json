  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states DCF as discounting projected free cash flows to present value and explicitly uses WACC (9%) in the model, including a sensitivity test to 10%, demonstrating applied understanding and implications. The combination of conceptual description, implementation, and reflection supports a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student cites relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald’s) and industry multiples, and uses model outputs to state an implied ~13x EV/EBITDA tied to a specific bid range. With conceptual explanation, examples, and a clear application of a multiple to the subject company, this meets the introductory comparable methodology requirement at a thorough level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly compared DCF results to market/strategic multiples, ran scenario and WACC sensitivity tests, and justified a concrete bid range (11.5–12.5B) with rationale about strategic premiums and leverage risk. That combination of triangulation, sensitivity analysis, and a reasoned recommendation demonstrates thorough treatment and meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes projecting free cash flows and discounting by WACC (showing FCF used to derive enterprise value), and implemented this in code (IMPLEMENT). However, they do not explicitly identify key FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or show how those items are constructed from EBITDA, so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete. Therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates partial fulfillment by using market multiples and producing a 13x EBITDA benchmark (REFLECT) and by projecting/discounting five years of cash flow (IMPLEMENT). However, they do not explicitly show a terminal value calculation (growth or multiple) nor acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models a multi-year explicit forecast and uses reasonable short-term scenario growth rates (8%/12%/4%), satisfying part of the criterion. However, they do not state or justify a distinct, lower terminal growth rate or explicitly discuss the terminal period transition, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
