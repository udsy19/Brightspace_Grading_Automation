  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes DCF as a multi-year free cash flow projection and applies a discount rate (WACC ~9%) plus terminal growth, and produces a discounted EV result (9.39B). The IMPLEMENT evidence shows active calculation and use of code to compute FCF/EBITDA and apply the discounting methodology, meeting introductory DCF expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses a WACC (9%) as the DCF discount rate for enterprise cash flows and documents the inputs (risk-free rate, ERP, target D/E), showing a defensible, industry-framed WACC. The implementation evidence confirms the WACC was applied in their FCF/DCF calculation workflow.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected appropriate peers (Chipotle, Cava, McDonald's, Starbucks) and applied an EV/EBITDA multiple range with rationale, producing explicit implied enterprise value ranges. The DISCOVER framing plus IMPLEMENT evidence of calculation support a thorough, applied comparable methodology consistent with an introductory-level PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models and computes free cash flow over a 5-year bridge (Implement evidence) and embeds FCF in the DCF valuation (Discover evidence), demonstrating basic operational use. However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly includes a terminal value via a 2.5% Gordon growth assumption and mentions using an exit multiple (IMPLEMENT evidence), satisfying the calculation requirement. However, the student does not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically represents the majority of DCF value, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast and a terminal phase and provides reasonable short-term FCF growth (380 → 565) plus a terminal/discounting approach implemented in the model, so the core concepts are correct. However, justification for the chosen growth path and terminal assumptions is limited (no explicit CAGR, sensitivity/discussion of why 2.5%), so treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
