  "transcript": "This is our session 12 assignment. Um\nit's about comprehensive business\nvaluation.\nUh so the assignment over overview we're\nsupposed to deliver a full valuation of\nprera bread for a prospective KKR\ntakeover using driver which was combine\nDCF trading comps and precedent\ntransaction to produce an informed bid\nrange while contrasting financial buyer\ndiscipline with strategic buyer\nsynergies.\nSo this is our deal snapshot right here.\nis 50% margin 400 million net income\nacross 2100 stores digital sales already\n50%. Um the references uh the industry P\n22x the president\nmultiples 12 to 15x Chipotle trades at\n35x McDonald's at 25\nthe industry's whack 9% management wants\n10% rollover strategic biders u such as\nStarbucks are circling growth levers 500\nnew stores in five years digital mix is\n7% dinner and catering expansion early\nstage international rollout So, we're\nsupposed to create an executive ready\nrecommendation that states your\nvaluation range, winning bid strategy\nand rationale for choosing a financial\nversus strategic positioning.\nSo,\num versus the deal context. So, Preer\nBread occupies a fast casual premium\nspace balancing high quality bakery\nproducts with best-in-class digital\ninfrastructure. So our target profile is\nfun 100 units 900 million EB EBIC CDA\n400 million net income. The investment\nthesis is KKRC's a mature domestic asset\nwith underutilized growth levers 500\nstore unit expansion 70% digital mix\ntarget in international whites space uh\ncompeting with strategic giants such as\nStarbucks and McDonald's who can\nunderwrite synergies that KKR Panera as\na financial buyer cannot unless KKR\npositions Panera as a platform for\nfurther industry consolidation.\nSo our valuation plan we would\ntriangulate value using three method\nmethod methodologies\nsorry uh the discounted cash flow DCF uh\nprojects a 5-year FCF bridge with three\noperating scenarios trading comparables\nutilizing a pure set of fast casual like\nChipotle and Cava and global QSR\nMcDonald's and Starbucks uh president\ntransactions world view historical\nmultiples in the pennium sandwich bakery\nand casual dining segments Um so we'll\nimple implement value valuation\nexecution.\nUh so the multiple scenario for the\ndiscounted cash flow for the 5-year\nprojections if we assume an industry\nstandard whack of 9% and 2.5% terminal\ngrowth rate. Uh as you can see our\nprojections these are in millions.\nUh year one it's it's fully progresses\nfor the base. The upside goes up. It's\nnegative for the expansion and our free\ncash flow increases from 380 to 565\nmillion from year 1 to year five. So the\nWAC rational reflect a risk-free rate of\n4.2% an equity risk premium of 5.5% and\na target debt to equity ratio of 40 to\n60 post buyout. So calculated via Gordon\ngrowth at 11,000 well it would be 11300\nmillion 11.3 million\n10.2 to 11.8 8 million for the debt to\ncash flow.\nSo these are implementing Chipotle, Cava\nand then the big dogs such as McDonald's\nand Starbucks\nhow they're traded. So Chipotle has high\ngrowth digital benchmark. Cabba has high\ngrowth concept.\nUh McDonald's is global scale margin\nmaturity. Starbucks has afternoon day\npart beverage overlap. So\nwe apply 15 to 17 times EB high TDA\nmultiple reflecting a premium to\nstandard QSR but a discount to pure\ngrowth such as Kinola\nimpromp\nimplied expected value is 13.5 million\nor 15.75 million\nprecedent transactions the industry\naverages 12 to 15 times uh the notable\ncomparison uh Jab's original acquisition\nof Panera 2017 16 times or 7.5 billion.\nOur implied the implied EV was 10.8 to\n13.5 million.\nSo buyer perspective and synergies uh\nstrategic buyer position in McDonald's\nor Starbucks would underwrite 100\nmillion in annual synergies. Uh this\nallows them to pay 20 to 30% premium or\na financial buyer. Uh K position you\nmust rely on operational leverage. Uh\nrationale includes a management roll\nover 10%. Uh digital efficiency gains\nand aggressive unit expansion. KKR lacks\nhard synergies but offers speed,\ntransaction certainty and a commitment\nto a management's long-term uh growth\nvision. So evolve this the synthesis. Um\nthis is our our low expected value in\nbillions and our high expected value in\nbillion in billions and then our key\ndriver.\nSo as you can see right now our the bid\nrange for KKR is 12.5 billion lowest and\n14 billion for the highest. And the key\ndriver is a balance entry.\nSo for the winning bid strategy, we'll\nrecommend a price of 13.2 billion or\n14.6 times uh the EBITDA.\nUm the rationale, this price is\ncomfortably above precedent averages,\nbut sits below the current high-flying\npublic comps. Uh it provides enough\nvalue to ward off passive strategics\nwhile maintaining a disciplined IRR path\nfor KKR's LBO model. Uh the negotiation\ntalking point will highlight Paner's 50%\ndigital sales. a mix as a tech platform\nrather than a restaurant change to\njustify high teens multiple entry point\num financing will target a five times\nEBITDA leverage which will be equal to 4\nand a.5 billion in debt with 8.7 billion\nequity check which is inclusive of\ninclusive of management rollover then we\nput in our code\num used to calculate the EBI TDA and the\nFCF and the years including the whack\nand the exit multiple and we'll get 9.39\nbillion for the calculated DCF the\nenterprise value\nand then we'll put the Panera EVITDA and\nthe net income of 400 million um and the\nimplied ex expected value range for the\ncomps is 15.53 billion to 19.35 billion\nso we want to be in that range\nbut yeah in the end our recommendation\nprice is 13.2 two billion and uh\nwe need to make sure that we highlight\nPanera's 50% digital sales mix as a tech\nplatform instead of just a restaurant\nchain."
