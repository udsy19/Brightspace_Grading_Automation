  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models free cash flows, uses the Gordon Growth terminal value, and applies a WACC range to discount cash flows to present value, with scenario and sensitivity analysis. This demonstrates a thorough introductory DCF methodology consistent with the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements a terminal value via the Gordon Growth model with stated terminal growth and WACC inputs, and conducts sensitivity analysis highlighting how shifts in the terminal rate materially affect the DCF. Those elements demonstrate a clear understanding of terminal value calculation and its dominant influence on overall valuation, satisfying the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly separates a five-year explicit forecast from a terminal value and presents coherent base/upside/downside growth rates and margins. It also applies reasonable terminal growth sensitivity (2–4%) and WACC ranges, demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning and scenario analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly intends to calculate free cash flow and reports FCF and EBITDA outputs in the model (Represent and Implement), demonstrating correct conceptual use of FCF in valuation. However, they do not explicitly decompose FCF into EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, and working capital nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows awareness of the EV→Equity→Price-per-share workflow (reports EV and implied equity value ranges and discusses cash price per share), but it does not explicitly show the bridge calculation steps (subtracting net debt or debt less cash) nor an explicit division by share count to derive a price per share. This supports a partial (correct but incomplete) demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly creates at least two scenarios (base/upside/downside) and parameterizes WACC/terminal growth, and it discusses how changes (e.g., 1% terminal shift) affect valuation. However, it stops short of thorough numeric sensitivity outputs for each scenario/WACC combination (no detailed scenario-by-scenario valuation table), so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.",
