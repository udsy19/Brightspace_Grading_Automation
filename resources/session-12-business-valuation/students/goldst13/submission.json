  "transcript": "0:02\nHello everyone. Um my name is Abby\n0:04\nGoldstein and this is session assign uh\n0:07\nsession 12 assignment for management\n0:09\n310. Um and this code is essentially\n0:12\noutlining our comprehensive business\n0:14\nvaluation of Panera Bread um for a\n0:16\nprospective acquisition by KKR, a\n0:19\nfinancial buyer. Um our objective is to\n0:22\ndetermine a justifiable bid range and\n0:24\nrecommend a winning strategy that\n0:26\nbalances financial discipline with\n0:28\nmarket competitiveness. Um our analysis\n0:30\nis strictly guided by the driver\n0:32\nframework. Um so starting with define\n0:34\nand discover um our target is Panera\n0:37\nBread. The transaction is a potential\n0:39\nleverage buyout um LBO by KKR.\n0:43\nUm we are using the deal snapshot uh\n0:46\nsnapshot current so a current um 9 6.9\n0:51\num billion revenue uh 90 million EBITDA\n0:55\num a 9% industry whack um and market\n0:58\nmultiples so the price to earnings 22\n1:01\ntimes meaning the company's current\n1:03\nstock price is 22 times its annual\n1:05\nearnings per share um president EBITDA\n1:08\num 12 times to 14 times meaning the\n1:10\ntotal purchase price ranged from 12 to\n1:13\n15 times the target company's annual um\n1:16\nEBITDA.\n1:18\nUm the conflict is that we must contrast\n1:21\nthe disciplined approach of a financial\n1:23\nbuyer like KKR versus the potential of a\n1:26\nstrategic buyer like Starbucks or\n1:28\nMcDonald's. So we have our code\n1:30\nparameters like current revenue at six\n1:33\num yeah current revenue the revenue uh\n1:37\nCAGR uh the EV uh ITDA mar uh margin\n1:42\ntarget um the whack terminal growth rate\n1:45\num that all helped us build our code.\n1:48\nSo the represent stage involved building\n1:51\na valuation architecture that\n1:53\nencapsulates all three valuation\n1:55\nmethods. Um by parameterizing drivers\n1:58\nlike growth rate and margins, we can\n2:00\nquickly toggle between the scenarios. So\n2:02\nI've ran the code. We're going to start\n2:06\nwith\n2:07\nour discounted cash flow.\n2:10\nSo we started with our discounted cash\n2:13\nflows. uh the discounted cash flow\n2:15\nmethod um which calculates Panera's\n2:17\nintrinsic value based on its projected\n2:19\nfree cash flow.\n2:22\nSo our assumptions are that our base\n2:24\nscenario assumes the a 7.5% revenue uh\n2:27\nCAGR and a target EBITDA margin of\n2:31\n16.5%.\n2:32\nUm and we use the assigned 9% whack. Um\n2:36\nthe model generates 5 years of cash\n2:38\nflows leading to B leading to a base\n2:40\nenterprise value of 10.86 863 billion.\n2:44\nUm we quantify potential cost revenue\n2:47\nSyringes at 1.533 billion. Um which\n2:51\nraises the strategic buyer potential\n2:53\nvalue to 12.396\n2:56\nbillion.\n2:59\nSo in the implement phase um we're\n3:01\nlooking at this\n3:04\num we triangulate the discounted cash\n3:06\nflow result using market based meth\n3:08\nmethods. Um so trading comps the um\n3:11\napplying a conservative 11.0x\n3:14\nebitda multiple uh um gives us a\n3:17\nstarting value of 9.9 billion.\n3:21\nPresident transactions um the range of\n3:23\nhistorical de uh deal multiples suggest\n3:26\na value between 10.8 billion to 13.5\n3:30\nbillion.\n3:32\nUm, and this confirms a ride range uh\n3:34\nnecessitating for the next step uh\n3:36\nnecessitating the next step for\n3:38\nvalidation. So, we're going to go down\n3:40\nto our sensitivity analysis. Um, in the\n3:44\nvalidate stage, we stress um test our\n3:47\ncore assumptions using a sensitivity\n3:48\nanalysis. Um, the problem was that our\n3:51\nbase discounted cash flow value of\n3:54\n10.863\n3:56\nmillion um is highly reliant on the 9%\n4:00\nwhack. um and the 2% terminal growth. Um\n4:04\nso we ran sensitivities on the whack and\n4:06\nthe terminal growth. Um and so the\n4:09\nvaluation is highly sensitive. For\n4:10\nexample, if the whack is lower at 8%. Um\n4:14\nand the growth is higher at uh 3% the\n4:16\nvalue jumps to 12.292\n4:19\nbillion or sorry the the whack is low at\n4:24\n9%.\n4:25\nLet's see right here. Conversely, poor\n4:28\nperformance could drop the value uh\n4:30\nbelow 9 billion.\n4:32\nUm this analysis confirms that the base\n4:35\num EV of 10.863 billion is plausible but\n4:39\nrequires the success of uh growth\n4:41\nlevers. Um the model is stable but the\n4:43\nassumptions carry risk.\n4:46\nSo finally we enter our reflect stage to\n4:50\nsynthesize our findings into an\n4:52\nexecutive ready recommendation for KKR.\n4:55\nUm after calculating the enterprise\n4:58\nvalue across all scenarios and\n4:59\nsubtracting the assumed 50 u 500 million\n5:03\nuh million net debt um we arrive at an\n5:05\nequity range of 9.4 billion to 13\n5:10\nbillion\n5:12\num or 94 to $130 um per share just\n5:18\nstated right here. Um we recommend a\n5:21\nwinning bid of 10.624 billion total\n5:23\nequity um or $16.24\n5:28\nper share. Um the bid is a strategic b\n5:32\nuh strategic position based on the\n5:34\nfollowing rationale. So the bid strategy\n5:37\num KKR uh bid bid near the uh standalone\n5:42\ninterest in interest in interest in\n5:42\ninterest in interest in interest in\n5:42\ninterest in interest in interest in\n5:42\ninterest in interest in interestic value\n5:43\nof 10.624 billion. Um the strategic\n5:47\nbuyers at the seal uh ceiling leveraging\n5:49\nthe quantifiable syringes of the 12.396\n5:52\nbillion.\n5:54\nSo KKR's position um our recommend our\n5:57\nrecommended bid is deliberately\n5:59\npositioned just below the uh standalone\n6:01\nuh discounted cash flow value. Um it\n6:04\nacts as a control premium um over the\n6:06\nmarket but contains but maintains\n6:08\nfinancial uh discipline. Um KKR avoids\n6:12\noverpaying for the full syringe value\n6:14\nthat cannot be realized.\n6:16\nAnd then our capital structure, the 10%\n6:19\nmanagement rollover aligns um rollover\n6:22\naligns incentives and reduces the KKR's\n6:24\ninitial equity check. Um strategic um\n6:27\nbiders benefit from the low cost of\n6:29\ncapital potentially giving them a\n6:31\npersistent advantage.\n6:33\nUm so our final recommendation is to bid\n6:36\nat the 10 uh 6 10.624 billion. Um, this\n6:41\nis a disciplined offer that compels\n6:42\nstrategic bidders to reveal their hand\n6:45\num while providing a clear walkway price\n6:48\nof 9.4 billion if the required execution\n6:51\nrisk is not appropriately priced. And\n6:54\nthis was my session 12 assignment. Um,\n6:58so thank you so much for watching."
