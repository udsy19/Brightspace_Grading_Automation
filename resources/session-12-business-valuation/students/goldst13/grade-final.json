  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines DCF as valuing projected free cash flows and explicitly applies a discount rate (the 9% \"whack\") to generate present-value enterprise value, plus runs sensitivity analysis on WACC and terminal growth. They provide assumptions (5-year cash flows, growth and margin inputs) and interpret results, demonstrating thorough introductory-level mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (5 years) and a terminal period with an explicit terminal growth (2%), and uses a reasonable short‑term revenue CAGR (7.5%) versus a lower long‑term terminal growth. They also perform sensitivity analysis illustrating impacts of changing WACC/terminal growth, demonstrating thorough, applied multi‑stage growth reasoning.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used a 9% WACC as the discount rate in the DCF for FCFF and stated it as an industry/assigned rate, and they performed sensitivity analysis showing how changes in WACC materially affect enterprise value. These demonstrate correct application and a defensible WACC choice with applied analysis, satisfying PASS under the moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses a DCF based on projected free cash flows and translates enterprise value to equity (EV minus net debt), showing basic grasp that cash-flow valuation ties to value for capital providers. However, they do not enumerate or discuss FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor explicitly state FCF represents cash available to all providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a terminal-growth assumption in the DCF and runs sensitivities on terminal growth/WACC, showing awareness that terminal assumptions materially affect value. However, they do not present an explicit terminal value calculation or quantify the TV's share of total value—so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes subtracting net debt from EV to obtain Equity Value and reports per‑share prices, showing conceptual understanding. Treatment is brief and a bit unclear on the exact net‑debt figure and the explicit division by share count, so the work is correct but not thoroughly documented — therefore PARTIAL.",
