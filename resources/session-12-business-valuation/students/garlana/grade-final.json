  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present value of future free cash flows, implements it in code (including FCF formula and Gordon terminal value), and applies a 9% WACC to discount cash flows with sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding at the introductory level, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements a terminal value using the Gordon growth formula with stated inputs (g=3%, WACC=9%) and documents it in code (IMPLEMENT). They also acknowledge that the TV comprises ~80% of total DCF (REFLECT), demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year forecast and a terminal period, uses a higher short-term base-case growth (8%) with an explicit lower terminal growth (3%), and tests an upside (12%) plus WACC sensitivity. They demonstrate depth by quantifying the terminal's share (~80%) and running scenario analyses, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models a simplified free cash flow (EBITDA*(1–tax) less capex) and implemented it in code, showing conceptual understanding of taxes and maintenance capex. However, they omitted explicit mention of other core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT vs EBITDA, depreciation/non-cash adjustments, and working capital) and did not explicitly state that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports and discusses enterprise value outputs and bid amounts but does not show subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value nor dividing any equity value by share count to obtain price per share. Because both required steps of the EV→Equity bridge are missing from the transcript, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the valuation object (Panera) and the acquisition context and explicitly identifies KKR/financial buyer as a stakeholder. However, the submission does not explicitly identify \"Management\" as a stakeholder, so it fails to fully meet the criterion requiring both KKR and Management to be named.",
