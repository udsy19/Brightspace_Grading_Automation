  "transcript": "0:02\nHello, my name is Alexander Garland and\n0:04\nI'm going to walk you through my\n0:06\nevaluation of Panera Bread for a\n0:09\npotential KKR takeover. And I used the\n0:12\ndriver method to structure this\n0:13\nanalysis. So, first for define and\n0:16\ndiscover, the goal here is to figure out\n0:18\nwhat Panera um is worth to us as a\n0:21\nfinancial buyer versus what it might be\n0:24\nworth to a strategic buyer like\n0:26\nMcDonald's. And the background is that\n0:28\nPanera is generating $6 billion in\n0:30\nrevenue with a healthy 15% EBITDA\n0:34\nmargin, but we have a a few constraints.\n0:39\nSo the interest rates are real. So our\n0:41\nWACC is 9%. And we're looking at\n0:45\nindustry um P/E of around 22x. So the\n0:51\nquestion I want to explore is\n0:55\num can we afford to bid competitively\n0:57\nagainst strategic giants without\n0:59\noverpaying. So now moving on to the\n1:02\nrepresent I um wanted to map out a plan\n1:06\nand um I knew I needed a DCF to find the\n1:09\nintrinsic value which is basically just\n1:11\ncalculating the time value of money for\n1:14\nPanera's future cash flows. But I also\n1:16\nneeded to look at the market reality. So\n1:19\nI planned a what if analysis using\n1:22\nmultiple or using market multiples from\n1:24\nChipotle and recent deals.\n1:33\nAnd then now for the implementation\n1:38\num I built a Python model to automate\n1:40\nthe heavy lifting and I inputed our $6\n1:43\nbillion revenue and assumed a 9% WACC.\n1:48\nSo going to our Python code\n1:53\nthis is it here. Um so looking at the\n1:56\nheart of the analysis which is the DCF\n1:58\nfunction. This function uses the time\n2:01\nvalue of money principle to find the\n2:02\npresent value of Panera's future cash\n2:05\nflows. And our projection is that first\n2:08\nthe um code projects revenue and EBITDA\n2:11\nfor 5 years. And we take the 900 $900\n2:14\nmillion EBITDA and then apply the growth\n2:18\nweight rates which are 8% in the base\n2:20\ncase and the margin assumptions for each\n2:23\nscenario. And for free cash flow which\n2:26\nis also just FCF this is the DCF\n2:29\nfunction shown here and then the free\n2:31\ncash flow calculation is also shown in\n2:34\nhere. So for the free cash flow the FCF\n2:37\ncalculation uses simplification for\n2:40\nspeed. So FCF equals EBITDA time 1 minus\n2:44\ntax rate and then this is all subtracted\n2:46\nfrom the revenue times the Capex percent.\n2:51\nAnd this gives us the cash um the\n2:53\nbusiness generates after taxes and\n2:55\nnecessary maintenance capital\n2:56\nexpenditures.\n2:58\nAnd then for the terminal value\n3:04\num shown here\n3:06\nwe the this code calculates the value of\n3:09\nPanera beyond year five using the Gordon\n3:12\ngrowth model. And this is where the\n3:13\nlong-term assumption of 3% \n3:16\nperpetuity growth is critical. And the\n3:19\nformula is um TV equals FCF of year 5 *\n3:23\n1 plus the growth rate over WACC minus\n3:26\nthe growth. And g is the 3% terminal\n3:30\ngrowth rate and WACC is 9%.\n3:34\nThis single TV number represents about\n3:36\n80% of our total DCF value underscoring\n3:39\nthe importance of those long-term\n3:41\nassumptions. And then for discounting\n3:45\num shown here. So finally the code takes\n3:47\nthe 5 years of FCS plus the large\n3:50\nterminal value and discounts them all\n3:52\nback to today at the 9% WACC.\n3:56\nAnd um to show\n4:00\nthis\n4:02\nchart that we received after running the\n4:04\ncode, here it is. Here we have the\n4:05\nPanera Bread valuation range which is\n4:08\nbasically shown on the football field,\n4:09\nthe enterprise value in millions of\n4:11\ndollars and then the different DCF um\n4:14\nprecedent and trading comps. And this is\n4:17\nthe output from running those functions.\n4:19\nWe see that\n4:21\nthe base case DCF the which is the\n4:24\npurple bar up here um valued Panera at\n4:26\nroughly $8 billion um specifically $7.97\n4:30\nbillion and this is the intrinsic value\n4:33\nderived directly from the discounted\n4:35\ncash flows and then looking at the green\n4:38\nbars which are the president\n4:39\ntransactions um based on recent deals\n4:42\ntrading at 12 to 15 times EBIT TVA um\n4:46\nthe market value is sitting\n4:47\nsignificantly higher between $10.8\n4:50\nbillion and $13.5 billion. So this\n4:53\ndifference is what we have to resolve in\n4:55\nour final recommendation.\n4:58\nAnd then\n5:02\num to validate this in Python we have\n5:06\nthe sensitivity analysis. So I made a\n5:08\nsensitivity analysis to stress test my\n5:10\nmodel. You can see the text um output\n5:13\nbelow the chart. I wanted to ask what if\n5:16\ninterest rates rise and our cost of\n5:17\ncapital ends up going up and so if WHCC\n5:20\nincreases to 10% our base validation\n5:22\ndrops from $8 billion to $6.45 billion\n5:27\nand this is a major risk because it\n5:28\nshows that at $8 billion we are already\n5:31\npricing this perfectly and any interest\n5:33\nrate hike really destroys our equity\n5:35\nvalue. So I also calculated a strategic\n5:38\nsynergy premium. So, if a buyer like\n5:41\nStarbucks can save just 10% in cost,\n5:43\nthat adds about $800 million to the\n5:46\nvalue immediately, which explains why\n5:48\nstrategic buyers can bid higher than us.\n5:51\nAnd so, this is shown in the sensitivity\n5:53\nright here.\n5:56\nAnd looking at the evolve and reflect.\n5:59\nSo, evolving to thinking to the bid\n6:01\nstrategy. So our conflict is that our\n6:03\nDCF says the business is worth $8\n6:06\nbillion, but the market residents say\n6:08\nsellers expect 11 billion to $13.5\n6:12\nbillion. And so if we are um KKR, which\n6:15\nis a financial buyer, we have to be\n6:17\ndisciplined and we cannot pay $13.5\n6:20\nbillion based on the base case cash\n6:23\nflows. We would lose um out on money.\n6:26\nHowever, looking at the DCF upside bar,\n6:28\nwhich is the blue bar in the middle,\n6:33\num if we believe the digital rollout can\n6:35\ndrive growth to 12%.\n6:38\nThen, um the valuation catches up to\n6:41\nthat 11 billion range. And so, my\n6:43\nrecommendation is that we should open a\n6:45\ndisciplined bid around $ 8.8 $8 billion\n6:48\nwhich is matching the trading comps and\n6:50\nwe can stretch to $10.5 billion only if\n6:53\nwe are confident in the upside\n6:54\noperational improvements. If the bidding\n6:58\nwar goes toward the president high of\n7:00\n$13.5 billion then we must walk away\n7:03\nbecause that is a price only a strategic\n7:05\nbuyer with massive synergies can\n7:07\njustify. And finally for the reflect we\n7:10\num what surprised me I was surprised by\n7:12\nthe gap between intrinsic value of $8\n7:14\nbillion and market value of $1 13\n7:16\nbillion. And it taught me that right now\n7:19\nthe market is pricing in perfection or\n7:21\nmassive strategic premiums. And as a\n7:23\nfinancial buyer using the driver method\n7:25\nand framework seeing this gap\n7:27\nquantitatively saved me from\n7:29\nrecommending a potential disastrous $13\n7:31\nbillion bid.\n7:34\nAnd it's also um I didn't expect the\n7:37\ndigital mix currently 50% to be such a\n7:40\nhuge lever um in the upside like Python\n7:43\nscenario even a small margin expansion\n7:45\nfrom digital efficiencies created\n7:46\nbillions in extra value and it taught me\n7:49\nthat um for modern restaurants\n7:51\ntechnology is just important as the food\n7:54\nand this overall concludes my driver\n7:56analysis. So thank you."
