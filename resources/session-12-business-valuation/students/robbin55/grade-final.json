You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the chosen valuation methods (DCF and comps/precedent transactions) and supplies key quantitative assumptions (WACC 9%, terminal growth 2.5%, revenue and growth figures). Those explicit method selections and assumptions meet the Represent: Methodology Selection requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invokes DCF and specifies a discount rate (WACC = 9%) and terminal growth, showing basic understanding of discounting future value. However, they do not explicitly describe DCF as the present value of future free cash flows nor provide detailed application or supporting calculations, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission references DCF and the Driver framework but contains no mention or explanation of FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor the concept that FCF is cash available to providers of capital. Given the absence of these required elements despite using valuation stages, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows conceptual awareness by specifying a terminal growth rate and WACC (Implement) but does not present an explicit terminal value calculation nor acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value. Therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",
