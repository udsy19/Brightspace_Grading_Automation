  "transcript": "0:02\nHello. Today I'm going to be doing my\n0:04\nsession 12 assignment\n0:07\nand this is the Panera evaluation.\n0:10\nWhen I first step is to find and\n0:12\ndiscover. When I started this valuation,\n0:13\nmy goal was simple. Figure out what KKR\n0:16\nshould realistically bid for Panera\n0:18\nBread and understand how that number\n0:19\nchanges if a strategic buyer like\n0:22\nStarbucks or McDonald's steps in. So, I\n0:24\npulled together the key facts. Panera\n0:26\nmakes about 900 million in EBITDA\n0:29\nand 400 million in net income. They have\n0:32\n2,100 stores, strong digital, already\n0:35\n50% of sales, and room to grow. Industry\n0:38\nP& is around 22x percent deals go for 10\n0:43\nto 15x EBITA and comps like Chipotle and\n0:47\nMcDonald's trade at 35x and 25x.\n0:52\nWACC for the industry is about 9%.\n0:55\nAnd manage management would keep 10% in\n0:58\nthe deal. Strategics hovering around the\n1:01\nprocess could justify more because of\n1:03\nsynergies. I also listed Panera's main\n1:06\ngrowth levelers\n1:08\nlevers, new store openings, higher\n1:11\ndigital mix, better dining/catering\n1:13\npenetration, and the early international\n1:15\nopportunity. Define and discover for me\n1:18\nwas getting clear on the problem. What\n1:21\nis Panera Bread worth today? What could\n1:23\nit be worth in the future? And what\n1:24\nshould a private equity buyer versus\n1:26\nstrategic buyer pay for it? Represent.\n1:29\nNext, before touching any code, I plan\n1:31\nmy route, basically outlining the entire\n1:33\nvaluation process. So, I decided to\n1:36\nbuild three valuation pillars. One, DCF\n1:39\nbase, upside, and downside cases. Two,\n1:42\ntrading comps using industry PE PEN\n1:46\ncomps like Chipotle and McDonald's. and\n1:48\nproceeded transactions recent EBIT TDA\n1:52\nmultiples in the sector then I would\n1:55\nbuild everything in Python with all\n1:56\nassumptions parameterized project\n1:59\nPanera's 5-year opening model revenue\n2:02\nmargins free cash flow calculate\n2:04\nenterprise values under each scenario\n2:07\nlayer in strategic synergies\n2:10\nrun a sensitivity on WACCC and terminal\n2:13\ngrowth and finish with a football field\n2:16\nchart combining all the valuation\n2:18\nmethods. This gave me a clear plan so\n2:20\nthe analysis stayed organized. In\n2:23\nimplement I coded the full model in\n2:25\nPython. I started with the three\n2:27\noperating scenarios. Base case steady\n2:30\ngrowth rate and digital mix expansion\n2:33\nupside higher digital margins and faster\n2:35\nstore ramp. Downside slower expansion\n2:38\nand margin pressure. For each scenario,\n2:41\nthe model calculates revenue EBIT and\n2:45\nEBITDA\n2:46\nworking capital capex free cash flow\n2:49\nterminal value using both a growth\n2:52\nmethod and an exit multiple. Then I\n2:54\ndiscounted everything using a 9% WACC.\n2:57\nI also built trading comps using 22X\n3:00\nindustry PE, 35X Chipotle, 25X\n3:04\nMcDonald's, and president deals using 12\n3:07\nto 15 EBITDA.\n3:09\nA synergy opt option showing how much\n3:13\nmore value a strategic can justify about\n3:16\n10 to 15%. At the end, the model outputs\n3:19\nthree DC values, a trading comp range, a\n3:22\npresident transaction range, a synergy\n3:24\nadjusted range, and a football field\n3:26\nchart that visually ties it all\n3:28\ntogether. So, as you can see here,\n3:31\nall the code was entered in. And as we\n3:34\ngo to the bottom, we get our output\n3:36\nhere, which is just giving us all of our\n3:38\ndata. And then that football field graph\n3:42\nright or chart. Validate. Invalidate. I\n3:45\nchecked whether the numbers actually\n3:46\nmade sense. I sanity checked. Revenue\n3:49\ngrowth and margins. Are they realistic\n3:50\nfor Panera? Terminal value. Does it\n3:53\nexplode unrealistically when WACC\n3:56\nchanges? Implied multiples. Do they line\n3:58\nup with comps and precedented deals?\n4:01\nupside case. Does the digital scale\n4:03\nsupport the margin boost I assumed? Then\n4:06\nI ran the WACC and terminal growth\n4:08\nsensitivity table. When small changes in\n4:10\nassumption didn't break the model or\n4:12\nproduce crazy valuations, that gave me\n4:14\nthe confidence that the valuation was\n4:16\ngrounded. Evolved. Once the numbers were\n4:19\nsolid, I refined the story. Originally,\n4:21\nthe base DCF was giving me a value of\n4:23\naround 10 to 11 billion with upside of\n4:26\n13 to 14 billion. President deals and\n4:29\ncomp supported that range. Then I\n4:32\nlayered in strategic synergies, things\n4:34\nlike digital infrastructure overlap,\n4:37\nbetter purchasing power, share delivery\n4:39\noperations, international expansion\n4:41\nmuscle. With those strategies could\n4:43\njustify 14 to 16 billion easily. So I\n4:47\nevolved the simple valuation into a full\n4:50\nbidding strategy, not just a price.\n4:54\nReflect. My final recommendation. My\n4:56\nfinal recommendation is for KKR the\n4:58\nfinancial buyer the bid range from 11.5\n5:01\nbillion to 12 billion walk away is 12.5\n5:06\nbillion this keeps returns attractive\n5:08\nand stays disciplined for a strategic\n5:11\nbuyer like Starbucks or McDonald's they\n5:13\ncan justify 14 to 16 billion because\n5:16\nsynergies meaningfully improve cash\n5:18\nflows and margins and why I chose this\n5:21\nfinancial buyers can't unwrite synergy\n5:23\nthe way stratei strategies\n5:26\nCan strategics can so KKR needs\n5:29\ndiscipline. Pay for what Panera can do\n5:30\non its own, not what strategic can\n5:32\nunlock. What I learned this didn't feel\n5:35\nlike a class assignment. It felt like an\n5:37\nactual deal. I had to balance numbers\n5:39\nwith judgment, uncertainty, and\n5:41\nstrategy. Driver kept me organized,\n5:44\nespecially at the beginning when the\n5:45\nproject felt overwhelming. By the end, I\n5:47\nhad a full valuation and clear\n5:49\ndefensible bid recommendations.\n5:52\nThank you for watching and I hope you\n5:53\nhave a great rest of your day"
