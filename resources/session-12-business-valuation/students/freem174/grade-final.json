  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly builds free cash flows, computes terminal value, and discounts cash flows using a stated WACC (9%), and applies sensitivities and multiple scenarios—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of DCF methodology consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used WACC (9%) as the discount rate in the DCF and justified it as an industry value. They also validated that choice via sensitivity testing, demonstrating both correct application and a defensible WACC—meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, industry PE) and stated Panera's EBITDA/net income, then implemented those multiples (PE and EV/EBITDA ranges) in the model to produce trading and precedent value ranges. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages provide clear evidence of correct and applied comparable methodology at an introductory, thorough level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly lists and models key FCF inputs (EBIT/EBITDA, working capital, and CapEx) and uses discounted FCF to derive enterprise value, indicating an understanding that FCF drives value to capital providers. However, the submission lacks explicit discussion of NOPAT and depreciation adjustments (or explicit linkage of EBITDA→EBIT→NOPAT), so the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations by both methods and demonstrates awareness of TV sensitivity (checking for it “exploding” and running sensitivity tables). However, they do not explicitly state that terminal value typically represents the majority of a DCF value; that point is only implied via sensitivity concerns. Therefore the treatment is correct but not fully explicit or thorough, yielding a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast and uses terminal-value methods (growth method and exit multiple) with sensitivity testing, showing correct conceptual multi-stage reasoning. However, they do not present specific terminal growth rates or explicit numeric links showing short-term > long-term growth assumptions, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a full PASS.",
