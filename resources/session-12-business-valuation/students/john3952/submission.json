  "transcript": "Hi everyone. Today I'm presenting a\ncomprehensive valuation and analysis of\nPanera Bread for a perspective KKR\ntakeover. So this analysis is going to\nfollow the driver framework like every\nother analysis and session assignment\nwe've done thus far in the semester. And\nit combines three valuation\nmethodologies. a DCF analysis, trading\ncomparables and precedent transactions\nto arrive at a recommendation fit\nstrategy and additional key insights.\nSo for starting off with D, so I\nstructured like I mentioned, I\nstructured my entire analysis using the\ndriver framework and so I wanted to\nrepresent this and I did so through um\nmy website here um starting first with\ndefine and discover. So KKR needs to\ndetermine Panera's fair value and\noptimal bid strategy. And so that's our\ncore problem that we're trying to solve.\nSo I identified key questions here that\nare going to help structure our\nanalysis. So they're as follows. Is\nPanera worth on a standalone basis? How\ndoes market value companies um compare?\nAnd what similar companies have sold for\num and what are those numbers there? And\nthen what synergies could strategic\nbuyers capture and what is the optimal\nbid to win without overpaying?\nSo\nas we were given in the assignment the\nstatistics that are relevant to making\nthese decisions are as follows. So the\nkey data points that I have are current\nfinancial sewing $6 billion in revenue\nand 900 900 million EIDA\num IBIDA and then 2100 stores with a 50%\ndigital penetration rate and growth\nplans to add 500 new additional stores\nbring that number up to 2600 and an\nindustry benchmark so that the price per\nearnings multiples are around 22% for\nthe um median for the industry. Um in um\nIBIDA mult multiples are of 12 to 15\ntimes\nand comparable companies like Chipotle\nare trading at 35 times their price per\nearnings and McDonald's at 35 times\ntheir price per earnings. So this\ndiscovery phase is really critical to\nhelping establish all assumptions that\nwe have for building any models.\nSo next moving on to represent.\nSo like I mentioned earlier we have\nthree a three-prong valuation strategy\nto capture intrinsic value trading\ncomparables to see how the public market\num values similar businesses and\npresidential transactions to understand\nwhat acquirers have actually paid in the\npast. And I plan to synthesize these\nusing a football field chart and to\ntriangulate\num to a final recommendation considering\nboth financial and strategic buyer\nperspectives using all three of our\nevaluation strategies.\nNow on to implement. So as I'll show you\nin a moment here, I visualized all this\nand ran through the analyses for each\nstage of my threepronged valuation\nbasis. And um I'll show you those in a\nminute. And then on to validate. So to\nmake sure that everything was accurate,\nvalidation is crucial. And so I checked\nthat the terminal range the terminal\nvalue represents 60 to 80% of DCF value,\nwhich is very reasonable and a good\ntarget number to be at. Um and then I\nverified that um implied exit multiples\nalign with comparable companies. I also\nconfirmed that control premiums in\nprecedent transactions are consistent\nwith market norms of 25 to 35%\nroundabout and I ensured that peer\nselection was justified based on\nbusiness model market share growth scale\nand additional metrics of their profile\nand then moving on to evolve.\nSo there I made several versions of this\nworking uh website mostly to debug um\nthese versions and also to add this\nhomepage where I can fully represent\ndriver and the driver framework and in\nwhat stage and how I used it. Um and so\nit was very important for me to evolve\nthis tool. Um but I adjusted the WCC\nsensitivity for current interest rates\nto make sure that could be the most\naccurate. Um and then finally for\nreflect we'll get into that later but\nvaluation really is a range it's not a\nsingle point right so different methods\nyield different results and the art is\nin triangulation acrewing as much\nsources for valuation as possible and\nnot getting a single number or a single\nvaluation range that doesn't really\nrepresent the full story of the\ncompany's valuation and um true method\nof valuation\nSo let me show you the detailed modules.\nSays DCF as it implies is our discounted\ncash flow analysis. And um it values\nPanera based on its future cash flows\ndiscounted to present value. And so I\nbuilt three scenarios. The downside base\nupside. And we're going to start with\nthe base upside. We're assuming an 8%\nannual revenue growth. Um and that\nreflects the 500 new additional stores\nplus um modest store sales growth. As I\nmentioned, this is the base projection.\nAnd so, looking at our projections\ntable, this is a pretty good look at\nwhat we can expect. Seeing revenue grow\nfrom 6 billion today to over 8.8 billion\num to uh by year five, which is really\ngreat. So, I scales proportionately as\nwell. Also maintaining that 15% margin\nas we saw earlier in our discovery phase\nafter accounting for taxes and capital\nexpenditures for new stores and working\ncapital needs free cash flows um from\nabout 630 million in year 1 to over 930\nmillion in year five.\nSo um\nyou guys can see all this.\nSo the present value of these five cash\nflows um is approximately\num three bit 3.3 billion um but the\nmajority of value about 70% of it comes\nfrom the terminal value which assumes\nthat um Panera continues to grow at that\n3% rate perpetually and the terminal\nvalues present value is 7.7 billion and\nso adding these together gives us an\nenterprise value of approximately\n11 billion in the base case which\nimplies\nan EV multiple of about 12.2% right in\nthe middle of our benchmark range. And\nso let me demonstrate the model\nsensitivity. I adjust this to 10% or\nweighted average cost of capital. You\ncan see that there's some things that\nchange right off the bat. So value drops\nto about 10.1 million. And this shows\nhow sensitive the DCF discount rate can\nbe. Um, and now we're going to toggle\nover to the upside case.\nUm, and so on the upside case, um, let's\nlook at a scenario with a 12% growth. Um\nnow you know maybe\naccelerates digital expansion or succeed\nfaster um with dinner day part and\nenterprising values increases to over\n12.7 billion. Um and then finally going\nover the downside scenario and that we\nonly see 4% growth and maybe competition\nbecame more stiff um or\nmarket saturation increase and we\nroughly only get 9.9\nbillion. Um, let me make sure I can\ndemonstrate this fully because I don't\nknow it updated on. There we go.\nDownside.\nUhhuh.\nOkay.\nLet's change this.\nYep. As you can see.\nAll right. So\nnow I want you to see, let's see,\nI want you to see this free cash flow\nprojection graph that I have here. Um,\nand this chart visualizes how free cash\nflows grow over time and shows the\npresent value of each year's cash flow.\nAnd so notice how later years contribute\nless than present value terms due to\ndiscounting. And that's why the\nweightage average cost of capital\nmatters a lot. So the DCF suggests that\nPanera is worth 9.5 billion um worth\nbetween sorry 9.5 billion to 12.7\nbillion depending on the growth\nscenarios that I've talked about here\ntoday. And so with a base case of 11\nbillion and so let's see how the market\nvalues similar companies with the\ntrading comparables analysis\num Chipotle represents a high growth\npremium flash casual segment and they\ntrade at 35 times their price or\nearnings sorry\nand um\nand this reflects their exceptional unit\neconomics and their brain strength and\num McDonald's is at a 25 PP and 16%\nIBIDA\nEIDA which represents the large scale\noperations that they have and the global\npresence that they have. Starbucks is at\na 25 times P fe PE and a 18 times Ebida.\nAnd they offer another premium brand\ncomparison with strong digital\ncapabilities and the average industry\num is sitting at that 22 uh P that range\nthat I mentioned earlier. Sorry. Um\nand so applying these multiples to\nPanera's metrics gives us a range of\nimplied valuations. So using those\nconservative industry averages like I\nmentioned we get 10 10.8 to about 12.6\nbillion and um but if we believe Panera\num deserves premium multiples like fast\ncasual leaders given their digital\npenetration and growth capability we get\num a 15.3 to 19.8 8 billion um as\nrepresented here. And so I believe\nPanera sits somewhere in between. It's\nnot quite at Chipotle's premium um but\nthey're definitely above the industry\naverage. And so I want to actually look\nat what acquires have actually paid in\nthe past transactions like this. And so\nhere's some re uh relevant ones. So\nI analyze Subway's partial stake at\n12.5% Evida and a 25% premium Duncan\nbrands, Buffalo Wild Wings and actually\nPaneras. Um and so this average across\nthese um transactions at 14 times the\nIDA multiple and an average control\npremium of 29%.\nUm helps us really understand this\nbetter. Um this premium reflects the\nvalue of control and expected synergies\nas well as competitive bidding uh\ndynamics.\nSo\nnow looking at our implied narrow\nvaluation. So applying 14% or sorry 14\ntimes 900 milliona\num gives us a base valuation of 12.6\nbillion and with the average control\npremium we get 16.3 billion. So several\nimportant observations that I found from\nhere is that first as casual\nacquisitions consistently command\npremium multiples relative to the\nbroader restaurant industry and Panera's\n2017 transaction\num actually sets a precedent and\narguably a floor for their current\nvaluation they're undergoing right now.\nUm and then third, control premiums in\nthis sector average between 25 to 35%\nand they really reflect the strategic\nvalue and synergy potential. And\nfinally, since 2017, Panera's digital\ncapabilities have only strengthened\nwhich can justify higher multiples\ntoday. And so this precedent transaction\nsuggests a range between 12.6 to 16.3\nbillion. And so let me bring it all\ntogether with my synthesis and final\nrepresentation.\nSo valuation under my valuation summary\num I represented that\nmy DCF recommendations and um\nmy three other valuation um methods show\nthat um from all three of our methods\nour DCF suggests that 9.5 12.7 billion\nwith a midpoint around 11 billion and so\ntraining comps indicate that 10.8\n19.8 billion depending on which peers we\nwait most heavily. Um and then looking\nacross most um most methods um there's\nclear convergence in the 12 to 15\nbillion range and they didn't DCF\nprovides our intrinsic value and grow\naround 11 billion and the comps validate\nthat the market would value B 15 to 17\ntimes IBIDA\ngiven its growth growth profile and\npresidents confirmed that\nexcuse me\nuh acquirers\nacquirers um\nhave paid similar prices for a similar\noperation. Um and so based on this\ntriangulation here is my recommendation.\nUm the walkway price should be at 12.5\nbillion and this is the maximum absolute\nmass maximum for maintaining financial\nbuyer discipline. And so above this\nprice, KKR cannot achieve its 20% irr\neven with operational improvements. And\nso the opening bid should be about 138\nto 14.2 billion. And this range is\ncompetitive, but it still leaves room\nfor negotiation. And then we have a\nstrategic ceiling here of 50.5 billion.\nSo taking our bases competition from\nstrategic buyers like Starbucks or\nMcDonald's, they could potentially bid\nup to this level. by capturing\nsynergies. However, at this price, the\nreturns spend heavily on synergy\nrealization which is a bit riskier and\nout of your control. And so the\nrationale is very straightforward. Our\nDCF anchor validates 13 to 14 billion as\nfair intrinsic values and variable\ncompanies trading at 15 to 17 times. you\num support this range\nfor a premium national um operator and\ncompany and then present pre president\ntransactions at 13 to 15.5 it up with\ncontrol premiums align perfectly and um\nuh we know strategic buyers could\njustify the 15 to 16 billion dollars of\nsynergies. So\num and then additionally\num this distinction is really crucial\nbetween the financial versus strategic\nbuyers um perspective. So as a financial\nbuyer KKR obviously as a private equity\nfirm is focused on IRRa. 20% plus\nreturns over a 5 to seven whole year\nperiod and they create value through\noperational improvements and margin\nexpansion and digital acceleration and\nnew unit growth. And so for KKR the\nmaximum price um is 12.5 to 13.5 to hit\nreturn hurdles. But from a strategic\nbuyer perspective like Starbucks or\nMcDonald's they can justify higher\nprices through synergies. So store\noverlaps savings of 25 to 50 million\nannually and supply chain inter in\nintegration synergies that would happen\nare worth about 775 million in value.\nAnd so the digital platform levers that\ncould also occur in adding 100 million\nin value crosselling and traffic\nbenefits worth 200 million in\nincremental revenue. um are also very uh\nlucrative to our strategic buyer. And so\npresenting or valuing these synergies\nadds about2 to3 billion of value and\nsupporting prices up to 15 to 16 billion\nfor strategic buyer. And so in closing,\nI really recommend this deal structure.\nSo 40% equity, 5.5 billion from KKR and\nco-investors.\nUm 35% senior debt at 4.8 billion and a\nroughly a roughly 3.5%\nof 3.5 times leverage 15% subordinated\nor mezzine debt which is going to be at\nroughly 2.1 billion and a 10% management\nrollover of 1.4 billion. So this\nstructure balances returns with\nreasonable leverage and keeps management\nvery invested. So key terms should be a\n3% breakup fee for deal production, a\nmanagement retention packages to ensure\ncontinuity,\na standard regulatory and financing\nconditions and a four to six month\ntimeline to close. So any risks that\nexist\nthose are as follows. There's a high\nrisk of integration\num execution digital growth slowdown and\ncompetitive response are at a medium\nrisk and then financing disruption is\nalso at a medium risk or I'm sorry a\nlower risk um and that being said\nthere's no mitigation efforts that\nreally have to be planned out here\nhowever with our medium to high risk\nfactors we recommend that we retain\nmanagement teams which we will and then\nwe make conservatively productions\nand accelerate differentiation.Thank you so much for listening."
