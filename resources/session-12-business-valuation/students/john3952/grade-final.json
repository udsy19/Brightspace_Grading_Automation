  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as PV of future cash flows, implements a multi-scenario DCF with reported PVs/terminal value, and demonstrates use and sensitivity of the weighted average cost of capital—meeting the criterion thoroughly. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) corroborate a complete, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes a terminal value using a 3% perpetual growth assumption with a stated PV (7.7B) and quantifies that it comprises ~70% of total DCF, also verifying a 60–80% range and checking implied exit multiples. These specific calculations and validation steps demonstrate a thorough, conceptually sound treatment of the terminal value.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast period (multi‑year scenarios with stated growth rates) from the terminal period (3% perpetuity) and justifies short‑term vs long‑term assumptions, including validation that terminal value comprises a reasonable share of DCF. This thorough, scenario‑based treatment meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models free cash flows in a DCF and explicitly accounts for taxes, capex, and working capital, and uses those FCFs to derive enterprise value (showing FCF-to-firm thinking). However, they do not explicitly identify key components like EBIT/NOPAT or depreciation, nor state clearly that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise values and outlines a financing capital structure, but never shows subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) from EV to derive equity value nor dividing equity value by share count to produce a price per share. Given the absence of explicit EV→Equity bridge steps or a per-share calculation, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used WACC as the DCF discount rate and demonstrated sensitivity testing (Implement/Evolve), showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not present a defensible, documented WACC calculation or cite an industry benchmark—only toggled values—so treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a full PASS.",
