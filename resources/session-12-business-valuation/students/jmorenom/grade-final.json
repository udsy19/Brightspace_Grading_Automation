  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as modeling free cash flows and explicitly discounts those FCFs using scenario-specific WACC and terminal growth, and they implemented multi-scenario runs and sensitivity analysis. These elements show a thorough, applied introductory treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies the FCF components (NOPAT/taxes, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) and implements them in a DCF model. They discount those FCFs with scenario-specific WACC to derive enterprise value and run sensitivity checks, demonstrating understanding that these cash flows are used to value the firm (i.e., available to capital providers).\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements a terminal value via a growth-model in the DCF, runs it across multiple scenarios, and performs sensitivity analysis, and they state the terminal value typically comprises ~60–80% of total value—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual linkage by producing equity value from PE multiples and EV from EBITDA multiples, indicating awareness of the EV↔Equity relationship. However, they do not explicitly show subtracting net debt (or adding it) to bridge EV→Equity nor dividing Equity Value by share count to produce a price per share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly includes identifiable sections for projections, terminal value, WACC, and PV and documents running the DCF and deriving EV ranges using multiples (Represent + Implement). However, the transcript does not report specific numeric enterprise value outputs (only ranges/descriptions and the inputs used), so the work demonstrates correct structure and methodology but lacks explicit presented EV figures required for a full PASS.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student gives a clear, actionable direction for KKR (place opening bids in the lower half of the DCF-based range) and supports it with DCF and comps work. However, they do not provide a specific numeric valuation or explicit walkaway price (e.g., \"Panera is worth $X\"), so the recommendation is conceptually supported but not fully detailed.",
