  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple valuation approaches (DCF, market/transaction comps, strategic-buyer scenario), uses a dynamic DCF for sensitivity testing, and derives a clear recommended bid range with rationale based on the triangulation. Coverage is substantive and actionable, meeting the criterion for thorough triangulation and sensitivity.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states WACC, growth and margin projections, and an exit multiple (covering Projections, WACC, and TV) and reports a specific numeric enterprise value (~$30.8B). They also demonstrate implementation and validation via a runnable Python model and result discussion, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly provides a visual summary (football-field chart) and verbally reports the key valuation ranges and recommended bid, supported by a dynamic DCF model. The combination of Represent, Implement, and Validate evidence shows a thorough, actionable visual summary of valuation results, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, practical use of a DCF model and explicitly cites a 9% WACC as a modeling parameter, indicating use of a discount rate. However, they do not explicitly define DCF as the present value of future free cash flows or provide deeper explanation/examples of the methodology, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student references a DCF and EBITDA/WACC assumptions (DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages) but never identifies the core Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor states that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. Because those required conceptual elements are missing, the response fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission includes a terminal value via an exit multiple (\"exit at 16 times multiple\") and demonstrates implementation of a DCF model, so the basic TV calculation is present (PASS criterion partially met). However, the student does not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF’s value or discuss its sensitivity/implications, so treatment is correct but incomplete.",
