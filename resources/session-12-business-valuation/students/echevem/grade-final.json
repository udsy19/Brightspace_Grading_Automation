  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames DCF as discounting future free cash flows and calculates FCF items (NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, WC) with numeric results, then applies a WACC (9%) in the terminal-value perpetuity. These elements together show a thorough, introductory-level mastery of DCF methodology consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly identifies all FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) and provides a numeric FCF calculation, demonstrating practical application. It also articulates that FCF drives enterprise value and is used to derive equity value, showing a thorough conceptual and applied understanding consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly subtracts net debt from enterprise value to compute equity value and then divides by shares to produce a per-share price, with consistent numeric results (772 - 200 = 572; 572/50 ≈ 11.45). This clear, specific treatment satisfies the criterion fully.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes a terminal value using the growth (perpetuity) method and runs validation checks, showing conceptual understanding. However, they stop short of explicitly stating that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value or providing a detailed breakdown/analysis of TV's share, so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguishes an explicit forecast focus versus a terminal steady state and uses reasonable short-term (6%) and long-term (2.5%) growth assumptions, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is limited (only a single explicit forecast year rather than a multi-year explicit stage and more detailed justification of the short-term path), so the work is correct but not thoroughly developed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses WACC as the discount rate in a DCF (evidence) and frames cost of capital within the DRIVER workflow, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide a defensible derivation or supporting rationale for the 9% WACC (no industry average, CAPM/levering calculation, or sensitivity), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
