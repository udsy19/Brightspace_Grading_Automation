  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selects relevant peers (McDonald's, Chipotle, industry P/E) and demonstrates applying both P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples to Panera's metrics, including converting P/E-implied equity to enterprise value. This clear, multiple-example application meets the introductory comparable methodology standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission compares multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions), performs sensitivity via three DCF scenarios, and synthesizes them into a triangulated EV range with a clear recommended midpoint target and walk-away ceiling. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound triangulation and sensitivity analysis consistent with PASS standards.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly created multiple scenarios with differing revenue and EBITDA assumptions and ran a ~5-year projection feeding into FCF and a terminal value, and they validated scenario outcomes/terminal share. This demonstrates dynamic, multi-year projection logic beyond a static forecast, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the DCF components (project FCFs, discount at WACC, include Gordon terminal value) and shows implementation intent, but treatment is high-level with limited depth or numeric detail (no WACC derivation, discounting mechanics, or sensitivity/detailing). This matches a correct but basic conceptual understanding, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key FCF inputs (tax rate, D&A, CAPEX, working capital) and uses a WACC-discounted FCF to derive enterprise value, showing awareness that FCF is firm-level cash. However the treatment is brief and lacks explicit detail on NOPAT/EBIT mechanics and a clear walkthrough of the FCF formula, so the coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes a terminal value calculation (Gordon growth) and acknowledges the terminal value's contribution by monitoring the \"terminal value percent\" across scenarios, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief and lacks depth or quantitative examples, so it meets the PARTIAL standard rather than a thorough PASS.",
