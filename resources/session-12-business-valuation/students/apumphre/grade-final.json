  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission correctly links DCF to intrinsic value derived from projected cash generation and explicitly cites a 9% WACC used in the base case, plus a 5-year cash‑flow projection and margin assumptions. The combination of conceptual description, numeric assumptions, and an automated implementation shows a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers and applied multiples (public-market and precedent multiple ranges) to convert Panera metrics into EV ranges, with numeric outcomes and automated implementation. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages show both the conceptual choice of comps and practical application, meeting the introductory comparable-methodology standard thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple methods (DCF, trading comps, precedents), runs scenario sensitivity via an automated model, and synthesizes results into a clear valuation range (14–15.5bn). The evidence and the implemented Python sensitivity support a thorough, defensible triangulation, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct use of DCF and projects cash flows using EBIT margin and WACC, indicating some understanding of free-cash-flow drivers and firm-level valuation (IMPLEMENT evidence). However, it does not explicitly identify key FCF components like NOPAT/EBIT after tax, depreciation, CapEx, or changes in working capital, nor states that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly uses an exit-multiple terminal value approach (multiple-based exit in year 5) and automates valuation via a Python model, so the TV concept is present and applied. However, the student does not show an explicit terminal value calculation or discuss that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast and a terminal/exit (sell at a normalized multiple), and provides a concrete short-term revenue growth assumption (10%) and EBITDA ramp (75% in 5 years). However, they do not specify a terminal (perpetual) growth rate or provide detailed rationale for the long-term decline in growth beyond using a lower exit multiple, so the multi-stage growth treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",
