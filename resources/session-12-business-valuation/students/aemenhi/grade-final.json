  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines FCF, describes the DCF engine that discounts yearly FCF using scenario WACC, and computes a Gordon-growth terminal value, then validates sensitivity. These detailed, applied descriptions across Represent/Implement/Validate stages demonstrate a thorough introductory grasp, satisfying PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies the FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation, capex, NWC) and shows how FCF is used in the DCF to produce enterprise value and then equity value (EV minus debt), demonstrating that FCF represents cash available to capital providers. Implementation and scenario validation across DRIVER stages show applied, not merely superficial, understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements a terminal value via the Gordon growth formula and includes model safeguards (Implement/Represent). They also quantify and acknowledge that terminal value dominates total enterprise value (Validate), and run sensitivities—showing depth and correct understanding, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes computing EV and subtracting net debt to get equity value, demonstrating correct understanding of the EV→Equity bridge. However, there is no explicit statement that equity value is divided by share count to yield price per share (only use of P/E comps is mentioned), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly performed internal sanity checks (directional checks, sensitivities, comps/precedents within the model), demonstrating understanding of validation. However, they did not cite or compare outputs to any specific external sources or tools (websites/calculators) as required for a full PASS under the category-specific standard, so the rating is PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student produced an actionable recommendation framework and embedded numeric outputs in the model (implement + executive block) and referenced a strategic EV figure, showing they can generate a bid recommendation. However, the transcript lacks a clear, explicit final valuation range or fully narrated numeric walkaway/opening/target values tied step‑by‑step to the analysis, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
