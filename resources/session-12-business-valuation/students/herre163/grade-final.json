  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected sensible peers (Chipotle, McDonald's), cited specific multiples (PE and EV/EBITDA ranges), and applied them to Panera's stated EBITDA to generate precedent ranges (e.g., $10.8–$13.5b). Implementation evidence (Python engine outputs and football-field results) shows the comparable methodology was correctly and thoroughly executed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple valuation approaches (DCF scenarios plus trading/precedent multiples), ran sensitivity analysis (WACC vs terminal growth) and translated the triangulated results into a concrete bid range aligned with those methods. Coverage is specific and applied (scenarios, comps, precedents, sensitivity, and recommendation), meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly includes model sections for projections (revenue/EBITDA/FCF), specifies WACC and tax assumptions, references terminal growth sensitivity, and reports concrete enterprise values (e.g., $10.05B). These elements together satisfy the DCF structure requirement thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies DCF mechanics—projecting free cash flows and using a stated WACC to produce enterprise values—demonstrated in the implementation and discovery stages. However, the treatment is procedural and brief (model outputs and numbers) without a deeper, explicit explanation of present-value discounting or methodological nuances, so it meets a correct but basic level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references EBITDA and net income inputs and explicitly states they perform a free cash flow calculation, showing basic conceptual use (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT). However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates inclusion of a terminal-value-related calculation via sensitivity analysis on WACC vs terminal growth and ran a DCF engine (Implement). However, they do not explicitly state the terminal value method used (growth vs multiple) nor acknowledge that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF, so treatment is correct but incomplete.",
