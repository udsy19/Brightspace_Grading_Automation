  "transcript": "Hello I'm Jose and this is the comprehensive valuation of Panera Bread for a potential KKR takeover Using the driver framework I started by defining our objective to calculate a bid range that balances KKR's financial discipline against aggressive pricing of strategic competitors like McDonald's In the discovery phase I gather the key inputs Panera generates 900 million in EBITDA with a 15% margin While Chipotle trades at a high 35x PE historical precedent transactions for this sector sit lower between 12x and 15x EBITDA These percentages along with the 500 store growth plan formed the basis of my model\n\nSo basically we plugged that into Python the current and it's 900 million with a margin of 15% Net income we're gonna place at 400 with a WACC at 9% and a tax rate at 25% Shares outstanding is 100 So the scenarios we're gonna use revenue growth EBITDA margin expansion And then to for our model engine we're gonna do the revenue project projection with EBITDA projection with a margin expansion free cash flow calculation And so basically when we run this into Python we're gonna run the scenarios and we're gonna run everything as we talked about with the 35x and McDonald's 25x And then the precedent EBITDA with the 12 through 15x And we're just gonna plug this all into our code and this is what it came out\n\nSo moving to the implementation I built a Python based valuation engine If you look at the console output on the screen here are the DCF results With a bear case if execution stalls the value sits at 7 dollars and 47 no sorry 4.47 billion And a base case assuming steady growth we arrive at an enterprise value of 10.05 billion With a bull case this aggressive scenario pricing the full digital success yields at 13.22 billion So basically like I said these are the DCF results and this is what it comes out The bear case 7.47 billion base case at 10.05 billion and the bull case at 13.22 billion\n\nSo I validated these figures using the sensitive tables shown below the results by stressing the WACC against terminal growth We can see that even with the small variations the central valuation clustered tightly around the 10 million mark So I evolved this data into the football field chart you can see at the bottom So I wanted to do kind of like the football field to show this so this is like as you can see a football field like this is the end zone and this is the start so you start at this side and you end on this side\n\nSo basically um visualize this into the football field chart you can see at the bottom this visualization highlights the critical gap Trading comps the top bar as you can see right here the top bar was at 8.8 billion and 10 point 10 million 10 billion The precedent transaction the middle bar as you can see right here was at 10.8 billion to 13.5 billion You will notice I marked the strategic premium zone in a red starting around 14 billion This indicates where a strategic buyer like Starbucks might bid capitalizing on synergies that we as a financial buyer cannot access\nSo reflect finally to for like on reflect on the bid strategy the data shows that paying above 13.2 billion our bull case destroys value for KKR So my recommendations opening bid at 10.8 billion this aligns with the low end of a precedent transaction and offers a slight premium over the base case DCF of 10.05 billion Negotiating ceiling 12.5 billion this is the midpoint of the precedent range Walk away price at 13 million billion As shown in the football field anything approaching 13.5 billion or entering the 14 billion red zone is purely strategic territory If the price goes there we should let the strategics have it as the return will not meet our private equity hurdle rates Thank you"
