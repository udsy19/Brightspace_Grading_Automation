  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as valuing future free cash flows, applies WACC (8.5%) as the discount rate, computes terminal value and analyzes present-value contribution and sensitivities. Coverage goes beyond a brief mention—showing implementation and reflection—so it meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated terminal value using a growth assumption (WACC 8.5%, terminal growth 2%) and quantified that the PV of TV is ~75% of enterprise value, discussing risk thresholds and sensitivity. This shows a thorough, applied understanding of the terminal value concept and its implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast (multi-year revenue growth ~3% with base/downside/upside cases) from a terminal period and specifies a terminal growth rate (2%). They justify and critique that assumption (calling it pessimistic), quantify its impact (terminal PV ≈75% of EV), and perform sensitivity analysis—demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates partial understanding: they modelled FCFF with tax and depreciation inputs and used DCFs (Implement/Discover evidence), but they did not explicitly address CapEx or working capital and misdescribed FCFF as \"after all interest payments,\" indicating a conceptual inaccuracy about cash available to capital providers. This supports a PARTIAL score.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports EV and equity value outcomes and describes valuation steps (Discover/Implement) but never demonstrates the required EV→Equity bridge mechanics: there is no explicit subtraction of net debt (debt less cash) to derive equity value, nor any division of equity value by share count to produce price per share. The transcript even shows conceptual confusion about using EV/EBITDA, so the criterion is not met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the valuation object (Panera) and acquisition context and names KKR as a stakeholder, and provides a clear methodological plan (Discover + Represent stages). However, they do not explicitly identify \"management\" as a stakeholder as required, so the problem framing is incomplete.",
