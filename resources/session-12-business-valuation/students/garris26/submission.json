  "transcript": "0:00\nHello, welcome to session 12 for\n0:02\nmanagement 310 financial management. Um,\n0:06\nand in today's session, our assignment\n0:08\noverview and goal is to deliver a full\n0:11\nvaluation of Panera Bread for a pro\n0:14\nprospective KKR takeover using the\n0:16\ndriver framework. And we're going to be\n0:18\ndoing this by combining the DSF trading\n0:20\ncomps and president transactions to\n0:22\nproduce an informed bid range while\n0:24\ncontrasting financial buyer discipline\n0:26\nwith strategic buyer uh synergies as\n0:29\nwell. So looking at our deal snapshot\n0:32\nhere, I just screenshotted this from\n0:36\num\n0:37\nthe assignment right here. And we can\n0:42\nsee that the scale of this project is at\n0:45\n6 billion revenue growing at 8% with 900\n0:49\nmillion um in earnings before interest,\n0:52\ntaxes, depreciation, and or\n0:55\nmortarization.\n0:56\nUh and then we can see that's growing at\n0:58\na 15% margin. And we also have a $400\n1:01\nmillion net income across 2,100\n1:05\nstores. And then digital sales are\n1:07\nalready at 50% as well. Um and to look\n1:10\nat the market references, we can see\n1:13\nthat the industry uh price\n1:17\nuh divided by earnings per share is at\n1:21\n22 times right now. And then it's at a\n1:25\n12 to 15 time multiplier. And we can see\n1:28\nthat uh some of the competitors like\n1:31\nChipotle and McDonald's are trading at\n1:33\n35 to 25 times um as well. And some of\n1:38\nthe capital assumptions that we have is\n1:41\nthat the industry's whack which is\n1:43\naverage return required by investors is\n1:46\nat 9% and management wants to push that\n1:48\nto 10% roll a 10% rollover. Uh and then\n1:52\nthe strategic biders are also circling\n1:54\nas well. uh specifically companies like\n1:56\nStarbucks and McDonald's.\n1:58\nAnd looking at the growth levers, we see\n2:01\nthat there's 500 new stores in the next\n2:03\nfive years and that digital mix is up to\n2:06\n70% which is really good as well as\n2:09\ndinner and catering expansions and even\n2:11\nan early stage international roll out.\n2:14\nSo those are things that are ahead of\n2:16\nthat are going to bring in growth. And\n2:19\nfinally, we just want to create an\n2:20\nexecutive ready recommendation that\n2:23\nstates the valuation range, winning bid\n2:26\nstrategy, as well as a rationale for\n2:29\nchoosing financial versus a strategic\n2:32\nposition.\n2:34\nUm, and before moving on to our\n2:37\nrepresent stage, we want to define some\n2:40\nof these terms just for people to get a\n2:43\nbetter understanding. So the pro\n2:46\nprospective KKR takeover is just the\n2:48\npotential acquisition uh by the private\n2:51\nequity KKR which is analyzing Panera's\n2:54\nvalue and ideal bid range um before\n2:57\npurchasing it. The valuation just\n2:59\nestimates what the company's worth using\n3:02\nDSF which is discounted cash flow. Um\n3:05\nand also comparable using DSF comparable\n3:08\ncompanies and president deals as well.\n3:11\nAnd discounted cash flow is values a\n3:14\nfirm based on the future free cash flow\n3:17\ndiscounted by the average return\n3:19\nrequired by investors which is the\n3:21\nwhack. And basically it just shows the\n3:24\nintrinsic value of the of the firm. Um,\n3:30\nand then the whack is just used at a\n3:33\ndiscount rate in DSF as you can see. And\n3:36\nthen the earnings before interest,\n3:39\ntaxes, depreciation, and armorization\n3:42\nmeasures the core profitability before\n3:45\nfinancing and accounting items are taken\n3:48\ninto consideration.\n3:50\nAnd then the PE ratio is the share price\n3:54\ndivided by earnings per share. And it\n3:56\njust mark it measures how the market\n3:58\nvalues a company's profits. As we saw\n4:01\nearlier in the market reference, we can\n4:03\nsee that the industry's\n4:05\nprice dividend by earnings per share is\n4:07\nat 22 times and that Chipotle is at 35\n4:10\nand 25. So we kind of get a good idea\n4:13\nlooking at that. And the synergies is\n4:15\nextra value from a merger such as cost\n4:18\nsavings or revenue growth. Finally, the\n4:21\nlast term to define is control premium.\n4:24\nSo this is the amount paid above the\n4:25\nmarket value to gain a full ownership of\n4:28\na company. And so our key key question\n4:32\nafter looking at all this is what is a\n4:33\njustified value valuation range and bid\n4:36\nstrategy for KKR given these operating\n4:39\ntrends and market benchmarks.\n4:42\nSo\n4:44\nmoving on to our represent stage in the\n4:46\ndriver framework. Our plan of execution\n4:49\nhere before implementing is to build a\n4:52\nthree scenario DSF. So we're going to be\n4:55\nlooking at the base upside and downside\n4:59\nsensitivities. And next we want to run a\n5:02\ncomparable company. So this is basically\n5:04\njust saying what are similar companies\n5:06\ntrading for right now and a president\n5:09\ntransaction analysis which is saying\n5:11\nwhat have buyers paid for similar\n5:13\ncompanies in the past. So current what\n5:16\nare what are similar companies trading\n5:18\nfor right now and we're going to be\n5:19\nlooking at the past as well. What have\n5:21\ncompanies been bought for or what have\n5:24\nbuyers paid for similar companies in the\n5:26\npast. And then next we're going to add\n5:29\nsections contrasting the financial\n5:30\nversus strategic buyer assumptions. Uh\n5:33\nso we got to take into consider\n5:35\nsynergies um control premium like paying\n5:38\nmore to have full ownership and then the\n5:40\nroller roll roll over equity which was\n5:42\nif you remember earlier instead of 9% up\n5:45\nto 10%\n5:46\num of the whack and then combining the\n5:50\nresults into a football field chart.\n5:52\nIt's not actually a football field. They\n5:55\njust use that as a term. Um but it's\n5:59\nbasically just visualizes the methods,\n6:02\nthe valuation methods and identifies a\n6:05\nfair bid range. Uh so we'll have that as\n6:08\nwell. And finally, we want to include\n6:10\nsensitivity toggles in a spreadsheet for\n6:12\ngrowth to test how small changes impact\n6:15\nuh the overall valuation outcomes.\n6:19\nAnd so\n6:21\nhere is our implement.\n6:23\nThese are just screenshots from the\n6:25\nspreadsheet that I created for the\n6:26\nimplement stage. Um, as you can see, I\n6:29\ncreated a couple graphs here just to\n6:31\nvisualize um the sensitivity by growth\n6:35\nscenario. Um, and then as well as the\n6:39\nthe football field graph that we were\n6:41\nshowing earlier. Um, and I can actually\n6:44\ngo into the spreadsheet here um to show\n6:49\nyou. So at the bottom I started just\n6:52\nputting in the inputs tab. So here I\n6:54\nentered the main assumptions for Panera\n6:57\nuh like the revenue at 6 billion 900\n7:01\nmillion in um EBIT TDA and then the net\n7:08\nincome was around 4 billion\n7:11\nor 400 million\n7:13\nand then I also included the growth rate\n7:16\nthe whack and terminal growth along with\n7:19\nthe industry multiples like uh the PE\n7:22\nratio go and also the EV over\n7:28\num the earnings before uh interest.\n7:33\nUm\n7:38\nand\n7:40\nmoving on to our val the valuation here.\n7:43\nThis is where you can see um the three\n7:47\nmain valuation methods DSF, the trading\n7:50\ncomps and then the president\n7:53\ntransactions.\n7:55\nUm and you can see that\n7:58\nuh together the total implied valuation\n8:02\nis around 41 billion. Um and you can see\n8:06\nthat I put in uh equations here at the\n8:09\ntop based on my inputs in the beginning.\n8:14\nSo I just took it take it directly um\n8:18\nfrom the net income and then I used uh\n8:23\nthe the P low and high to find\n8:27\num\n8:28\nthe the trading comps. And then for the\n8:31\npres president transactions I used um\n8:35\nthe low to high here which was 12 and 15\n8:39\num for the EV over the equity before\n8:43\ninterest.\n8:44\nUm and that's how I got the number here\n8:47\nat around 12 billion. Um\n8:51\nand so\n8:54\nbelow that you can see that I also\n8:56\ncreated um a sensitivity different\n8:59\nsensitivity scenarios. So I have\n9:01\ndownside, base and upside here. Um, and\n9:04\nyou can see the base is around 99\n9:06\nbillion.\n9:08\nUm, and with the upside\n9:11\nbasically I just created I copied the\n9:14\ninput.\n9:16\nUm, and I just duplicated it on each\n9:20\nthree different slides. And so the base\n9:22\nis just what the input is regularly at\n9:25\nthe growth rates still at 0.08.\n9:28\nUm, and for the upside, I changed the\n9:30\ngrowth rate to 0.1.\n9:32\nAnd for the downside, I lowered the\n9:34\ngrowth rate to 0.06.\n9:37\nSo, I just moved it by uh 02\n9:41\nuh percentages up and down. Uh, but you\n9:45\ncan see how big of a difference it\n9:46\nactually makes in the DSF value here as\n9:48\nthe upside goes over to a 100red billion\n9:52\nand the uh downside drops down to just\n9:56\n97 billion. So moves around makes sense\n10:00\nthat it moves um the same as like the\n10:03\npercentage. Uh but that's also very\n10:05\ninteresting. And then I created a graph\n10:08\nhere to visualize it. Uh and changed up\n10:10\nthe color just so it's more appealing\n10:13\nand easier if you were just showing it\n10:14\nto a company.\n10:16\nUm and so you can see that the trading\n10:21\ncomps and president transaction values\n10:23\nare just based on the industry averages.\n10:26\nUm and then moving on here is the\n10:32\nvaluation different valuation methods\n10:34\nthat I used. Um and so\n10:39\nuh I combined all three evaluation\n10:41\nmethods into one visual and it just\n10:43\nshows how each approach compares. uh and\n10:46\nthat uh Panera's fair value range sits\n10:49\nroughly between\n10:51\num\n10:53\n100 and 120 billion. Um and so I also\n10:59\ncreated a graph for that just so you can\n11:01\nsee\n11:02\nuh the average compared to the three\n11:05\ndifferent valuation methods. Um and so\n11:09\ngoing back to our framework here, so\n11:11\nfrom this analysis, uh like I was\n11:14\nsaying, my average valuation for Panera\n11:16\ncomes out to be around 41 billion.\n11:19\nHowever, a strategic buyer like\n11:20\nMcDonald's might be paying be willing to\n11:22\npay up to 10 to 15%\n11:26\nmore premium over that base of valuation\n11:29\ngiven the potential digital and\n11:31\noperating synergies between the two\n11:33\ncompanies. So that's something that I\n11:35\nthought was important to mention as\n11:37\nwell. Um and so moving on, we want to\n11:41\nvalidate our uh implement stage. So I\n11:45\nchecked that my DSF trading comps and\n11:48\npresident transactions all landed in a\n11:50\nconsistent valuation range which was\n11:52\nroughly between 100 to 120 billion.\n11:55\nAnd then the DSF also implied the PE\n11:59\nmultiply was about around 22 as we saw\n12:02\nearlier. and it aligned closely with the\n12:04\nindustry average which confirms that the\n12:06\nassumptions are realistic. And then the\n12:09\nsensitivity section shows that even with\n12:11\na slight chance to grow uh to the growth\n12:13\nthe valuation remains stable. And\n12:16\nfinally the strategic case only becomes\n12:18\nstronger if the synergies are actually\n12:20\ncaptured. So while the base financial\n12:22\nvaluation um remains more reliable um we\n12:27\ncan see that\n12:29\nuh it only just becomes stronger once\n12:30\nthose synergies are actually captured.\n12:34\nAnd so next we want to um hypothetically\n12:37\nevolve. So I could expand the model by\n12:42\nadding more detailed scenarios for\n12:43\ngrowth and profitability to make future\n12:46\nvaluations more dynamic. Um and\n12:48\nspecifically for the football field\n12:50\nchart, I could include a clear breakdown\n12:52\nbetween financial and strategic buyers\n12:54\nwhich would show how potential synergies\n12:56\nwould shift um the range. And the future\n13:00\nversions could also test the sensitivity\n13:03\nof results different um by using\n13:06\ndifferent whack or terminal growth\n13:07\nassumptions to strengthen the analysis.\n13:10\nAnd finally, these improvements would\n13:12\nmake the model more flexible, realistic\n13:15\nand visually appealing and clear for\n13:18\ndecision makers. Um and our final step\n13:21\nof the driver framework is to reflect.\n13:24\nUm so this valuation showed how\n13:26\nfinancial and strategic buyers view the\n13:28\nsame company differently as financial\n13:31\nbuyers emphasize returns and cash yield\n13:34\nwhile on the other hand strategic buyers\n13:36\nlook at more of a long-term growth and\n13:39\nscale for um the company and combining\n13:42\nDSF comparable companies and the\n13:44\npresident transaction adds credibility\n13:47\nand flexibility to the overall analysis\n13:49\nand automatic automating sensitivity\n13:53\nchecks. in the model made it easier to\n13:56\nvisualize the impact of small assumption\n13:59\nchanges.\n14:00\nAnd then finally, the data the\n14:03\nprocessing demonstrates that discipline\n14:05\nassumptions and scenario testing lead to\n14:07\nclearer datadriven valuation insights.\n14:11\nThat is my session 12 project. Thank you\n14:14for listening."
