  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines DCF as the present value of future free cash flows and explicitly states that WACC is used as the discount rate, then implements a three‑scenario DCF with WACC, growth and terminal assumptions and sensitivity analysis. The combination of clear definition, stated use of WACC, and practical implementation across Represent/Implement/Reflect meets the PASS standard for introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states that WACC (\"whack\") is the discount rate for DCF and shows a defensible WACC choice (industry average 9%, with a 10% management scenario) entered in the model inputs and discussed in reflection. Coverage demonstrates correct conceptual application plus practical implementation and planned sensitivity testing, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's/Starbucks) and applied both P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples to Panera's net income and EBITDA, producing implied valuations and checking consistency across methods. Coverage is substantive and shows correct, applied use of comparable methodology at an introductory level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual recognition that DCF uses free cash flow and WACC and uses EBITDA/net income inputs, but they do not demonstrate the required FCF component breakdown (NOPAT/EBIT adjustment, depreciation add-back, CapEx, change in working capital) nor explicitly state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. This yields a correct but incomplete treatment → PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly included terminal growth as an input and ran DCF scenario sensitivity around growth, demonstrating conceptual use of a terminal assumption. However, they did not explicitly show a terminal value calculation (growth- or multiple-based) nor acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, basic multi‑stage thinking by building explicit base/upside/downside scenarios, varying short‑term growth (6–10%), and including a terminal growth input. However, they do not clearly document a distinct explicit forecast period length nor a reasoned, lower terminal growth rate or rationale tying terminal growth to long‑run fundamentals, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
