  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly performs a DCF, reports terminal and multi-year present values (showing PV of future cash flows) and explicitly calculates/uses WACC (9%) with sensitivity tests. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the introductory DCF criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses a five‑year explicit forecast with concrete short‑term growth drivers (store adds, digital mix, % revenue/EBITDA growth) and separately calculates terminal value using a lower long‑term growth assumption (3%) with sensitivity testing. That combination of explicit forecast, terminal reasoning, numerical assumptions, and validation demonstrates a thorough multi‑stage growth approach.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used WACC = 9% as the discount assumption (noted as industry-weighted and \"calculated down to nine percent\") and applied it in the DCF outputs. They also validated the choice with a sensitivity analysis showing material value impact, demonstrating both application and a defensible, tested WACC — meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses Free Cash Flow in the DCF (reports a year‑one FCF margin and DCF-derived values) showing conceptual application (Implement/Discover). However, they do not explicitly identify the standard FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates a terminal value and reports its present value, and they compare that PV (2,313m) to the PV of the discrete five-year cash flows (954m), showing TV dominates the valuation. However, they do not explain which TV method (growth vs. multiple) or detail the assumptions/methodology, so treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual treatment of the EV→Equity bridge in the LBO context (explicit equity check and debt capacity figures), showing partial mastery. However, there is no explicit statement of subtracting Net Debt from EV nor any division by share count or reporting of a price‑per‑share, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
