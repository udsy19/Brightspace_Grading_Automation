One, we want\nto find our valuation\n\n63\n00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,690\nrange, our walkaway\nprice, and the\n\n64\n00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,650\nnegotiation strategy\nthat we have. So for the\n\n65\n00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,030\nnext step, R, we're\ngoing to represent\n\n66\n00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,100\nthe potential plans that\nwe have outlined for\n\n67\n00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,730\nKKR and Panera as two\nseparate entities.\n\n68\n00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,650\nSo we're going to look\nat this in terms of\n\n69\n00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,090\nthree methods, the DCF\nanalysis, the trading\n\n70\n00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,270\ncomps that are currently\nin place, and then\n\n71\n00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,590\nthe precedent M&A deal.\nSo our base case five\n\n72\n00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,290\n-year projection with\nthe current store market\n\n73\n00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,050\nthat we have, which\nis 2,100 stores in\n\n74\n00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,350\nyear zero starting today,\nand what the increase\n\n75\n00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,030\nfor the next five\nyears would be, which\n\n76\n00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,990\nshows that our revenue\nwould be increasing by\n\n77\n00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,180\n11.8%, EBITDA by 13.9%,\n9% and the store growth\n\n78\n00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,220\nwould be 4.4% which\nis pretty good and\n\n79\n00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,140\nshowing that we're going\nin the right direction\n\n80\n00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,200\nmeaning that one\nwe're making way more\n\n81\n00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,640\nrevenue across this five\nyears but we've also\n\n82\n00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,180\nexpanded and have more\nthan 2100 stores at\n\n83\n00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,100\nthe end of this five\nyears the free cash flow\n\n84\n00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,580\nSo if we break\nit all down,\n\n85\n00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,440\ngiven our EBITDA\nthat we have,\n\n86\n00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,980\nif we end up with\na year one FCF\n\n87\n00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,500\nmargin of 3.7%\nof the revenue,\n\n88\n00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,120\nif we look at,\nobviously, the other\n\n89\n00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,640\noptions, such as the\ntrading comparables\n\n90\n00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,680\nagainst Panera Bread,\nChipotle, Shake\n\n91\n00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,500\nShack, Sweet Green,\nand the Cava Group,\n\n92\n00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,380\nuh we realized we\nrealized that the implied\n\n93\n00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,740\nvaluation range using\nthese comparables are\n\n94\n00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,480\nthat um for conservative\nof a 12x ebitda we\n\n95\n00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,280\nhave 10.8 billion\ndollars we have a market\n\n96\n00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,200\nof 12.2 billion dollars\nand an aggressive um\n\n97\n00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,040\nebitda would be 13.5\nbillion dollars for us\n\n98\n00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,140\nand the president m&a\ntransactions uh basically\n\n99\n00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,960\nimply more or less\nthe same uh type of\n\n100\n00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,000\nvalues for um the implied\nvaluation of panera\n\n101\n00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,100\nand we compared that\nwith you know other\n\n102\n00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,040\nbrands that are actually\ntransactions of either\n\n103\n00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,860\nfinancial or strategic\nbuyers in this case\n\n104\n00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,120\nand then another\nfactor we did take into\n\n105\n00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,020\nconsideration was uh\nif we go through this\n\n106\n00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,320\nfive-year deal what\nwould it look like for\n\n107\n00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,360\nour weighted average\ncost of capital which\n\n108\n00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,200\nwe calculated down\nto nine percent for\n\n109\n00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:52,420\nus so overall our our\nbid strategy for this\n\n110\n00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,500\ntaking all this\ninformation into account\n\n111\n00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,200\nis if we went with a\nfinancial buyer our\n\n112\n00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,620\nour requirements and\nconstraints would be\n\n113\n00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,960\nthat an equity check\nof $77 to $8 billion,\n\n114\n00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,840\na debt capacity of\n4 to 5 times the\n\n115\n00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,720\ncurrent EBITDA, the\nmaximum bid would\n\n116\n00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,580\nprobably be around $11\n.5 to $12.5 billion,\n\n117\n00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,480\nand a target\nIRR of 20 to 25\n\n118\n00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480\n% over the next\n5 to 7 years.\n\n119\n00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,360\nIf we chose to go with\na strategic buyer,\n\n120\n00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,120\nour advantage is\nthat we can justify\n\n121\n00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,840\n14 to 16x EBITDA in the\nfuture the potential\n\n122\n00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,520\nbid range is\nobviously 13 to 16\n\n123\n00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520\nbillion so that's\nway more money than a\n\n124\n00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,440\nfinancial buyer and\nit lowers our cost of\n\n125\n00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,860\ncapital well so for\nkkr as a competitive\n\n126\n00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,780\npositioning we would\nhave to look at it in\n\n127\n00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,520\nterms of kkr would\nhave to um prioritize\n\n128\n00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,720\nour operational\nexpertise and partnership\n\n129\n00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,880\napproach modes highlight\nthe management rollover\n\n130\n00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,640\nalignment move quickly\nwith the committed\n\n131\n00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,520\nfinancing that we\nhave and our walkaway\n\n132\n00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,760\nprice would probably\nhave to be around 12.5\n\n133\n00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,760\nbillion just to meet\nlike 14x our current\n\n134\n00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,480\nEBITDA which it it's\nnot very likely that\n\n135\n00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,980\nit can be competed\nalone price alone versus\n\n136\n00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,480\nagainst a strategic\nbuyer but now that we\n\n137\n00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,060\nhave all this context\nwe're going to move on\n\n138\n00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,560\nto i implement to\nactually make the full\n\n139\n00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,600\nvaluation calculations\non each of our methods\n\n140\n00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,620\nand see what do our\nnumbers actually fruit\n\n141\n00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,120\nand uh give out as\nour like conclusion\n\n142\n00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,900\nto this um difficult\nproblem to assess okay\n\n143\n00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,560\nhere we have um we\nhave obviously the\n\n144\n00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,620\nvarious um implementations\nso part one we\n\n145\n00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,690\nhave the dcf discounted\ncash flow analysis\n\n146\n00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,080\nwhere um we see that\nour terminal value\n\n147\n00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,400\nis three thousand seven\nhundred twenty six\n\n148\n00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,440\nmillion dollars whereas\nthe present value\n\n149\n00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,100\nof that would be of\nthe terminal value\n\n150\n00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,500\nis 2,313 million and\nour present value over\n\n151\n00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,110\nthe five years would\nbe 954 million and\n\n152\n00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,960\nmeaning our implied\nEBITDA multiple would\n\n153\n00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,960\nbe around 3.6x what\nwe currently have.\n\n154\n00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,400\nthat is pretty standard\num with our either\n\n155\n00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,020\nbase case or upside\nscenarios we'd have around\n\n156\n00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,440\non that same amount\nso our dcf valuation\n\n157\n00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,100\nuh basically shows us\nthat um our enterprise\n\n158\n00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,380\nvalue through our beta\nover the five years\n\n159\n00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,500\ndoes end up being an\nincreasing one So we\n\n160\n00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,080\nare in, I guess, good\nstanding in that case.\n\n161\n00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,260\nSecond part is trading\n\n162\n00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,200\ncomparables analysis.\n\n163\n00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,300\nSo comparing us with\nother similar types of\n\n164\n00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,380\nbusinesses where we've\ncompared, obviously,\n\n165\n00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,180\nthe EBITDA, the PE value,\nthe revenue growth.\n\n166\n00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,540\nand um it basically\ngives us the conclusion\n\n167\n00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,060\nthat uh panera versus\nour peers would be\n\n168\n00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,160\nthat the digital mix\nof 50 percent that we\n\n169\n00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,200\nhave is higher than most\npeers currently
