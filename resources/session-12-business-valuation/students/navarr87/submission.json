  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Jorge Navarro. In this\npresentation, I'll be conducting a\ncomprehensive business valuation of\nPanera Bread from the perspective of\nKKR, which is a financial buyer. I've\nstructured this analysis using the\nDRIVER Framework to ensure a rigorous,\ndata-backed recommendation.\nMy objective is to determine a winning\nbid range that balances financial\ndiscipline with the reality of a\ncompetitive market where strategic\nbuyers like Starbucks or McDonald's may\nalso be circling.\nSo this is the code that I've created to\ndo this analysis, and we're going to\nbegin with Stage 1 of DRIVER, which is\nDefine and Discover. So moving into the\nDefine and Discover Stage. Based on\nthe deal snapshot, we're looking at a\ncompany with $6 billion in revenue and\n$900 million in EBITDA, which is earnings\nbefore interest, tax, depreciation,\nand amortization. I've set up my\nPython script here using the dictionary\ncalled 'assumptions,' which is just\nthis dictionary right here. And this is\ncrucial for the technical implementation\nof this assignment because it allows me\nto parameterize my inputs.\nSo, I have our WACC set at 9%. I've\ninputed the tax rate at 25%. And I've\nestablished three growth scenarios. \nA Base case with 8% growth, an Upside\ncase with 12%, and a Downside case with\n4%.\nSo, now we're going to move on to Stage\n2 of DRIVER, which is Represent. And\nin the Represent Stage, I mapped out the\nlogic for my valuation models, and I\ncreated two primary functions. So first\nI created the calculate_DCF function,\nwhich is this function right here, and\nthis essentially automates the\nDiscounted Cash Flow analysis, and it\ntakes our Revenue and EBITDA inputs and\niterates through a 5-year forecast. So,\ncrucially, um, to get to Free Cash Flow,\nI am stripping out taxes and an\nestimated reinvestment rate of 4% for\nCapEx and Net Working Capital. And I'm\nusing the Gordon Growth Method for the\nterminal value, assuming a 3% long-term\ngrowth rate consistent with GDP.\nSo, now, what I want to\ndo is, I want to highlight the\ncalculate_comps function right here in\nthe code. And I built this function, and it basically\nstandardizes our relative valuation. And\nI'm looking at an Industry P/E ratios of\n22x, alongside premium peers like\nChipotle at 35x. And I'm also\ncalculating precedent transactions\nbased on EBITDA multiples of 12x to\n15x. And this ensures that we\naren't relying on a single methodology.\nSo now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to move on to our Stage 3 of\nDRIVER, which is Implement. And we're\ngonna run the code for this so we can\nview the output.\nSo let's go to the output for Implement.\nAnd as you can see, this is it right\nhere. So I've run the model across\nall three scenarios, the Base, the\nUpside, and the Downside. So if you look\nat the Base Case Projections table\ngenerated right here, you can see the\nfinancial trajectory. So we start with\nuh $6 billion in revenue growing, to\nroughly $8.8 billion by year five. And\nthen our EBITDA grows from $900 million to\n$1.3 billion from uh Year 1 to Year 5.\nAnd then most importantly, if you look\nat the um Free Cash Flow column, we're\ngenerating positive cash flow starting\nat $469.8 million in Year 1.\nAnd um so now based on these cash flows\nand a 9% WACC, the model returns a Base\nCase Enterprise Value of approximately\n$9.247 billion. And this is the anchor\nfor our financial decision-making.\nSo now we're going to go to Stage\n4 of DRIVER, and we're going to stay\nin our output, which is our Validate.\nAnd a validation is only as good as its\nassumptions. So I moved to the Validate\nStage to test the robustness of the\nmodel using Python to generate a\nsensitivity matrix. And I tested the\nEnterprise Value against changes in\nWACC, which are the rows, and Terminal\nGrowth, which are the columns. So our\nBase Case is at the intersection of 9%\nWACC and 3% growth right here, $9.247\nbillion.\nHowever, if market volatility pushes our\ncost of capital up to 10%, our value\ndrops to roughly $7.899 billion, which is\nthis row right here. Conversely, if we\nexecute perfectly on the digital rollout\nand hit higher growth, we could justify\nup to $15 billion. And this table is\ncrucial for KKR because it defines our\n'Zone of Safety.' We cannot bid assuming a\nperfect 8% WACC environment. So now\nwe're going to go to Stage 5, which is\nEvolve. And in the Evolve Stage, I\naddress the specific assignment\nrequirement to contrast Financial versus\nStrategic buyers. So as KKR, we are a\nfinancial buyer. We rely on operational\nimprovements and leverage. However, a\nstrategic buyer like McDonald's or\nStarbucks has a massive advantage:\nSynergies.\nSo, let's go to the code up here for\nEvolve, and right here\nwe have our synergy_value,\nand essentially\nthis is synergy_value right here. So,\nI modeled these synergies in the code\nhere, and I assumed a strategic buyer\ncould eliminate 5% of Operating Expenses\ndue to the supply chain overlap and\nshared overhead. And when capitalized,\nthese synergies are worth $2.125\nbillion on top of the standalone value.\nThis means while KKR sees a $9.247\nbillion asset, our strategic buyer might\nsee an $11.372\nbillion asset. And this informs our\nnegotiation strategy. We cannot win a\npure war price war against a strategic\nbidder. So now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to move on to Stage 6 of\nDRIVER based on this information, which\nis Reflect. And here's our visual.\nSo finally we arrive at Reflect, and I've\nvisualized the data in this 'Football\nField' chart to triangulate our position.\nSo the Top Bar shows our DCF range.\nThe Middle Bars show the market comps.\nAnd notice that Chipotle's 35x P/E\nimplies a massive valuation that is\nlikely an outlier for Panera. And then\nwe have the Bottom Bar, which shows the\nstrategic valuation including synergies.\nSo based on all of this information,\nmy final recommendation based on this\nanalysis, I recommend KKR sets a Target\nBid of $13.5 billion, with a hard ceiling\nat $14.2 billion, which is roughly 1.05x \nour base valuation. And our\nrationale behind this, beginning with\nValuation is a $13.5 billion represents\na fair multiple of roughly 15x\nEBITDA, consistent with precedent\ntransactions. And then our second\nrationale is Strategy. We should not\ncompete above $15 billion because if a\nstrategic buyer bids that high, they're\npaying for synergies we cannot realize,\nand we should walk away at that point.\nThen lastly, we have a Structure,\nwhere we should leverage the management\nteam's desire for a 10% rollover. And\nthis reduces our cash outlay and keeps\nmanagement incentivized to hit the\nupside growth targets of 500 new stores.\nAnd this approach balances\nthe aggressive growth of Panera's\ndigital platform with the financial\ndiscipline required of private equityinvestment. Thank you."
