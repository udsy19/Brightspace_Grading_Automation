  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and implements a DCF: they model free cash flows (taxes, reinvestment, terminal value) and explicitly use WACC (9%) to derive enterprise value, with sensitivity testing of WACC. The treatment includes concrete assumptions, implementation, and validation, meeting a thorough introductory-level standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast horizon (5 years) from a terminal period and uses a standard Gordon Growth terminal rate (3%). They also specify reasonable short-term scenario rates (4%/8%/12%) and validate robustness via sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (e.g., Chipotle) and industry P/E, and they computed and applied precedent EBITDA multiples (12x–15x) to justify a 15x EBITDA valuation and $13.5B target bid. The work shows correct, applied comparable methodology across Represent/Implement/Reflect stages, with sufficient depth for an introductory-level PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models FCF by starting from EBITDA, stripping taxes, and applying a reinvestment assumption for CapEx and working capital (evidence 1) and implements this in the DCF (evidence 2). However, treatment is basic: depreciation/transition from EBITDA to NOPAT/EBIT is not explicitly addressed and the student does not explicitly state that FCF is the cash available to all capital providers—thus the concept is demonstrated but not in thorough, detailed form required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value calculation (Gordon Growth) and demonstrates its impact via sensitivity analysis, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, they do not explicitly state that the terminal value constitutes the majority of the DCF value—only imply its importance through sensitivities—so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports Enterprise Value and recommended transaction bids but there is no evidence they subtracted Net Debt (or Debt less Cash) to compute Equity Value, nor any division by share count to derive Price Per Share. Given those missing steps in the Implement/Reflect outputs, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
