  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified and implemented a DCF analysis, cited a discount rate (WACC = 9%) and a terminal growth assumption, and produced scenario PV valuations—demonstrating correct conceptual use of discounting future cash flows. The work is applied across multiple scenarios and stages (Discover/Implement/Reflect), meeting the thoroughness expected for a pass at this level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and cited industry PE and precedent EBITDA multiples, then applied those multiples to produce specific valuation outcomes and a triangulated range. The analysis includes multiple examples and integration with DCF results, demonstrating a thorough introductory comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applied multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions), synthesized them into a triangulated valuation spread, and provided a recommended bid range with rationale (financial vs strategic buyer, synergies/premium). They also reflected on uncertainty and next steps, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student used a DCF and reported valuation outputs (Discover/Implement) but never identifies or discusses FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor states that FCF represents cash available to providers of capital. Their own reflection notes the analysis lacked deeper explanation of the numbers, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly calculated a terminal value using the perpetual-growth method (WACC 9%, g = 2.5%), satisfying inclusion of a TV calculation. However, they did not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically composes the majority of a DCF's value or discuss its dominance; the reflection comments about wide ranges show awareness of gaps but not the required TV significance. Therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student distinguishes explicit forecast scenarios from a terminal period and cites a lower perpetual growth rate (2.5%) with a rationale (inflation/GDP proxy), and provides scenario revenue paths—showing correct conceptual treatment. However, the treatment lacks depth and calibration (no year-by-year growth schedule, limited justification for scenario rates and magnitudes), and the student themselves notes needing to narrow ranges; therefore the work demonstrates correct but incomplete multi-stage growth reasoning.",
