  "transcript": "0:01\nAll right. So this is my session 12\n0:03\nassignment. So the first thing we want\n0:05\nto do is define and discover. So when\n0:09\nlooking at the situation says deliver a\n0:11\nfull valuation of paneer bread for\n0:13\nperspective for a perspective KKR\n0:16\ntakeover using driver combine DCF\n0:19\ntrading comps and precedent transactions\n0:22\nto produce an informed bid range while\n0:25\nconstraining uh financial buyer\n0:28\ndiscipline with strategic buyer\n0:30\nstrategies.\n0:31\nSome important information is that the\n0:34\nscale they have $6 billion revenue\n0:36\ngrowing 8% a $900 million EBITDA\n0:41\n$400 million net income across 2100\n0:44\nstores digital sales is already up to\n0:46\n50%. Uh for market references, the\n0:49\nindustry PE ratio is uh 22x.\n0:55\nPrecedent EBITDA multiplies 12 to 15X.\n0:58\nChipotle which is in the same industry\n1:01\nand is kind of a competitor trades at 35\n1:04\ntimes the PU ratio. McDonald's at 25.\n1:08\nUh capital assumptions industry whack at\n1:11\n9%. management wants 10% rollover and\n1:14\nstrategic biders like Starbucks and\n1:16\nMcDonald's are circling and growth\n1:19\nlevers they have 500 new stores in five\n1:22\nyears digital mix to 70% and then their\n1:25\ndinner they have a dinner/catering\n1:28\nexpansion and early stage international\n1:31\nrollout\n1:33\nthen create an executive ready\n1:34\nrecommendation that sta that states your\n1:37\nvaluation range winning bid strategy and\n1:39\nrationale for choosing financial versus\n1:41\nstrategic IC positioning.\n1:44\nSo in terms of again going back to the\n1:46\ndefine and discover thing, there's\n1:48\nreally not too much to\n1:52\nat least ensure is true here because\n1:53\nit's a madeup scenario. Something I\n1:55\nwanted to do for the define stage was I\n1:56\nhad to look up what\n1:58\nI I've heard of KKR, but I wasn't 100%\n2:01\nsure what their business model was.\n2:02\nThey're a venture capital firm, so I\n2:05\nfigured that out. That's really kind of\n2:06\nwhat I did for the define and discover\n2:09\nstage. did not mean to do that.\n2:13\nSo then moving on to the represent\n2:18\nstage. Uh I have a really long prompt so\n2:23\nI don't fully want to go through it and\n2:26\nbut a little bit yeah it doesn't even\n2:28\nshow the full prompt but really most of\n2:30\nwhat the prompt was was uh\n2:34\njust really defining what this scenario\n2:36\nis making sure that I got all of the uh\n2:41\nrequired analysis into my calculator to\n2:44\nmake sure that it had everything I\n2:46\nneeded and then also I can talk about\n2:49\nthat later. Uh the next stage is the\n2:52\nimplement stage. So now I guess we can\n2:53\ngo look at this.\n2:58\nSo the first thing we want to look at is\n3:00\nthe discounted cash flow analysis for\n3:03\nthe whack justification that it used. Uh\n3:06\nit says in there that it was at 9% which\n3:08\nis the industry standard. So that's\n3:10\nwhere that got that from. and then the\n3:13\nuh perpetual growth of 2 and a half% it\n3:16\nused a long-term inflation\n3:19\nGDP proxy for terminal cash flows. So it\n3:22\nhas we have three scenarios here. We\n3:24\nhave the downside, the base scenario and\n3:26\nthen the upside. Uh the overall\n3:30\ndifference between them is\n3:33\nthe big thing you want to look at is the\n3:34\nrevenue. You can see that again the\n3:38\ndownside. So like the worst case or not\n3:40\nworst case scenario but like the bad\n3:41\nscenario you'd have a revenue of around\n3:43\n8.6 billion. For the base scenario you'd\n3:47\nhave a revenue of 9.4 billion. And then\n3:49\nfor the upside or like a good scenario\n3:52\nyou'd be at 10.1 billion.\n3:56\nSo that's kind of just looking at the uh\n3:59\nDCF analysis.\n4:02\nUh for the market multiples analysis.\n4:05\nThe first thing we looked at is\n4:08\ncomparable company analysis. So looking\n4:11\nat uh some of the other companies that\n4:16\nare in the same space as them\n4:20\nuh we can see that for a a low PE ratio\n4:25\nthe industry average was 22. So it' be\n4:28\n8.8 million. Then for a high PE ratio,\n4:33\nwhich is uh\n4:36\nsomething like what Chipotle has, they'd\n4:39\nbe at 14 billion.\n4:41\nAnd then for the precedent transactional\n4:44\nanalysis,\n4:46\nuh low multiple for the EBITDA would be\n4:51\n10.8 8 billion and then a high multiple\n4:53\nwould be 13 and a half\n4:57\nfor the financial versus strategic buyer\n5:01\nassessment.\n5:03\nuh there is potential\n5:05\nsynergies for a strategic buyer such as\n5:08\nstuff like supply chain optimization.\n5:11\nThen also for uh there would be a\n5:14\ncontrol premium because strategic buyers\n5:16\noften pay a premium estimated about 10%\n5:20\nover the standalone value.\n5:23\nuh when looking at the financial buyer\n5:26\nfocus which would have been the venture\n5:28\ncapital firm so KKR\n5:30\nuh their operational improvements\n5:33\nutilizing the base DCF value as the\n5:36\nprimary justification and then for the\n5:38\nstrategic buyer such as uh Starbucks or\n5:40\nMcDonald's\n5:42\nuh the maximum valuation could reach DCF\n5:45\nupside plus synergies plus the premium\n5:48\npotentially up to about just under 15\n5:51\nbillion.\n5:53\nAnd then for the management rollover\n5:56\nuh it aligns KKR and Panera on that part\n6:00\nof it. So that's something working for\n6:04\nthe uh financial buyer.\n6:08\nUh then for the valuation triangulation\n6:11\ntriangulation\n6:13\nsorry where the football field synthesis\n6:16\nuh\n6:18\nthe DCF or the downside would be this\n6:22\nshould all be in millions. Yeah. So that\n6:23\nwould be seven and a half billion. Uh\n6:28\nthe comps for a low P would be 8 8.8\n6:31\nbillion. The precedent for the low\n6:34\nEBITDA\n6:36\nwould be 10.8 8 billion. The DCF base\n6:40\nwould be 10.8 billion. The upside would\n6:43\nbe 13.4 billion. Then the precedent or a\n6:47\nhigh EB\n6:49\nuh ITDA would be 13.5 billion. And then\n6:53\nthe\n6:55\ncomparison with a high P ratio such as\n6:59\nChipotle be 14 billion. So then this\n7:02\nkind of leads us to the overall\n7:04\nvaluation spread. It's pretty uh wide,\n7:08\nbut it's anywhere from 7 and a half\n7:10\nbillion to 14 billion, which then leads\n7:13\nus to the recommended bid range for KKR,\n7:17\nwhich should be 10.8 billion up to 14.8\n7:21\nbillion. So, that's kind of what we have\n7:25\noverall for the implement stage.\n7:29\nFor the validate stage, uh I just looked\n7:32\nthrough all of this to make sure that it\n7:33\nwas pulling the numbers correctly. And\n7:35\nso far from what I can tell it is. So\n7:37\nthat's most of what I did for the\n7:39\nvalidate stage. But also it looks like\n7:41\nall of the calculations it made were\n7:43\ncorrect.\n7:44\nAnd then for the evolve stage something\n7:48\nI deleted the other part but something I\n7:49\ndid try to add was sections like this\n7:53\nwhere it gives more indepth explanation.\n7:56\nMy first go through of this, it was just\n7:58\ngiving me straight up numbers, which is\n8:00\nuseful, but you also kind of want to\n8:02\nvisualize and give a little more\n8:04\nin-depth explanation as to what the\n8:06\nnumbers mean and why the numbers are\n8:08\nimportant.\n8:10\nSo that's something I did for the evolve\n8:12\nstage. And then for the reflect stage,\n8:15\npotentially looking at\n8:17\nthings I could add is\n8:21\nin the actual scenario, I'd probably\n8:23\nlook at\n8:26\nI'd probably look at a more broad set of\n8:30\ninformation if that makes sense. Such as\n8:33\nI'd probably add more market information\n8:35\ninto it than just what we have. And I'd\n8:38\nprobably do\n8:40\na little bit more uh risk analysis going\n8:44\nboth ways. I'd also do a little bit of\n8:47\nwork to try to narrow down some of the\n8:48\nranges because obviously that is quite a\n8:51\nlarge range. So, I think going into the\n8:53\nfuture, those are things that I would\n8:54\npotentially\n8:56\nchange. But yeah, that's about it. Thank\n8:59you."
