  "transcript": "All right. So, for my session 12\nassignment, I was focusing on using\nGemini and Python to build a full\nvaluation of Panera Bread for a\npotential KKR takeover. The objective is\ndetermine what Panera is realistically\nworth, compare financial buyer\ndiscipline with strategic buyer\nsynergies, and recommend a smart bidding\nrange. Uh, Panera generates about 900\nmillion in EBITDA,\nearnings before interest, taxes, etc.\n400 million in net income and operates\n2100 stores which gives us a solid base\nfor valuation.\nSo to to support the model I collected\nthem or I collect I pulled the market\ndata from our assignment and operating\nassumptions that drive valuation. The\nrestaurant industry trades about 22 PE\nwith Chipotle at 35 and McDonald's at 25\nwhile president deals typically fall\nbetween 12 to 15 earning like EBITDA.\nPaneer's growth plan includes 500 new\nstores in 5 years, digital sales rising\ntowards 70% and expansion to dinner\ncatering in early international markets.\nFor discounting, I used the base uh WACC\nof 9%, an upside of 8% and a downside of\n10% which are all adjustable inside the\nPython model as you can see. And as you\ncan see at the side here, you can see\nthe current earnings before interest uh\ntaxes etc of 900 million, the net income\nof 400 million, the perpetual growth\nrate, the tax rate.\nUm so and like I said, I organized the\nthe analysis into a simple valuation\nstack. First build a three scenario DCF\nas you can see scenario\nscenario one or scenario two\nand\nuh run training comps and president\ntransactions. Third estimate the value\nstrategic buyers may unlock through\nsynergies and finally use all three\napproaches to try triangulate a clean\nvaluation range. This outline kept my\ncode modular and made the scenarios easy\nto toggle.\nAs you can see the number three,\nnumber two and the first one which is\nthe base financial metrics. Uh so the\nPython model auto automates the entire\nvaluation. It projects 5 years of\nrevenue growth based on new store\nopenings and applies gradual margin\nexpansion.\nUh the EBITDA flows into the no free\nclash flow and then discounted values\nfor each scenario.\nThe terminal value comes from the uh\nGordon growth model. Uh the DCF results\nwere clear. The base case is about 10.95\nbillion. Upside is around 15.6 billion\nand downside is about 8.1 billion. I\ncross check these with market comps uh\nwhich point to 10.8 billion and\nprecedent transactions which suggest\nsuggest around 12.15 billion. As you can\nsee right here,\nI also added a simple 1 billion synergy\ncredit to estimate a strategic buyer max\nvaluation of roughly 11.95 billion.\nUm,\nto test the model sensitivity, I varied\nthe WACC from 8.5% to 10% which moved\nthe valuation between 11.88\nbillion and 9 uh 9.46 billion.\nAnd these are a lot of numbers and it's\ngood to know what the what these results\ntell us. And across all methods, DFC\ncomps, presidents, and synergies, the\nnumbers form a constant consistent\nvaluation band. The base case aligns\ntightly with trading multiples and the\npresident multiples support the higher\nend of the range. The sensitivity test\nconfirms the valuation is most affected\nby the by the WACC. But e but even then\nthe realistic band holds together.\nTogether these checks show that the DCF\nassumptions are reasonable and that all\nthe final values are credible.\nTurn uh in our evolve section of the\ndriver format. I want to try to turn in\nthe model to a bid strategy. So for\nexample, since the KKR is a financial\nbuyer, the valuation needs to emphasize\ndiscipline. Financial buyers can't\ncapture the same synergies as Starbucks\nor McDonald's. So KKR's realistic values\non sits between the 10.5 billion and the\n11 billion with only little limited\nupside.\nStrategic buyers may justify paying\ncloser to 12 billion, but only because\nof the synergy capture. The difference\nshapes how KKR should approach\nnegotiations and reinforces that\noverpaying into the strategic range\nwould be risky.\nAnd yeah, uh, from my reflection based\non all the drivers, I think the\nrecommended bid range for KKR is\nobviously the 10.95 to 12.15 with a\npractical ceiling of around 11.5\nbillion, which includes the modest\ncontrol premium, but avoids entering the\nstrategic buyer zone. The best strategy\nis to emphasize operational improvement,\ndigital scale, partnership with\nmanagement while staying disciplined.\nUm,\nand\nyeah, that's my assignment. I'm\nI like all the visual representation and\nyeah, um, thank you."
