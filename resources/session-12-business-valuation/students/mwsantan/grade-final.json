  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs a DCF (projecting cash flows into free cash flow and discounting them) and applies a WACC-based discount rate with sensitivity analysis. The discussion includes implementation details (Gordon terminal, scenario DCFs, specific WACC values and resulting valuations), demonstrating a thorough introductory-level grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected relevant public peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and cited specific PE and precedent EBITDA multiple ranges, then applied those comps to produce a comparable valuation (10.8B) and reconcile with precedent-based value (12.15B). Coverage is specific and applied within their DRIVER workflow, meeting the introductory comparable methodology standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission compares multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions, and a synergy-adjusted strategic value), performs sensitivity testing (WACC range), and explicitly triangulates results into a recommended range. The analysis is specific with numeric outcomes and a clear judgment about the most reasonable bidding band, meeting the thoroughness expected for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual links—EBITDA → free cash flow and discounting with WACC (implying cash to capital providers)—but does not explicitly identify key FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT, depreciation, CapEx, ΔWorking Capital) or show how each is calculated/adjusted. This is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value calculation using the Gordon growth model (Implement evidence) and integrates it into the DCF and final valuation (Discover/Reflect). However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast period and a separate terminal period (Gordon growth), and provides operational drivers that justify stronger near-term growth. However, they do not state specific short-term vs. long-term growth rate figures or a terminal/perpetual growth rate magnitude, so the treatment is conceptually correct but not sufficiently detailed for a full PASS.",
