  "transcript": "1\n00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,440\nHello, I'm Brock and for our session 12\n\n2\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,400\nassignment, it's going to be over\n\n3\n00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,040\nbusiness valuation. So, uh we have to\n\n4\n00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,880\ndeliver a full valuation of Panera Bread\n\n5\n00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,039\nfor a prospective uh KKR takeover using\n\n6\n00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760\nDriver. So, we're going to combine the\n\n7\n00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,000\ndiscounted cash flow, trading comps, and\n\n8\n00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880\nprecedent transactions to produce an\n\n9\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560\ninformed bid range while also\n\n10\n00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,920\ncontrasting financial buyer discipline\n\n11\n00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,640\nwith strategic buyer synergies.\n\n12\n00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,399\nSo, the deal snapshot is the scale of it\n\n13\n00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,239\nis going to be $6 billion revenue\n\n14\n00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200\ngrowing 8%.\n\n15\n00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,920\nUm, we have $900 million earnings before\n\n16\n00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,719\ninterest minus the taxes and\n\n17\n00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,160\ndepreciation, which is 15% margin. We\n\n18\n00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,719\nhave a 400 million net income across um\n\n19\n00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280\n2100 stores and then digital sales are\n\n20\n00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,800\nalready at 50%. And then we got the\n\n21\n00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,559\nmarket reference is the industry uh\n\n22\n00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,600\npriced earnings multiple which is 22x.\n\n23\n00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,560\nWe got the president's EBITDA\n\n24\n00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,880\nmultiple is 12 to 15% or not percent\n\n25\n00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,680\nsorry x and chipotle trades at 35x and\n\n26\n00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,880\nMcDonald's at 25x. So the capital\n\n27\n00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,880\nassumptions is an in industry um\n\n28\n00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,360\nWACCC at 9% management wants a 10%\n\n29\n00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,000\nrollover strategic biders is Starbucks\n\n30\n00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,400\nMcDonald's they're all circling and then\n\n31\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200\nthe growth levers 500 new stores in 5\n\n32\n00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600\nyears digital mix of 70% a\n\n33\n00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360\ndinner/catering expansion option and\n\n34\n00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000\nthen an early stage international roll\n\n35\n00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,600\nout. So our objective today is to create\n\n36\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,920\nan executive ready recommendation that\n\n37\n00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360\nstates your valuation range, winning bid\n\n38\n00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,439\nstrategy and rational for choosing\n\n39\n00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,000\nfinancial versus strategic positioning.\n\n40\n00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,479\nSo some requirements is it's going to\n\n41\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,320\nbuild a multien um discounted cash flow\n\n42\n00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,799\nwith a base upside and downside with\n\n43\n00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,960\n5year operating projections.\n\n44\n00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,960\nfree cash flow detail um weighted\n\n45\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360\nweighted average cost of capital\n\n46\n00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760\njustification and a terminal value\n\n47\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440\nsupport and it's going to run a\n\n48\n00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440\ncomparable company and precedent\n\n49\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000\ntransaction analysis using defensible\n\n50\n00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,520\npeer sets articulate the multiples used\n\n51\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560\ntranslate them to valuation ranges for\n\n52\n00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720\nPanera assess financial buyer versus\n\n53\n00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,160\nstrategic buyer perspectives and then\n\n54\n00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200\ntriangulate approaches via football\n\n55\n00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,599\nfield uh table and then we're going to\n\n56\n00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,800\nbe using Python to do So let's get right\n\n57\n00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,480\ninto it. So for the before we actually\n\n58\n00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,160\nget into it, let's talk about what this\n\n59\n00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080\nis. So for um D and our driver, it's\n\n60\n00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,920\ndesign. So our goal is to estimate what\n\n61\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400\nPanera Bread is worth and decide how\n\n62\n00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,360\nmuch a buyer like KKR should be willing\n\n63\n00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920\nto pay. They generate around $6 billion\n\n64\n00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800\nin annual sales, roughly 900 million in\n\n65\n00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,360\nuh EBITDA, and it's still growing, which\n\n66\n00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800\nmakes it a realistic acquisition target.\n\n67\n00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,400\nAnd the objective is use multiple\n\n68\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920\nvaluation methods. So the final decision\n\n69\n00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720\nis not just based on one singular\n\n70\n00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,599\nnumber.\n\n71\n00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519\nSo uh for R represent three valuation\n\n72\n00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920\nmethods are used in understanding the\n\n73\n00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239\nvalue from different angles. We can get\n\n74\n00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840\num couple numbers. So we're going to be\n\n75\n00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159\nusing our discounted cash flow which\n\n76\n00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760\nestimates value based on the cash the\n\n77\n00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120\nbusiness can generate in the future.\n\n78\n00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959\nWe're going to be using trading comps\n\n79\n00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360\nwhich show how similar public companies\n\n80\n00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,720\nare priced by investors. And the\n\n81\n00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799\npresident transaction would show what\n\n82\n00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,599\nbuyers have paid in the past restaurant\n\n83\n00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,280\ndeals. And then together these methods\n\n84\n00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,280\ncreate a reasonable valuation method\n\n85\n00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,720\nrange. Sorry.\n\n86\n00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280\nSo let's get into it. So what I did was\n\n87\n00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,720\nI said write me code using AI for collab\n\n88\n00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959\nfor this question. There's the question.\n\n89\n00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,720\nI put the deal snapshots in there.\n\n90\n00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799\nFinancial analysis and then technical\n\n91\n00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080\nrequirements. And then at the end of the\n\n92\n00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159\ncode, give me analysis that goes over\n\n93\n00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,599\neach financial requirement as well as an\n\n94\n00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,519\nexecutive ready recommendation that\n\n95\n00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,439\nstates all three options.\n\n96\n00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,799\nSo that produced this code right here. I\n\n97\n00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,480\nthink I already ran it.\n\n98\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,599\nYep.\n\n99\n00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,120\nSo at the top we got the inputs.\n\n100\n00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,759\nObviously all the inputs. You can change\n\n101\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,479\nthese if you have different rates.\n\n102\n00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,040\nWe got the DCF mechanics market\n\n103\n00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,360\nreferences and then we got the scenario\n\n104\n00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880\ndefinitions for the five-year operating\n\n105\n00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520\nprojections. So we got the downside, the\n\n106\n00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520\nbase and the upside. All of that inputed\n\n107\n00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,040\ninto here.\n\n108\n00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440\nAnd then we got the helper functions,\n\n109\n00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,160\nthe DCF plus the projections of each of\n\n110\n00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,560\nthese. And that leads into the revenue\n\n111\n00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479\npath, EBITDA.\n\n112\n00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,960\nThis is all the calculations. ABIT and\n\n113\n00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,800\ntaxes, working capital, unlevered FCF.\n\n114\n00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,960\nKeep going down here. We got the comps\n\n115\n00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,960\nand presidents.\n\n116\n00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,040\nAnd then we got the synergy lens.\n\n117\n00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720\nAnd then we got the multiple scenario\n\n118\n00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,880\nthat puts every single different\n\n119\n00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,840\nscenario into this either whether that's\n\n120\n00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,840\ndownside, base, or upside.\n\n121\n00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759\nWhere was I at?\n\n122\n00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,240\nWe got the sensitivity here with the\n\n123\n00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520\nterminal growth. So how much is going to\n\n124\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280\nchange and then the football field\n\n125\n00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199\nanalysis\n\n126\n00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,280\nbid strategy as well as the required\n\n127\n00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,240\nwrite up. So let's get into that.\n\n128\n00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,560\nSo for our discounted cash flow summary\n\n129\n00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,680\nwhich is the um enterprise value plus\n\n130\n00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,320\nthe equity. So for the scenario the\n\n131\n00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,680\ndiscounted cash flow\n\n132\n00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,919\nof the base is going to be9 billion\n\n133\n00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759\nalmost $10 billion\n\n134\n00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,280\ndownside is going to be about $7.7\n\n135\n00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919\nbillion and the upside is going to be\n\n136\n00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,000\nabout $12.3 billion\n\n137\n00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,680\nand for the equity it's around 8.4 6.2 2\n\n138\n00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,680\nand then 10.7 respectively.\n\n139\n00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759\nAnd then we got the present value of\n\n140\n00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,199\nexplicit FCF and the present value of\n\n141\n00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,880\nterminal terminal value and then the\n\n142\n00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,160\nstrategic synergy of um enterprise value\n\n143\n00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,160\nas well as the strategic synergy equity.\n\n144\n00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,240\nSo the base scenario five-year\n\n145\n00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880\nprojections. So for year one the revenue\n\n146\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160\nis going to be around 6.4 billion. The\n\n147\n00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880\nrevenue for year 2 is going to be around\n\n148\n00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,680\nalmost 7 billion and then 7.5 billion,\n\n149\n00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,800\n8.1 billion and then 8.8 billion. So as\n\n150\n00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,199\nyou can see the revenue is growing and\n\n151\n00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680\nthe um\n\n152\n00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,639\nearnings before interest\n\n153\n00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,400\nin the millions is 792 1 billion 1.1 1.2\n\n154\n00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,360\n1.4\n\n155\n00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,560\nand respectively this is also going up\n\n156\n00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,560\nand as well as unlevered FCF.\n\n157\n00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,000\nSo, here is the trading comps part of\n\n158\n00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,080\nit, which um we're going to be doing\n\n159\n00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,840\nMcDonald's and Chipotle with the 25 and\n\n160\n00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,919\nand 35. So, we got the industry\n\n161\n00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000\nuh price per earnings multiple, which is\n\n162\n00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,680\n22x, and then the McDonald's price per\n\n163\n00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080\nearnings multiple is 25x, and then\n\n164\n00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440\nChipotle with 35x.\n\n165\n00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,960\nAnd as you can see, Chipotle has a um\n\n166\n00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,759\n$15 billion enterprise value and also\n\n167\n00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,759\nthe most equity value.\n\n168\n00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840\nSo, it looks like McDonald's and\n\n169\n00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,560\nChipotle are doing better, but obviously\n\n170\n00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,080\nthis is still competing\n\n171\n00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,919\nwith these higher chains.\n\n172\n00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,639\nAnd then we got the enterprise value for\n\n173\n00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,120\nthe low is going to be 12, mid 13.5 and\n\n174\n00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,280\nhigh is be 15.\n\n175\n00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,919\nAnd this is the sensitivity values with\n\n176\n00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,039\nuh weighted average\n\n177\n00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:53,120\nwith the 0.08, 0.09 and then 10\n\n178\n00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,720\nrespected with the 0.02.03 and 04. As\n\n179\n00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,280\nyou can see the um\n\n180\n00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720\nweighted average cost of the capital is\n\n181\n00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,240\ngoing to be highest with the sensitivity\n\n182\n00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,319\nshoot\n\n183\n00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,280\nwith the sensitivity being 0.04 and then\n\n184\n00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,639\n0.08.\n\n185\n00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,879\nThis is for the enterprise and then this\n\n186\n00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,680\nis for the equity. It looks like it's\n\n187\n00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199\nalso the same same way with this. This\n\n188\n00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800\none is going to be the lowest and this\n\n189\n00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,080\none's going to be the highest. As you\n\n190\n00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,080\ncan see in this chart, the\n\n191\n00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440\nbrighter the color is, the more uh\n\n192\n00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,039\nenterprise value it has.\n\n193\n00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,400\nSo the this is the football field\n\n194\n00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080\nsummary. I'll get back to that in a\n\n195\n00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,320\nsecond.\n\n196\n00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,800\nGot the bid guidance here. So our walk\n\n197\n00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,560\naway enterprise value for KKR is going\n\n198\n00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,080\nto be 12 um.2\n\n199\n00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,599\nbillion.\n\n200\n00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519\nSo that's how much that we're not going\n\n201\n00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,320\nto take it. Our target bid is going to\n\n202\n00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,399\nbe 10.8 billion. And then with the ris\n\n203\n00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,399\nthe risk um our strategic is going to be\n\n204\n00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,399\n11.3\n\n205\n00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880\nand that's the same thing with this but\n\n206\n00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,519\nthis is just includes the management\n\n207\n00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,279\nrollover.\n\n208\n00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920\nLooks like a walk away is going to have\n\n209\n00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,360\nthe most impact.\n\n210\n00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,519\nSo and then we got the model write up\n\n211\n00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,440\nand executive recommendation. So number\n\n212\n00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,320\none the multi scenario um DCF with the\n\n213\n00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,000\n5year projections the downside\n\n214\n00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,320\ndiscounted cash flow is 7.7\n\n215\n00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480\nbillion the base is going to be around\n\n216\n00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,640\n$10 billion and then the upside is going\n\n217\n00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:35,560\nto be around 12.2 billion with a base uh\n\n218\n00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,560\nPV of 2.2 two a terminal value of 7.7\n\n219\n00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,600\nthe WACCC use is going to be 9% with a\n\n220\n00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,959\nterminal growth is 3%. So if we look\n\n221\n00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,760\nright here we have terminal growth of 3%\n\n222\n00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:52,880\n9%. So, it's it's this one right here.\n\n223\n00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,640\nAnd then the trading comp um analysis,\n\n224\n00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,040\nthe trading comp's EV range is going to\n\n225\n00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,440\nbe from 10.3 billion to 15.5 billion.\n\n226\n00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,000\nAnd that is from the industry 22X and\n\n227\n00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,160\nMcDonald's 25 and Chipotle applied to\n\n228\n00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,680\nthe 400 million net income.\n\n229\n00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,399\nAnd then we got the present transaction\n\n230\n00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,519\nanalysis is 10.8 8 to 13.5 when this has\n\n231\n00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,920\nthe 12x15x applied.\n\n232\n00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,320\nAnd this one is\n\n233\n00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,000\na base estimated synergy of 2.6.\n\n234\n00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,279\nThe risk 50% and strategic rationalized\n\n235\n00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,279\num risk adjusted is 9.9\n\n236\n00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,600\nto 11.2\n\n237\n00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,320\n11.3 sorry. So with all of those in\n\n238\n00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920\nconsideration,\n\n239\n00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680\nactually let's go back to our football\n\n240\n00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519\nfield example. So the football field\n\n241\n00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,760\nchart shows the low, mid, high ranges\n\n242\n00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,320\nfor each one of the values we're going\n\n243\n00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,399\nto be looking at. So you can see that\n\n244\n00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,120\nthe DCF and synergy has the most um\n\n245\n00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,760\nvariation. The presidents has the least\n\n246\n00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,279\nvariation and then the DCF and then or\n\n247\n00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,279\nyeah, the DCF and then the training\n\n248\n00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,279\ncomps.\n\n249\n00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,399\nSo\n\n250\n00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,120\nour recommendation is the recommended\n\n251\n00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:18,560\nKKR valuation range is going to be\n\n252\n00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:21,360\nbetween $10.8 billion and 12.23 billion.\n\n253\n00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,279\nThe target bid that we're looking for is\n\n254\n00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,839\nlow on the lower end obviously because\n\n255\n00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120\nwe're trying to get the most uh we're\n\n256\n00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240\ntrying to get we're trying to save the\n\n257\n00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,680\nmost money on this bid. So it's $10.8 8\n\n258\n00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,800\nbillion with the KKK walk away price is\n\n259\n00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,519\n12.2. Obviously that matches here\n\n260\n00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560\nbecause the valuation range if they go\n\n261\n00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,399\nout of it they're obviously going to\n\n262\n00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,160\nwalk away. So that's going to be the\n\n263\n00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,800\nhighest they'll go. And then the\n\n264\n00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,440\nstrategic ceiling for risk adjusted is\n\n265\n00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360\n11.35.\n\n266\n00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240\nSo the winning bid strategy we have here\n\n267\n00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,920\nis to anchor to the discounted cash\n\n268\n00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,200\nvalue in present multiples. do not pay\n\n269\n00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,920\nfull synergy value. Use fast close turns\n\n270\n00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,040\npitch with a 10% management rollover\n\n271\n00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,880\nuh so you don't overpay. And\n\n272\n00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,079\nif strategic biders go above the walk\n\n273\n00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,639\naway, use synergy stories and protect\n\n274\n00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,079\nthe sponsor returns. And then the\n\n275\n00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240\ndifference between strategic versus\n\n276\n00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,680\nfinancial positioning. Financial buyer\n\n277\n00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839\nwins uncertainty structure and\n\n278\n00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,079\ndisciplined price tag to cash flow and\n\n279\n00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920\nstrategic buyer can justify a higher\n\n280\n00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,120\nceiling from synergies but faces that\n\n281\n00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,760\nrisk involved in it.\n\n282\n00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,720\nSo let's go back to here now that we got\n\n283\n00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880\nthat out of the way. We got the\n\n284\n00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,279\nimplement 5-year DCF downside slower\n\n285\n00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800\ngrowth lower value base case expected\n\n286\n00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,639\nperformance mid-range value and then\n\n287\n00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,200\nupside case is what we want strong\n\n288\n00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,519\nexecution higher buying\n\n289\n00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,240\nand respectively 7.7 10 and 12.2 too\n\n290\n00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680\nwith the market comparisons uh support\n\n291\n00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720\nthese results. The trading comp suggests\n\n292\n00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,760\na value between 10.3 and 15.5 meaning\n\n293\n00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,360\ninvestors pay for high quality brands\n\n294\n00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,519\nand the deals suggest 10.8 to 13.5\n\n295\n00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399\nshowing what they actually have\n\n296\n00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,880\nhistorically paid in the past for these.\n\n297\n00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,120\nSo validate the base ECF uh results line\n\n298\n00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,720\nup closely with present transactions\n\n299\n00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,200\nwhich suggest the valuation is\n\n300\n00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800\nreasonable and sensitivity analysis\n\n301\n00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,000\nshows that changes in assumptions like\n\n302\n00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,639\nrisk and long-term growth can move um a\n\n303\n00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,200\nvalue either into higher or lower cavity\n\n304\n00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120\ncategory which is why ranges are more\n\n305\n00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360\nreliable than one number. So a few\n\n306\n00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,639\nranges are more reliable and then\n\n307\n00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,399\nevolve. Um we can improve this by\n\n308\n00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,200\nincluding assumptions such as store\n\n309\n00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,880\nlevel growth or international expansion\n\n310\n00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,040\nand then reflect combining all the\n\n311\n00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,920\nmethods.
