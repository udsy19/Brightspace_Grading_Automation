  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines DCF as the present value of future cash generation, explicitly calculates PV of explicit FCF and terminal value across downside/base/upside scenarios, and applies a WACC (9%) and terminal growth (3%) as the discounting assumptions. Combined with implemented code, scenario analysis, and sensitivity discussion, this demonstrates a thorough introductory treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed a terminal value using a terminal growth assumption (3%) and WACC (9%) and reported PV breakdown (explicit FCF ~2.2 vs terminal ~7.7), demonstrating that terminal value drives the bulk of enterprise value. They also ran sensitivity on terminal growth and discussed how terminal assumptions affect valuation ranges, showing thorough conceptual and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5‑year forecast (explicit projections) from a terminal value and reports PVs for each, and uses a higher near‑term growth hypothesis (e.g., ~8% / multi‑year revenue growth) with a lower implied long‑term/terminal assumption (terminal growth/WACC sensitivity discussed). This demonstrates a clear, reasonable multi‑stage growth approach with sensitivity testing, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references key FCF elements (EBIT/EBITDA & taxes, depreciation, working capital, and unlevered FCF) and uses a DCF framework indicating awareness that cash flows drive enterprise value. However CapEx is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript and the treatment is descriptive rather than fully detailed, so the understanding is correct but not demonstrated with comprehensive, explicit component coverage — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student produced both enterprise value and corresponding equity-value figures, indicating they performed an EV→Equity bridge in practice, but they did not explicitly document subtracting Net Debt (Debt less Cash) nor did they show dividing Equity Value by share count to get Price Per Share. Wording also shows some conceptual imprecision (\"enterprise value plus the equity\"), so the demonstration is correct but incomplete.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student compares their DCF outputs to trading comps and precedent transactions and discusses sensitivity, showing external validation conceptually (Validate + Represent stages). However they do not name specific external sources, tools, or transaction examples (websites/calculators/identified deals), so this falls short of the PASS requirement and is a PARTIAL.",
