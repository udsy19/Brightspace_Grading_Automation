  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly treats DCF as the present value of future free cash flows (shows PV of FCFF and terminal value) and uses a WACC (9%) to discount cash flows, including sensitivity analysis around WACC. The numeric outputs and validation steps demonstrate a thorough, introductory-level mastery of the DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly computes terminal value using the perpetuity growth method with numeric TV and PV figures and contrasts PV(FCFF) vs PV(TV). The sensitivity analysis calling out terminal growth as the \"single greatest driver of value\" demonstrates awareness that TV typically dominates enterprise value. These elements collectively show a thorough, correct treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast from a separate terminal period and uses plausible multi-stage assumptions (8%→4% short-term deceleration, 3% terminal growth). They also perform sensitivity analysis on terminal growth, demonstrating depth and reasonableness in multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models and reports FCFF (including NOPAT) and uses it to derive enterprise value and bridge to equity, showing understanding that FCF drives value to capital providers. However, they do not explicitly identify standard FCFF components (depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or detail their treatment, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes net debt as the bridge from EV to Equity Value, showing conceptual and implementation evidence, but the transcript contains no explicit mention of dividing Equity Value by share count to derive Price Per Share. Thus the criterion is only partially met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies WACC as the discount/hurdle rate for FCFF and provides a sensitivity check (validating 9% against an 8–10% range), showing conceptual defensibility. However, they do not show a detailed/calculated derivation or benchmarking of the 9% WACC (e.g., CAPM inputs or industry comparables), so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",
