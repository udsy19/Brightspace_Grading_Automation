  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Clara Weinzapfel, and\ntoday I'm going to be going over the\nsession 12 assignment. So, I started in\nthe textbook with the assignment\noverview and reading through the whole\nthing. Then, I copy and pasted it into\nGoogle Gemini and had it create for me a\nPython code and help me complete the\nassignment.\nI was then able to troubleshoot any\nproblems I was having with the code and\ncopy and paste it into Google Collab\nwhere I got to run the code. So this\npresentation delivers a full valuation\nof Panera Bread for a prospective KKR\ntakeover structured using the driver\nanalytical framework. The objective is\nto produce a disciplined bid range by\ncontrasting the financial buyers focus\non standalone cash flow with the\nstrategic buyers focus on synergies.\nSo we begin by defining the core inputs\nand assumptions used to parameterize the\nPython model. The company scale is\ndefined by a $6 billion\nin FYO\nrevenue.\nThe\nEBITDA\nmargin of 15% and a 400 million dollar\nin net income.\nKey valuation parameters are set. The\nWACC\nis 9% and the long-term terminal growth\nrate is 3%. We assume a placeholder\none\nwe assume a placeholder of $1,000\nmillion net debt\nto bridge enterprise value to equity\nvalue.\nAnd then moving down the code, the DCF\nmodel uses a 5-year projection,\nour base case revenue growth decelerates\nfrom 8% to 4%.\nAnd here the code is showing all the\ninputs for the define and discover stage\nof driver.\nAll the variables are defined here.\nAnd now for the represent implement\nstate.\nSo the Python model implements three\ncore methods. One\nis a multi- scenario DCF\nbased and strategic.\nTwo is comparable company analysis using\na P over E range of 22.0X\nto 25.0X.\nAnd three, precedent transaction\nanalysis using an EBITDA\nrange of 12.0X to 15.0X.\nAnd now we look at the calculate DCF\nblock.\nSo number one the DCF model which is the\nbase case. We first execute the DCF for\nthe base case representing the value\nfloor for KKR the financial buyer. This\nmodel assumes Panera origin\norganically\nexpands its EBITDA\nmargin to 17.5%\nby year five.\nThe discounted cash flow calculation\nyields a 5-year present value of FCFF\ntotaling 2,253\nmillion. And these values will be in the\nsummary section at the bottom which we\nwill get to.\nAnd then the terminal value calculated\nusing the perpetuity growth method at 3%\nresults in a TV of $6,27\nmillion and a present value of TV of\n$3,921\nmillion. The sum of these components\nestablishes the base case enterprise\nvalue at 6,174\nmillion.\nAnd then for number two, strategic buyer\nDCF.\nNext, we model the strategic buyer\nperspective. The strategic case\nassumes additional synergy capture\npushing the EBITDA\nmargin to 20 20.5%\nby year 5. This results in a synergized\nenterprise value of 6,664\nmillion. The difference between the\nstrategic EV and the base EV quantifies\nthe total present value of synergies at\n$490 million.\nThis is the incremental value of a\nsynergistic bidder\ncould realize their operational\nefficiencies like store overlap and\nsupply chain savings.\nAnd now for number three, comparable and\npresident transactions table. The market\nmultiplies\nthe market multiples provide context for\nthe DCF\nprecedent transactions\nimplies an EV range of 1,080 million to\n1,350 million reflecting historic but\noften lower valuations.\nAnd then comparable companies implies an\nEV range of 9,800 million to 11,000\nmillion. This range is inflated by high\ngrowth, high multiple peers like\nMcDonald's indicating a potential\nceiling.\nSo here in the code\nit shows projections the net operating\nprofit after t tax\nfree cash flow to firm present value of\nFCFF\nterminal value using perpetuity growth\nmethod and enterprise value. It then\ngoes on to do\nthe EBITDA valuation for enterprise\nvalue, the P over E valuation for equity\nvalue and converts the P over E equity\nvalue to enterprise value for synthesis.\nAnd now moving on to the validate stage\nof the driver formula.\nWe validate the base case EV by\nperforming a sensitivity analysis on the\ntwo most impactful variables WACCC and\nterminal growth.\nSo for WACC\nverifying this from 8% to 10% creates an\nEV fluctuation of approximately $1\nbillion.\nThis confirms the 9% WACC results in a\nreasonable midpoint.\nVarying terminal growth from 2% to 4%\nalso results in a significant\nfluctuation ranging from 5,579\nmillion to 6,985\nmillion. This highlights that long-term\nexecution is the single greatest driver\nof value.\nAnd continuing on it shows the\nsensitivity inputs create\nsensitivity data frame\nand then we move on to evolve.\nWe now synthesize the evaluation outputs\ninto the football field view. We discard\nthe extreme low and the high ranges from\nthe precedent and cop multiples\nrespectively and anchor the range on our\nDCF scenarios. The analysis confirms the\nmost robust range is defined by the base\ncase DCF and the strategic case DCF.\nThe difference between the financial\nversus strategic buyer assessment\ndefines the bidding conflict. The\nfinancial buyer\nKKR\ndriven by the $6,174\nmillion standalone FCF value at the 9%\nhurdle rate. And the strategic buyer is\ndriven by the 6,664\nmillion synergistic value justified by\nthe 490 million present value of\nintegration benefits.\nAnd we can see the Python code showing\nthe football field synthesis data, the\nKKR bid recommendation range. And then\nwe move on to the driver stage of\nreflect.\nOur recommendation for KKR is a\ndisciplined hybrid bid. The\nrecommendation enterprise value bid\nrange is $6,000 483 million to $6,598\nmillion.\nThis range implies an EBITDA\nmultiple of 14.4 4 times to 14.7 times.\nA competitive premium over the precedent\nmaximum of 15 times but still below the\nstrategic value ceiling.\nFor bid strategy and rationale, the\nwalkway price or floor the base case DCF\nEV of 6,174\nmillion.\nAnd talking about the negotiation,\nKKR should leverage the 10% management\nrollover to reduce the immediate cash\nequity requirement and secure management\nalignment for growth execution.\nand another negotiation.\nThe bid maximum is set at a discount to\nthe strategic ceiling, ensuring KKR\ncaptures a margin of the $490 million\nsynergy value for their expected exit.\nSo as you can see here in this\nis working in the Python code to create\nthe table.\nWe have the final recommendation and\nrationale here. And now we get to the\noutput which I can show now. So we have\nthe DCF model base case\nwith all the outputs here.\nThe valuation summary and strategic\nsynergies\nare shown here. Here we have comparable\nand precedent transactions. We have the\nsensitivity analysis, the valuation\nsynthesis which is the football field\ndata\nand we have the executive recommendation\nwhich we just went over which was\ndisciplined hybrid.\nIn conclusion, the recommended range\nprovides necessary competitive premium\nto win the deal while maintaining the\nfinancial discipline required of a\nsophisticated financial buyer. And that\nis the end of session 12 assignment.Thank you."
