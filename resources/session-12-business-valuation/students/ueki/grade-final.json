  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly proxies future free cash flows and runs a DCF using stated discount rates (9% financial, 8% strategic) and terminal growth assumptions, producing concrete valuation outputs—showing applied understanding beyond a mere mention. This meets the introductory DCF criterion with thorough, applied examples.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selects relevant comparables and applies both a P/E-style industry multiple and precedent EV/EBITDA multiples to stated company metrics, producing concrete value outcomes and ranges. These actions in the Discover and Implement stages demonstrate a thorough, correct application of the introductory comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly ran and compared multiple valuation methods (trading comps, precedent transactions, DCF) and produced numeric ranges from each. They discussed reasonableness by distinguishing financial vs strategic buyers, setting discipline and strategic ranges, and selecting a midpoint target, demonstrating a thorough triangulation and sensitivity assessment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding of cash-based valuation by running a DCF and using WACC inputs, but they do not explicitly identify FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT-after-tax, depreciation, CapEx, working capital). Their proxy (1.25× net income) is a simplistic conversion rather than a clear FCF construction, so the treatment is correct in intent but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the DCF uses the \"golden growth\" (Gordon) model and defined a long-term growth rate, indicating a terminal-value method was included (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT). However, they do not show an explicit terminal value calculation nor acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student sets a reasonable terminal growth (3%) and ties growth justification to business drivers, and applies it in the DCF (Implement). However, they do not specify an explicit forecast (explicit) period or higher short-term growth assumptions vs the terminal rate, so the multi-stage growth reasoning is present but incomplete.",
