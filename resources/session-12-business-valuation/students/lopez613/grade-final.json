  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the intrinsic valuation approach, cites detailed modeling assumptions (growth, margin, reinvestment), specifies a 9% WACC and 2.5% terminal growth, and reports an enterprise value result while triangulating with other methods. This shows a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF methodology consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast phase (sustained single‑digit/unit growth with reinvestment and margin dynamics) from a lower long‑term terminal growth (2.5%), and provides concrete growth and rationale (8% current growth, digital leverage, reinvestment) applied in the DCF. This shows a thorough, reasonable multi‑stage growth treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedents), provides specific numeric ranges, and explicitly triangulates them to derive an economically defensible bidding range and sensitivity-aware guidance. Depth and actionable conclusions meet the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual use of firm-level DCF and acknowledges reinvestment/capital intensity, implying an understanding that cash flows to the firm drive enterprise value. However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or state clearly that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes terminal value calculations both via a terminal-growth DCF (2.5% terminal growth) and by applying EBITDA multiples, satisfying the calculation requirement. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly treats enterprise value throughout (Implement/Validate) but contains no mention of subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value nor dividing by share count to derive price per share, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
