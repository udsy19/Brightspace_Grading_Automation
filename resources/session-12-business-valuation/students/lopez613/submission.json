  "transcript": "Hi I'm Damian\nLopez and this is my session\n12 assignment. The decision question\nthat I'm going to be solving today\nis what enterprise should KKR bid\nfor a Panera Bread in a competitive\nprocess against strategic buyers\nwhile preserving financial buyer\nreturn discipline? We are evaluating\na potential KKR take private\nof Panera Bread. The goal is not to\nfind the maximum price, but the\nhighest defensible price that still\nproduces private equity returns and a\ncompetitive auction. Panera is a scale\ndigitally mature asset with $6 billion\nof revenue, growing at 8% with $900\nmillion of earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization,\nand 50% digital mix. The challenge is\nthat strategic buyers can justify\npaying more by underwriting synergies,\nwhile KKR cannot. This valuation,\ntherefore, needs to distinguish value creation\nfrom value transfer. On to the next stage in the driver framework. We present how\nvalue Panera through three lenses. intrinsic value\nusing dcf market reality using trading\ncomps and control pricing using\nprecedent transactions throughout the\nprocess i'll toggle assumptions live\ngrowth margins capital intensity\ndiscount rate and exit multiples to show where\nvalue is robust versus fragile the goal is\nto find the overlap where all three methods\nagree on to the next stage in the driver\nframework implement. This base case, DCF,\nassumes sustained single-digit growth,\nunit growth, moderate margin expansion from\ndigital leverage and elevated reinvestment\nduring store rollout at a 9% weighted\naverage cost of capital and 2.5%\nterminal growth, Panera's intrinsic\nenterprise value is approximately\n$11.1 billion. Importantly, even under conservative assumptions, the valuation floor remains near $9 billion, while optimistic but\ndefensible assumptions push value into\nthe low routines. Trading comps anchor\nPanera between 12 and 15 times the\nEBITDA. Applying these multiples to $900 million\nof EBITDA produces an intrinsic enterprise\nvalue range of $10.8 billion dollars\nto 13.5 million dollars this aligns\nclosely with the dcf midpoint and confirms\nthat any outside bid out that any bid\noutside the band would either underpay relative\nto control value or overpay relative\nto engine intrinsic economics precedent\ntransactions confirm confirm that high\nquality restaurant options, restaurant\nplatforms transact between 12 to 15\ntimes the EBITDA. Panera fits\nsquarely within this cohort. This range\neffectively defines the market clearing\ncontrol corridor. Now to the next\nstage in the driver framework,\nvalidate. When we triangulate\nall three methods, the\noverlap zone, the region where\nintrinsic value, market pricing,\nand precedent deals agree, falls between\nroughly $11 and $12.6 billion of\nenterprise value. This is the\neconomically defensible bidding range for\na financial buyer. on to the next stage in the driver\nframework evolve kkr should open\nwith a credible but disciplined bid\naround 11.5 billion dollars signaling\nseriousness without surrendering returns\nthe optimal win zone is 11.7 to 12\n.6 billion dollars which is high enough\nto compete but low enough to preserve\ninternal rate of returns if the auction\npushes above 13.5 billion dollars KKR\nshould walk as that price reflects strategic\nsynergies rather than financial value\ncreation onto the next stage in the driver\nframework reflect Panera is an exceptional asset, but\ndiscipline matters. The correct financial\nbuyer valuation is not the highest price\npossible, but the highest price that\nstill generates returns through execution\nrather than optimism. KKIR should bid\nassertively within the 11.7 to 12.6\nbillion dollars range and walk\naway if the process becomes\nsynergy driven. That distinction\nbetween value creation and value\ntransfer is the core insight ofanalysis. Thank you."
