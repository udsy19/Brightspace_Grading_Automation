  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and implements a DCF forecasting free cash flows (including capex and NWC adjustments) and explicitly uses WACC (with sensitivity) to derive present enterprise value. Coverage is detailed and applied (model function, cash-flow build, WACC sensitivity), meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year explicit forecast from a terminal assumption and uses concrete, sensible rates (higher near-term growth tied to new stores and digital gains, lower long-term terminal growth). They also produced downside scenarios and sensitivity analysis showing the consequences, meeting the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses a DCF driven by unlevered cash flows (run_DCF) and applies an explicit WACC (base 9%) as the discounting assumption, plus sensitivity to 10–11%. Using an industry-average WACC and stress-testing it demonstrates a defensible and thorough application, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models key FCF elements (CapEx, working capital adjustments) and uses a DCF engine with tax assumptions, indicating understanding that unlevered cash flow funds debt/equity. However, the treatment omits explicit mention of depreciation add-back and an explicit NOPAT/EBIT step; discussion is accurate but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value approach (uses a terminal growth rate in the DCF and checks implied multiples), and they ran and validated these results with the run_DCF engine and sensitivity analysis. However, they do not explicitly state that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF — only imply its importance via sensitivity — so the treatment is correct but not fully explicit or comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports an enterprise value and discusses debt pay-down capacity but never explicitly subtracts net debt to derive equity value or divides by share count to compute a price per share. Awareness of leverage appears, but the required EV→Equity→Price-per-share bridge is missing, so the criterion is not met.",
