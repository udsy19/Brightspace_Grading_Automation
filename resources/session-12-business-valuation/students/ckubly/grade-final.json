  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected appropriate comparable peers and explicitly applied EBITDA multiples to derive bid/valuation ranges, supported by numeric examples and reconciliation to a DCF and precedent multiples. DRIVER stages Represent/Discover/Validate provide clear evidence of applying the comparable methodology and contextualizing outliers, satisfying a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation using DCF, trading comps, and precedent transactions, reported numeric outcomes (11.6B DCF vs ~10.8B precedents), discussed why high trading multiples are unreasonable for a financial buyer, and provided a supported bid range plus sensitivity commentary—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states a five-year projection and ties revenue/EBITDA trajectories to stated assumptions (8% revenue growth, margin targets, store expansion and digital mix increases), and includes sensitivity/validation discussion. Under the MODERATE standard, this conceptual and assumption-linked treatment meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses a DCF projection approach and explicitly cites a WACC (9%) and sensitivity to changes in that discount rate, showing conceptual use of discounting. However, they do not explicitly state DCF as the present value of future free cash flows nor provide detailed discounting mechanics or thorough exposition, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding that DCF/direct cash flows drive valuation and that cash flows are used to service capital providers (quotes about cash-flow stability and paying down debt). However, they do not explicitly identify core Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or show their treatment; therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a DCF framework and uses EBITDA multiples/precedent transactions (implying an exit-multiple approach), so a terminal-value method is present conceptually. However, they do not explicitly show a terminal value calculation nor acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
