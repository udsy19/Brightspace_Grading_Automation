  "transcript": "So the first thing I started with when\n0:02\nconducting the session 12 assignment was\n0:04\nuh prompt my chat box so he'll know that\n0:07\nI'm an accounting student conducting a\n0:08\ncomprehensive business valuation\n0:10\nanalysis. I told it to act as a finance\n0:12\nprofessional with a good understanding\n0:14\nof Python and to apply the kiss\n0:16\nprinciple to the code. I then inputed\n0:18\nthe assignment overview um all the\n0:21\nassignment details\n0:24\nand then the specific assignment\n0:25\nrequirements at the bottom. And then I\n0:27\nwanted to also know that I wanted it in\n0:28\na summary to where I could explain it\n0:30\nand teach it to a five-year-old.\n0:34\nSo using the driver framework, uh we\n0:36\nhave the D or the define and discover\n0:38\nstage. So our objective is to\n0:40\ndeterminate is to determine a defensible\n0:42\nbid range for Preera Bread to support a\n0:44\nKKR or financial buyer takeover while\n0:47\nassessing the risk of being outbid by\n0:49\nstrategic buyers Starbucks or\n0:51\nMcDonald's. So key inputs and\n0:53\nassumptions are the financials. So we\n0:55\nhave about $6 billion in revenue which\n0:58\nis about 8% growth. Uh 900 million in\n1:01\nEBITDA which is about 15% margin and net\n1:04\nincome of 400 million. We have a work\n1:07\nworking average cost of capital of 9%\n1:09\nwhich is the base. The multiples is we\n1:11\nhave an industry of about 22x and a\n1:15\npresident EBITDA of 12 to 15x. In the\n1:18\nKKR view is the financial buyers focus\n1:21\non cash flow stability, debt capacity\n1:23\nand operational efficiency or digital\n1:25\nmix.\n1:28\nIn the strategic view is competitors um\n1:30\nMcDonald's and Starbucks can pay a\n1:32\npremium due to synergies um which are\n1:35\nsupply chain consolidation and share\n1:37\ntech stacks.\n1:39\nNumber two is represent. So we're going\n1:41\nto build a Python valuation model model\n1:43\nthat triangulates value using three\n1:45\nmethods. So the uh DCF or the intrinsic\n1:48\nvalue um this is a five-year projection\n1:51\nbased on store growth and digital\n1:53\nexpansion trading comps or relative\n1:56\nvalue which is benchmarking against\n1:58\nChipotle and McDonald's. And the third\n2:01\nis precedent transactions which is\n2:03\nacquisition value and it's based on the\n2:05\nEBITDA multiples for similar deals. And\n2:08\nthis is the code um for the calculators\n2:11\nthat we just talked about.\n2:14\nNumber four is validate. So internal\n2:17\nconsistency or the base uh direct cash\n2:20\nflows are approximately about 11.6\n2:22\nbillion and it aligns well with the\n2:24\nlower end of the president transa\n2:26\ntransactions or about 12x and that is\n2:28\nequal to about 10.8 billion. The market\n2:31\nreality is the Chipotle multiple 35x to\n2:35\n14 billion is an outlier. KKR cannot pay\n2:38\n35x and achieve a standard 20% uh\n2:41\nwithout massive leverage or unrealistic\n2:44\ngrowth\n2:46\nand sensitivity check.\n2:48\nIf working average cost of capital rises\n2:50\nto 10% likely in a high rate environment\n2:52\nvalue drops significantly KKR must\n2:54\nremain disciplined. Number five is\n2:56\nevolve strategic uh synthesis. So for\n3:00\nthe financial buyer or the KKR logic uh\n3:03\ncan the constraint is the financial\n3:04\nbuyers rely on the targets cash flow to\n3:06\npay down debt and they cannot pay for\n3:09\nhoped for synergies and the bid zone is\n3:12\nabout 10.8 8 billion which is about a\n3:14\n12x multiple to a 12.5 billion uh base\n3:18\ndirect cash flows\n3:21\nand the strategic buyer with the\n3:23\nMcDonald's Starbucks logic is the\n3:25\nadvantage is they can eliminate Panera's\n3:27\nuh headquarter costs merge supply chains\n3:29\nand cross-ell the synergy value about so\n3:32\nour model estimates about 2.4 4 billion\n3:34\nin capitalized synergies and the bid\n3:37\nzone is about $14 billion.\n3:40\nSo so to reflect on our executive\n3:42\nrecommendation. So we recommend to\n3:45\ninvest committee KKR from finance team\n3:48\nand the subject is project Panera\n3:49\nvaluation and bid strategy. So number\n3:52\none valuation range and recommendation\n3:55\nwe recommend an opening bid of about 11\n3:57\nbillion or about 12.2x 2x uh EBITDA with\n4:01\na walk away price of about 12.5 billion\n4:04\nwhich is about a 13.9x multiple. Um this\n4:08\nrange is supported by our base uh base\n4:10\ncase DCF of about 11.6 billion and falls\n4:13\nwithin the standard president\n4:14\ntransaction range of about 12 to 15x.\n4:17\nThe only risk is current trading\n4:19\nmultiples uh for high growth peers as\n4:22\nabout Chipotle for example Chipotle has\n4:24\nabout 35x\n4:26\num and that imply expectations we cannot\n4:28\nmeet as a financial buyer\n4:31\nnumber two the strategic conflict so\n4:33\nstrategic buyers Starbucks McDonald's\n4:35\ncan just uh can't justify or they can\n4:39\njustify paying 14 billion by factoring\n4:41\noperational synergies of about 2.4 4\n4:44\nbillion. So a strategy for uh the\n4:46\nstrategic conflict is if a strate if a\n4:49\nstrategic buyer enters the auction do\n4:51\nnot engage in a bidding war we cannot\n4:53\ncompete on price without destroying our\n4:55\ninitial rate of return. Um\n4:58\nthe winning angle is so if we must\n5:00\ncompete pitch management rollover. So\n5:03\nPanera management may prefer KKR or\n5:05\nprivate equity to stay independent and\n5:08\neventually um initial public offer again\n5:11\nrather than being swallowed by\n5:12\nMcDonald's corporate uh bureaucracy.\n5:16\nAnd number three um execution levers to\n5:20\nto make the deal work at 11 to 12\n5:22\nbillion. We must aggressively expand the\n5:24\ndigital mix to 70% or do a margin\n5:27\nuplift, execute the 500 store expansion\n5:29\nplan efficiently or exit via um initial\n5:33\npublic offering in 5 years uh when\n5:35\nmarket conditions favor growth. And so\n5:38\nfor a summary um that I could give to a\n5:41\n5-year-old. So imagine Panera is a very\n5:43\npopular lemonade stand. the math. We\n5:45\nlooked at how much money the stand made\n5:47\nmakes today and they made about six\n5:49\nbillion and guessed uh how much it will\n5:51\nmake for the next five summers. The\n5:53\nprice tag we think the stand is worth\n5:55\nabout 11.5 billion. The problem there\n5:58\nare other rich kids in the neighborhood\n5:59\nlike McDonald's because they because\n6:02\nthey already own their other own other\n6:04\nstands. They can save money by sharing\n6:05\nlemons and cups. This means they can\n6:07\nafford to pay $14 billion for Panera.\n6:10\nThe plan is that we should offer 11\n6:12\nbillion dollars. If the rich kids could\n6:14\nshow up and offer, we offer way more. We\n6:17\nshould stop bidding because if we pay\n6:18\ntoo much, we won't have enough money\n6:20\nleft to buy our own ice cream later."
