  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly defines the DCF terminal formula using free cash flow and applies WACC as the discount rate, runs a five‑year FCF projection, and performs WACC sensitivity and terminal‑value checks. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the Gordon Growth terminal value formula, ran the DCF in code, and reported TV as ~69–79% across scenarios (76% in base), demonstrating both calculation and acknowledgement that TV drives the majority of value. This meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year explicit forecast and a Gordon-growth terminal, uses plausible higher near-term revenue scenarios (e.g., 8% base, upside/downside cases) and lower long-term terminal growth (2–3.5%), and ran sensitivity tests showing terminal-value dominance. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound multi-stage growth approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, active use of FCF in a firm-level DCF (EV/WACC/terminal value) and shows awareness of EBITDA/EBIT and reconciliation to cash, but does not explicitly list all FCF components (NOPAT, CapEx, ΔWorking Capital) or plainly state that FCF is cash available to all providers. This is a correct but incomplete conceptual treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission produces EV figures and final bid/equity targets and shows model implementation and validation effort, indicating conceptual understanding. However it does not explicitly show subtracting Net Debt (or Debt less Cash) from EV to derive Equity Value nor dividing by share count to get Price Per Share, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documents multiple sanity checks and cross-checks (Validate stage) and ran stress tests, showing awareness of validation. However, they do not cite specific external validation sources (e.g., named calculators, websites, or third‑party data checks), only internal comparisons and tools (Gemini/Colab), so this meets a partial but not full PASS under the category-specific standards.",
