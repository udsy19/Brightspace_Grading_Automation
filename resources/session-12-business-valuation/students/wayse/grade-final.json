  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present value of projected unlevered free cash flows, specifies the UFCF formula and terminal valuation methods, and implements discounting in a Python model. They also calculate and stress-test WACC and show its impact on PV/enterprise value, demonstrating a thorough introductory-level grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines the FCF components (EBIT*(1−tax), D&A addback, CapEx, ΔWC), implements those in a Python projection of unlevered free cash flow, and discounts those flows to enterprise value—demonstrating clear understanding that UFCF drives enterprise value (cash available to all capital providers). This is thorough and applied, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly implements terminal value calculations via Gordon growth and exit-multiple approaches, reports PVs showing terminal value dominates enterprise value, and includes a validation rule about TV representing a large share (70–80%). The inclusion across Represent, Implement, and Reflect stages demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound treatment, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the need to adjust EV for net debt and to calculate implied share price and ran a Python model that produced EV and a price output, demonstrating correct conceptual steps. However, the submission lacks a clear, detailed numeric bridge (no explicit net-debt subtraction shown or share count/division demonstrated and some reported numbers are inconsistent), so the treatment is correct but incomplete — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed clear sanity checks and external benchmarking against peers and precedent multiples and discussed limitations and fixes. However, they did not cite specific external sources/tools (e.g., named databases, websites, or calculators), so per the category standards this meets partial rather than full credit.",
