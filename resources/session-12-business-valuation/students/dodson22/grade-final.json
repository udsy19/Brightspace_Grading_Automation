  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as discounting FCFF using a WACC and applies it in practice (9% base) with sensitivity analysis showing impact of changing WACC. The use of the driver framework and scenario/sensitivity work demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC to discount FCFF and cites an industry-based 9% base rate, then demonstrates robustness by changing WAC to 10% and showing the EV effect. This shows a defensible choice and applied sensitivity testing, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares DCF and precedent/relative valuations, runs sensitivity scenarios to produce an intrinsic range and floor, and explicitly triangulates to recommend an 11.5B bid as a midpoint. These elements demonstrate a thorough, applied treatment of valuation triangulation and sensitivity consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses FCFF in a DCF (discounting FCFF at WACC to derive enterprise value), demonstrating basic conceptual understanding that free cash flow to the firm drives EV. However, they do not enumerate or explain FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or discuss why FCFF represents cash available to all providers in any depth, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates inclusion of a terminal-growth assumption (used in sensitivity analysis) and produces a DCF-based EV, so the Terminal Value is present in the model. However, they do not explicitly show the TV calculation details (growth vs. multiple, amounts) nor acknowledge that TV typically represents the majority of DCF value, so treatment is correct but limited.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly references terminal growth and parameterizes assumptions and runs sensitivity tests, showing conceptual awareness of terminal vs inputs. However, they do not articulate distinct forecast-period (explicit) growth rates or justify higher short-term vs lower long-term growth assumptions with values or rationale, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
