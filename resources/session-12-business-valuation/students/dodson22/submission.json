  "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,700\nGood evening, my\nname is Maya and this\n\n2\n00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,940\npresentation is going to\ndeliver a comprehensive\n\n3\n00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,760\nbusiness valuation\nof Panerabrid for\n\n4\n00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,480\na prospective KKR\ntakeover. My analysis\n\n5\n00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,520\nadheres to the driver\nframework and aims to\n\n6\n00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,460\nproduce a data-backed\nbid recommendation.\n\n7\n00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,780\nSo obviously I'm doing\n\n8\n00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,300\nthe section 6 assignment.\n\n9\n00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,680\nSo onto Google\nColab and Python.\n\n10\n00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,420\nSo obviously the first\nthing we begin with\n\n11\n00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,040\nis define and discover.\nSo all valuation\n\n12\n00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,560\nassumptions are centralized\nand parameterized\n\n13\n00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,600\nhere. We are valuing\nPanera, a $900 million\n\n14\n00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,660\nEBITDA target, using\nthe industry-based,\n\n15\n00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,560\nindustry-provided\nbase WAC of 9%. And\n\n16\n00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,540\ncritically, the market\nprecedent M&A multiples,\n\n17\n00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,420\nwhich guide transaction\npricing, range for\n\n18\n00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,460\nabout 12 times to 15\ntimes the EBITDA. And\n\n19\n00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,120\nthen we have about $6\nmillion in revenue.\n\n20\n00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,480\nSo on to the\nsecond and third\n\n21\n00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,200\nstages of drivers,\nso the R and I.\n\n22\n00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,000\nSo we can get into\n\n23\n00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560\nthis with our core\nmodel. So first the\n\n24\n00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,860\nDCF for the financial\nbuyers base case.\n\n25\n00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,190\nSo I'll go down to\nthe DCF output table,\n\n26\n00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,060\nwhich are down here\nand right here.\n\n27\n00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,600\nSo, the required\nand intermediate\n\n28\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200\ncalculations are visible.\n\n29\n00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,880\nThe free cash flows\nto firm or FCFF, which\n\n30\n00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,020\nare right here, is\ncalculated transparently\n\n31\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,700\nhere, which we\ndiscount at 9%. And the\n\n32\n00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,460\nresulting DCF case-based\nenterprise value is\n\n33\n00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:56,760\naround $9 billion. dollars\nand then we have our\n\n34\n00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,320\nrelative valuation\njust right here which\n\n35\n00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,740\nprovides necessary\ncontext to the precedent\n\n36\n00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,020\ntransactions using\nEBITDA analysis gives us\n\n37\n00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,400\na competitive market\nrange of about 10 million\n\n38\n00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,040\nto billion I'm sorry\nto 13.5 billion\n\n39\n00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,740\nwhich is a crucial\nbenchmark for M&A and then\n\n40\n00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,760\nwe go to stages four\nand five of the driver\n\n41\n00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,880\nframework. So we have\nvalidate and evolve.\n\n42\n00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,780\nWe validate the\nmodel's robustness\n\n43\n00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060\nthrough sensitivity\n\n44\n00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,980\nanalysis, which\nwe see right here.\n\n45\n00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,140\nThis\n\n46\n00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,420\nis using WAC and the\nterminal growth. So we\n\n47\n00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,460\nobserve that our most\nconservative scenario\n\n48\n00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,960\npushes the valuation\nto a floor of about\n\n49\n00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,920\n$8.4 billion,\nestablishing our empirical\n\n50\n00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,380\nwalkaway point or\nwalkaway price and then\n\n51\n00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,720\nfor evolve we evolve\nthe analysis by running\n\n52\n00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,340\nour three core scenarios\nconfirming that\n\n53\n00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,540\nour intrinsic financial\nrange is between\n\n54\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,340\neight point four\nbillion to ten point one\n\n55\n00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,400\nbillion dollars and so\nnow I'm going to shy\n\n56\n00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,260\nto show this live demo\nusing this so obviously\n\n57\n00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,940\nhere we can see that\nthe valuations are\n\n58\n00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,750\n9 billion, 9.75, 10,\nand this is with our\n\n59\n00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,780\n9% discount. Now\nif I change this,\n\n60\n00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,280\nour WAC base from 9\n% to 10%, and I run\n\n61\n00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,620\nthis and remember our\nvaluation numbers.\n\n62\n00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,000\nI run this and\nscroll back down.\n\n63\n00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,140\nNow it is less.\nNow it is 7.8\n\n64\n00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,840\nbillion, 8.4 billion.\nSo we go from\n\n65\n00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,740\nthe upper nine\nbillions to lower.\n\n66\n00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,860\nSo to demonstrate\nthe required\n\n67\n00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,280\ntechnical rigor, I\nadjusted the WAC from\n\n68\n00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,660\n9% to 10%. So the\nenterprise value\n\n69\n00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,650\ninstantly drops from\n9 billion to about 7\n\n70\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120\nbillion and then we\nhave our 8 billion\n\n71\n00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,220\nconfirming that this\nmodel has complete\n\n72\n00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,720\nparameterized flexibility\nand then we go on to our\n\n73\n00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,900\nfinal recommendation\nand kind of last\n\n74\n00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,840\nstage of the driver\nframework just fresh now\n\n75\n00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,240\nso to finalize the\ncompetitive picture we\n\n76\n00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120\ncan kind of quantify\nthe perspective of\n\n77\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,520\nstrategic bidders. So\nby adding potential\n\n78\n00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,380\noperating synergies, so\nsorry, the model shows\n\n79\n00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,820\nthat a strategic buyer\ncan realize a present\n\n80\n00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,360\nvalue of synergies\nof about $1 billion.\n\n81\n00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,940\nAnd this is seen,\nwe can see here\n\n82\n00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,490\nwith the field\ntriangulation data\n\n83\n00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,120\ntable, which is\nobviously what I just\n\n84\n00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000\nshowed that synthesizes\nthe results.\n\n85\n00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,860\nSo we enter the\nreflect stage where\n\n86\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,640\nwe can kind of\ntriangulate all\n\n87\n00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,740\nresults to determine\nthe final bid.\n\n88\n00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,100\nSo our walkaway price,\nwhich I'll go back\n\n89\n00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,800\nand change the black\nback to 10% or back\n\n90\n00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,580\nto 9%. So it will be\n10% and go back down.\n\n91\n00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,620\nSo our walkaway price\nusing these models\n\n92\n00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,340\nis going to be about\n$9 billion with our EV.\n\n93\n00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,740\nand this is based on\nour downside analysis\n\n94\n00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,940\nand meeting KKR's IRR\nhurdle and then our\n\n95\n00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,140\nrecommended winning\nbid is going to be\n\n96\n00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,540\nthe $11.5 billion EV\nwhich is kind of a\n\n97\n00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,970\nstrategic midpoint between\nthe DCF and precedence\n\n98\n00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,500\nand then to kind of\nrationale this bid\n\n99\n00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,280\nI would say it's\ncompetitive because it is\n\n100\n00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,240\nstrategically positioned\nabove our financial\n\n101\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,240\nDCF value, which we\nsee valuations down\n\n102\n00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,920\nhere, but it is below\nthe full synergy\n\n103\n00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,380\nvalue, which we see up\nhere in these areas.\n\n104\n00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,160\nAnd we can justify\nthe premium through\n\n105\n00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,040\nactionable operational\nimprovements like the\n\n106\n00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,520\nmanagement rollover and\nmargin expansion plan\n\n107\n00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,480\nallowing KKR to\ncompete aggressively\n\n108\n00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,160\nagainst strategic\nbuyers while maintaining\n\n109\n00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,480\nfinancial discipline.\nSo that is all the steps\n\n110\n00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,970\nabout this case through\nthe driver framework\n\n111\n00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,300\nand that is all I\nhave for you today."
