  "transcript": "0:01\nOkay. Hello, my name is Levi Shrant\n0:06\nand this\n0:08\nis assignment 12 for management 310. And\n0:12\ntoday we are uh given the hypothetical\n0:16\nsituation to decide whether or not we\n0:18\nwant to\n0:20\num take over\n0:23\nPanera Bread using the driver method.\n0:28\nSo, we're going to combine DCF, trading\n0:30\ncomps, uh, precedent transactions to\n0:33\nproduce an informed bid range, uh, for\n0:37\nus for, uh, to whether or not we want to\n0:40\npurchase, uh, Panera.\n0:43\nUm,\n0:45\nand then below here is just a snapshot\n0:49\nof the deal.\n0:51\nSo we the goal of this is just to create\n0:53\nan executive uh ready rec uh\n0:56\nrecommendation.\n0:59\nSo from this information\n1:02\nuh and with the help of uh Gemini\n1:05\nmade um this code\n1:10\nuh right here. Um so using the driver\n1:15\nframework uh I analyzed the target from\n1:18\nthe perspective of a a disciplined uh\n1:22\nfinancial buyer and I think my analysis\n1:28\nuncovered a a massive disconnect between\n1:32\nuh the market hype and also just like\n1:34\nthe financial reality of of Panera.\n1:39\nSo while the the market currently prices\n1:43\nPanera between 12 and 13 billion, the\n1:46\ncompany's intrinsic cash flows only\n1:48\nsupport a valuation of roughly uh 7 12\n1:51\nbillion. So So how did we how did we\n1:56\nfind that?\n1:58\nSo uh in the define and discover\n2:03\nuh phase\n2:05\nwe uh mapped the landscape for this and\n2:08\nwe saw that Panera is uh undeniably just\n2:11\na strong asset and they generate about 6\n2:14\nbillion in revenue and maintain healthy\n2:16\n15% margins. However, they are operating\n2:19\nin an overheated market with peers like\n2:21\nChipotle trading at 35 times earnings\n2:25\nand sellers are expecting, you know, a\n2:27\nmassive premium for the future growth of\n2:29\nthe company. But at the end of the day,\n2:32\nwe are uh KKR\n2:35\nuh also aka financial buyer and unlike a\n2:42\nstrategic buyer like Starbucks, we don't\n2:44\nhave immediate cost synergies to fall\n2:46\nback on. So we need to generate a 20%\n2:49\ninternal rate of return purely through\n2:51\noperational efficiency and leverage. Uh\n2:55\nso this constraint defines\n2:58\nexcuse me our entire approach.\n3:04\nSo to solve this I moved to the\n3:05\nimplementation phase and I built an\n3:08\nautomated Python valuation engine to\n3:10\nstrip away the market sentiment and\n3:12\nfocus strictly on the cash flows.\n3:16\nSo if you look at the base case on\n3:18\nscreen\n3:20\num\n3:25\nover here you can see that\n3:29\nthe\n3:31\num\n3:32\nintrinsic enterprise value is only 7.5\n3:35\nbillion. Um\n3:38\nso this is the anchor for our analysis\n3:41\nand the fundamentals simply do not\n3:43\nsupport uh the current asking price\n3:46\nwhich I will get into in our Python\n3:48\nscript output here in a minute.\n3:52\nSo to validate our finding with the uh\n3:56\nwith our output\n3:59\ndown here\n4:02\num\n4:04\nwe we validated it by triangulating it\n4:08\nagainst the market. So\n4:14\nto do that and\n4:19\num hold on, let me try to switch the\n4:22\nscreen so you can see the graphic.\n4:43\nOkay. Well, I can't figure it out. So,\n4:46\nI'll just like explain the visual.\n4:49\nUm,\n4:51\nso the visual represents the valuation\n4:54\ngap. So there's blue bars that show what\n4:57\nthe market thinks Panera is worth\n5:00\nuh based on trading multiples and past\n5:02\ndeals which is roughly like we mentioned\n5:04\nat the beginning uh about 11 to 13\n5:07\nbillion. Um and the red line is the\n5:10\nintrinsic value of the company which is\n5:13\nabout uh 7.5 billion.\n5:17\nUm,\n5:20\nso this gap is critical because if KKR\n5:23\npays the market price of 12 billion, we\n5:26\nare effectively paying for growth that\n5:27\nhasn't happened yet. So that eliminates\n5:30\nour safety margin and destroys our\n5:32\npotential returns.\n5:34\nSo why is the market price so high? In\n5:38\nthe evolve phase of\n5:42\nthis this framework, we looked at the\n5:45\nbuyer landscape. So a strategic buyer\n5:48\nlike Starbucks or McDonald's can justify\n5:51\npaying 13 or 14 billion. This is because\n5:54\nthey can immediately rip out abundant\n5:56\ncosts,\n5:59\nredundant costs, sorry, like supply\n6:01\nchain and headquarter expenses. But\n6:03\nagain, we are KKR and we cannot pay for\n6:05\nthe synergies that we do not have. So if\n6:08\nwe try to compete with Starbucks in a\n6:09\nbidding war, we'll win the auction but\n6:11\nlose money on the exit ultimately.\n6:15\nSo\n6:17\nthis brings me to my final\n6:18\nrecommendation,\n6:20\nwhich is based on the data, KKR should\n6:22\nnot chase this deal at the market price.\n6:26\nSo our winning bid strategy is to submit\n6:28\na disciplined offer in the 8.5 to 9.5\n6:31\nbillion range.\n6:33\nAnd this is aggressive relative to our\n6:36\nbase case which values it at 7 12\n6:38\nbillion. But it's defensible because if\n6:41\nwe believe we can execute the turnaround\n6:44\num then um then the 8.5 to9 12 billion\n6:49\nis worth it. So if the seller demands\n6:52\nthe $13 billion um then we suggest we\n6:56\nshould let a strategic buyer overpay for\n6:59\nthat asset since our discipline is our\n7:02\ncompetitive advantage in this situation.\n7:05\nSo yeah that is all. Thank you."
