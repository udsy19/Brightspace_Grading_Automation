  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines free cash flow to the firm and presents the WACC formula/assumption, implements a DCF model with numeric WACC (9%) and PV/terminal calculations, and performs sensitivity/validation—showing a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the correct FCF-to-firm formula (NOPAT + D&A - ΔNWC - CapEx), explains that FCF is available to debt and equity holders, implements the formula in code, and reports concrete FCF projections used in valuation. This is a thorough, applied treatment satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated and reported a terminal value and its present value, quantified its ~80% contribution to enterprise value, and justified why that level is acceptable for a mature business. They also validated and sensitivity-tested the TV within the DRIVER implementation and validation stages, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes and discusses enterprise values and a recommended acquisition price but never shows subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to convert EV to equity value, nor dividing equity value by share count to produce a price per share. Given the absence of the explicit EV-to-equity bridge and per‑share calculation, the criterion is not met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student conducts sanity checks by triangulating the DCF with precedent-transaction (PPA) and comparable-company results and runs sensitivity tests, showing conceptual external validation. However, they do not cite specific external data sources, calculators, or tools used to obtain the PPA/comps figures, so the validation is general rather than explicitly sourced.",
