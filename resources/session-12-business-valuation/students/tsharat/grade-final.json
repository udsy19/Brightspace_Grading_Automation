  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly constructs a cash‑flow based DCF (five‑year projections with Free Cash Flow referenced), applies WACC (explicit 9.0%) to derive Enterprise Value, and performs sensitivity/terminal value checks. Multiple scenarios, sensitivity analysis, and use of FCF demonstrate a thorough introductory treatment consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated Terminal Value (growth-based Tg = 3.0%) and referenced a multiples check (EV/EBITDA 12.5x), and quantified that TV makes up 78.3% of EV. They also performed sensitivity/testing of WACC and Tg, showing thorough understanding and prudent validation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast from the terminal period, specifies a terminal growth rate (3.0%) and short-term growth drivers (new stores, digital sales), and quantifies sensitivity and terminal-value concentration. The combination of Implement and Validate work demonstrates a thorough, reasonable multi-stage growth approach consistent with the DRIVER framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses Free Cash Flow conceptually (allocating FCF to debt service in the LBO analysis and employing a DCF to value enterprise cash flows), demonstrating correct basic understanding that FCF drives valuation and services capital. However, they do not explicitly identify the standard FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, Depreciation, CapEx, Working Capital) nor explicitly state FCF as cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission reports multiple Enterprise Value figures and even lists a debt amount, but nowhere shows subtracting Net Debt (Debt less Cash) from EV to derive Equity Value or dividing resulting Equity Value by share count to get Price Per Share. The evidence shows EV-centric outputs and an ambiguous P/E/EV statement, indicating the EV→Equity→Per-share bridge was missing or not demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission shows internal validation (sensitivity analysis, terminal-value check) and comparison to precedent multiples, demonstrating awareness of sanity checks (Validate stage). However, it does not name specific external sources or tools (e.g., PitchBook, Capital IQ, public filings, or named calculators) used to corroborate the precedent/comps data, so it meets the MODERATE rubric only partially.",
