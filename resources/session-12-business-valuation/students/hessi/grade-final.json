  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as the intrinsic (present) value of future cash flows and explicitly uses WACC (9% base with sensitivity) to discount and derive enterprise value ranges, with numeric results and sensitivity analysis. Treatment is applied and detailed enough (assumptions, scenarios, PV outcomes), meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory-level demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly uses a terminal value via the Gordon growth approach (specified terminal growth rates) and provides quantitative sensitivity results showing small changes in the terminal rate materially shift EV, demonstrating that the terminal value drives the bulk of valuation. These points, supported by the Implement and Reflect stages, meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast period from the terminal period and uses reasonable converging assumptions (higher short-term revenue 8% → 5% then lower long-term terminal 2.5–3.5%, base 3%). They support choices with sensitivity analysis and reflective commentary demonstrating conceptual understanding and defensible assumptions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of a DCF to value the firm and discounts projected cash flows with WACC, indicating an understanding that DCF/EV reflects firm cash generation. However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor clearly state that FCF equals cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student repeatedly reports enterprise values and anchors bid ranges but never shows subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive Equity Value, nor dividing by share count to produce a Price Per Share. IMPLEMENT and VALIDATE evidence show EV-focused analysis without the required EV-to-equity bridge, so the criterion is not met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed appropriate sanity checks using comps, precedents, triangulation and sensitivity analysis (VALIDATE, REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT) but did not cite any specific external sources, tools, or datasets for cross-checking. Per the category standards, this meets partial credit.",
