  "transcript": "Hello everyone, this is Chris and I am\npresenting my valuation of Panera bread\nfor a pro p prospective KKR takeover. So\nusing the driver framework uh define,\nrepresent, implement, validate, evolve\nand reflect, I have built a dynamic\nmodel to determine a winning bid\nstrategy that balances financial\ndiscipline against strategic\ncompetition.\nSo, uh, starting with stage one, our\ndefine and discover stage, um, we're\nlooking at a strong asset asset. We have\n$6 billion in revenue, uh, 900 billion\nin EBITDA\nwith a 15% margin and a digital mix,\nexcuse me, of 50%. Which is best in\nclass. However, we face a challenge.\nWhile we are a financial buyer requiring\na strict return on investment, strategic\ncompetitors like McDonald's are\ncircling. Uh so I have put these\nassumptions here into Python\nuh and set our WACCC at 9%. So that's\nwhat this code does just uploads all\nthat and all the assumptions were\nloaded.\nNow moving to represent uh to find the\ntrue value I used a triangulation\napproach. Um so uh a um\nuh we're using a fiveyear discounted\ncash flow uh to calculate the intrinsic\nvalue of future cash flows. B uh we're\nusing trading comparables uh so\nbenchmarking against peers like\nChipotle.\nAnd C, we're doing precedent\ntransactions. So we're going to analyze\nwhat private equity firms might um have\nactually paid for similar assets in the\npast.\nAnd uh so this is going to help us rely\nuh help us ensure that we're not relying\non a single data point. And uh this is\njust me uploading that logic logic into\nthe Python code.\nSo moving on to the implement stage. Um\nand here we're just we're just going to\nexecute the model. So I already ran the\ncode here\nand uh our projections show revenue\ngrowing to 8.8. 8 billion uh by year\nfive.\nUm\nbased on this the intrinsic value of the\nbusiness is approximately 14.2\nbillion\nand uh however the market floor based on\npast deals is lower between 10.8 and\n13.5 billion.\nThis tells us immediately that paying\nthe full address value leaves us with\nvery little room for profit.\nSo, it's a big deal. Moving on to stage\nfour, the validate stage.\nUm, we're just going to stress test our\nassumptions. So, I did a sensitivity\nanalysis, uh, scenario testing and a vis\nvisual validation.\nUm, so,\noops, sorry.\nSo, uh, yeah, this heat map shows our\nvalue sensitivity to WACC and growth.\nUm and uh even if interest rates rise\nand our cost of capital hits 10% the\nvaluation holds above 10 billion. So\nthis is can confirm that we have a solid\ndownside floor. And I also ran a\ndownside scenario\nuh where growth slows to 4% and the\nvalue holds roughly roughly uh at 11\nbillion. So confirming\nuh the asset safety.\nOkay, moving on to stage five.\nUh so now we're going to evolve the view\nto look at the competitive landscape. So\nI wanted to use something called the\nfootball field chart and it's key to our\nstrategy.\nSo uh our base case value is here at\n14.2 billion. Um if everything goes\nperfectly, digital expansion,\ninternational growth, um the value could\ntheoretically reach 19 billion.\nExcuse me. Um\nthis is where the buyer uh like\nStarbucks\nuh lives. they can pay for that upside\ntoday because they realize the immediate\nsynergies\nand uh as KKR we cannot pay for the\nsynergies we don't have we must bid\nbelow the strategic ceiling but above\nthe precedent floor\nand yeah so finally to stage six uh\nlet's reflect and make a recommendation\num so my analysis my verdict uh is to\nbuy Um I recommend a bid range of 12.5\nto 13.5 billion. Um and this is going to\nimply roughly 14.5 times EB ITDA\nmultiple.\nUm and uh yeah we must we we also have\nto walk away if the price exceeds 14.5\nbillion. At that price we're paying for\nuh perfection.\nUh so yeah, the winning strategy since\nwe can't outbid a strategic buyer on\nprice alone, we win on terms of speed.\nWe offer deal certainty with no\nantitrust delays. And number two,\nmanagement alignment. We offer the\nmanagement team a 10% rollover equity\nstake. This allows them to participate\nuh in that future $19 billion upside\nuh when we exit in five years. So this\nis probably an incentive a strategic\nbuyer wouldn't offer.\nAnd yeah, um I hope you liked my\nanalysis and my conclusion and thank youfor watching."
