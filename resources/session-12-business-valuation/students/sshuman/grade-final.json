  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes calculating free cash flow (EBITDA less taxes, capex, NWC), discounting those flows and adding a terminal value, and explicitly cites a WACC (9%) and sensitivity to WACC and terminal growth. These elements show a solid, applied introductory DCF understanding across Discover/Implement/Reflect stages, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and specifies multiples (industry P ~22x, precedent 12–15x) and explicitly describes applying those peer multiples to Panera's earnings via the model. Combined with implementation and reflection statements, this shows a thorough, conceptually grounded comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly runs both a discounted cash flow (base/upside/downside) and trading/transaction multiples, performs sensitivity analysis on WACC and terminal growth, and provides a justified valuation range and bidding rationale anchored to precedent and trading multiples. These elements demonstrate a thorough triangulation and sensitivity treatment consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key FCF elements (EBIT/EBITDA, taxes, CapEx, and working/“networking” capital) and applies them in the implementation, and uses WACC to discount cash flows. However, they do not explicitly mention depreciation/NOPAT adjustments nor clearly state that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital; treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value in the DCF and uses a multiples-based exit approach (evidence: quotes 1 and 3) and shows DRIVER-aligned implementation and reflection. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF's value; they only note terminal growth sensitivity, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates the required elements: an explicit forecast period (five-year projections/scenarios) and addition of a terminal value, plus sensitivity testing of terminal growth. However, the growth-rate reasoning is cursory—only a short-term 8% revenue input and general remarks about maturity are given, without a clear, justified multi-stage transition explaining why short-term growth exceeds long-term terminal growth.
