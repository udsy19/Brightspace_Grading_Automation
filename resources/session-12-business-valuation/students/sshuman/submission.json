  "transcript": "Hello, this is a valuation analysis of\nPanera Bread for potential KKR takeover.\nUm, we are obviously going to be using\nthe driver framework to move from\ndiscovery to our final recommendation.\nFirst, let's go through the assignment\noverview. We have here as we go through\nit, we see our scale, the most important\nparts I'll go through. We have our scale\nof 6 billion in revenue with uh growing\n8%. We have 900 um we have over 900\nmillion in uh EBITDA.\nWe have our where is it at down here?\nOur 9% um WACC which reflects the cost\nof capital for a potential financial\nbuyer like KKR.\nAnd we also have our input ranges at\nindustry p at 22x and\num precedent transactions at uh 12 to 15\nx. The code block establishes a boundary\nconditions for the entire model.\nSo um\nhere we going through a little bit.\nLet's go through now the actual\nuh how I got to discover or how I\ndecided to do the code. Going through\nhere, you can see it's actually pretty\nlong um\nwith all of the uh parts that are needed\nfin for financial and technical steps.\nIt's pretty long. We have some steps\nhere and phases that we went through\num\nto implement\nour said Python engine. So,\nwe just scroll through a little bit here\nand we can see some phases that'll get\nthrough in a little bit. But\nafter that, let's get to the Python\ncode, which you'll have up here. Let's\nrun it to make sure it's working.\nAnd\ninstead of the statistical spreadsheet,\nwe'll use Python to automate the three\nscenarios, our base, our upside, and our\ndownside. And then it'll calculate free\nflow cash by taking the EB or the EBIT\nDA and stripping out taxes cap EX and\nnetworking capital\nand um it it'll then discount these\nflows and add a terminal value. Why this\nmatters I will say it gives us intrinsic\nvalue of Panera Bread on its actual cash\ngeneration not just the market hype.\nOkay, so the intrinsic value is only\nhalf the story. So we'll need a reality\ncheck. The function calculates trade\ncomp\nand uh precedent transactions. It\napplies peer multi multiples to Panera's\nearnings to see what the market thinks\nthe company is worth. Crucially, it\ncalculates a total to 15% uh EBITA or\nEBIT TBA DA range. See in historical\ndeals. This ensures KKR doesn't bid in a\nvacuum. We are anchoring our prices to\nthis uh real world exit multiple before\nwe before we bid we must validate. The\nsensitivity block stresses that the\nmodel\num stresses the model against the\nchanges in WACC\nand the terminal growth. The answers uh\nthe critical question, what happens if\ninterest rates rise or growth stalls?\nBut as we go through more of this, we'll\nsee how to use every single method. We\nhave our terminal value, all these\nvalues that are being calculated. And\nthen we have also our\nfinal values where we see all of these\nnumbers being calculated.\nWe have our base. We have our downside\nupside\nand we have our sensitivity analysis\nwith WACC and thermal growth. Here we\ncan see all these percentages.\nSo\nthis is a all to be done via Python\nto get these numbers. And going back to\nthe actual information here, we'll see\nwe have a football valuation summary\nhere.\nThis will help us reflect um the better\nlandscape. Strategical buyers like\nMcDonald strategical buyers like\nMcDonald's can\npay more because they can integrate\nsupply chains and tech stacks. KKR must\nrely on operational efficiencies and\ndebt payown. So, finally getting to it.\nSo we have here a lot of information to\ngo through. We have synergies valuation\ncamp growth plan test or risk tolerance\nwith somebody like KKR and then\nMcDonald's. Here we can see difference\nbetween the two.\nSo the recommendation\nthat we have reached is to receive with\na bid of 11.5 billion maybe 11.5 to 12.5\nbillion. The rationale we have is that\nwe are within the president transaction\nrange but below the lofty trade um\nmultiples of Chipotle. This ensures\nmargins of safety. We do not exceed the\n13.5 billion mark\nand the IR drives below required\nthresholds assuming or unless we assume\nunrealistic exit multiples position\nwe position the bid as speed and\ncertainty\nstrategical buyer space antirust\nscrutiny and integration delays. KKR\noffers a clean exit for current owners\nwith their 10% uh rollover to\nparticipate in future upside.\nSo going through a lot of this we see um\na hard walkway point of or price at 13.5\nbillion and if we let the price go uh\nhigher we'll let uh strategics have it.\nWe will not chase Chipotle multiples for\na mature asset.\nSo for the most part, this is most of\nthe uh\nmost of the information we have. I'll go\nthrough the Python a little more in\ndepth. So we can see all these numbers\nwith the downside the base and that's\nhow we get our numbers. So we can see\nenterprise values. You see all these\npercentages and\nand amounts compared with our five-year\nprojection\nfor each and then\nobviously our terminal growth which is\nvery important\nand our recommendations that we have\nvaluation financial strategic disconnect\nbid strategy and the next steps which\nare all incredibly important. Um\nand using all this information obviously\nyou reach the information the conclusion\nwe've already reached\nbut these are also important parts to\nlook at to understand what from some\nother ideas how some things might work\nbut for the most part this is where we\nwant to stay.Thank you."
