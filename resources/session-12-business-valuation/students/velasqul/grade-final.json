  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF as valuing future free cash flows (mentions unlevered FCF, terminal value, multi-scenario intrinsic valuation) and explicitly applies a WACC of 9% to discount cash flows. They also implemented the model in code and used multiple terminal methods/scenarios, showing thorough introductory-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five-year forecast period from a terminal period (Gordon growth and exit multiple) and provides concrete short-term growth scenarios (8% base, 10% upside, 4% downside) alongside a lower long-term terminal growth (2.5%). They link the short-term assumptions to business drivers (store expansion, digital sales) and produce scenario-based valuation outputs, demonstrating a thorough, reasonable multi-stage growth approach.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, Starbucks) and discussed trading comps/precedents, then applied an EBITDA multiple (13.5x) and converted it into a specific bid (13.3x, $12B). This demonstrates a thorough, practical application of introductory comparable methodology consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied awareness of unlevered free cash flow and uses it in a DCF to derive enterprise value (implying FCF to all capital providers), but they do not explicitly identify the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or discuss them in depth. This yields a correct but incomplete treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations (Gordon growth and exit multiple) and implements them in a coded DCF, demonstrating correct application. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF's value or show a numeric split, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise values and proposes equity bids but never discusses subtracting net debt (debt less cash) to derive equity value or dividing equity value by share count to produce a per-share price. Because the specific EV-to-equity bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
