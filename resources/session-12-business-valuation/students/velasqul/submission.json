  "transcript": "Hello everyone. Today we're on uh\n0:03\nsection 12. Uh I'm a bit sick today, so\n0:06\npardon my uh my voice, my stuffy nose,\n0:09\nand if I I cough a bit, uh the\n0:12\nassignment's tonight, so it needs to get\n0:13\ndone. Um we're going to be doing a\n0:17\nevaluation of Panera Bread for a\n0:20\nprospective uh KKR takeover using the\n0:23\ndriver method. Um we're going to be\n0:26\ncombining DCF trading comps and pre uh\n0:29\nprecedent transactions to produce an\n0:32\ninformal bid range and uh thinking about\n0:35\nfinancial buyer discipline with\n0:37\nstrategic buyer synergies. So Panera in\n0:41\nthis example uh they have six billion of\n0:44\nrevenue growing at 8% a year. $900\n0:47\nmillion of EVIDA with a 50% margin. 400\n0:51\nmillion net income across 2,100 stores.\n0:54\nDigital sales already uh 50%.\n0:58\nUm and some other market references the\n1:01\nindustry's uh price to earnings ratio is\n1:03\nnormally around 20 times.\n1:06\nPresident Eida\n1:08\nuh are around 12 to 15 times. Chipotle\n1:10\ntrades at 35. McDonald's at 25.\n1:14\nUm for our capital assumptions uh the\n1:17\nindustry's whack is 9% management wants\n1:20\n10% rollover. There are other strategic\n1:24\nbiders also looking to acquire Panera.\n1:26\nStarbucks uh and McDonald's are\n1:28\ncircling.\n1:30\nUm for the growth lovers uh Panera is\n1:33\ntrying to create 500 new stores in 5\n1:35\nyears, increase their digital revenue\n1:38\nand uh have catering expansion and some\n1:42\ninternational stores as well. So\n1:45\nobviously this is a very positive story\n1:47\nfor Panera. Um currently I know they've\n1:50\nbeen going through a pretty turbulent\n1:51\ntime. Uh their menu items have gotten uh\n1:55\nfairly expensive and provide uh poor\n1:57\nvalue. David, I know I've heard um due\n2:00\nto some of the management turnover of\n2:02\nPanera that they've been struggling a\n2:04\nbit recently, but this is the\n2:05\ninformation that we will be going off\n2:07\nfor this example because currently\n2:10\nthey're kind of uh in the bin right now.\n2:12\nThey're not doing too well. Uh so, first\n2:16\nwe're the first step we're going to do\n2:17\nis discover. Uh we're going to create an\n2:20\nexecutive ready recommendation that\n2:22\nstates our valuation range, our winning\n2:25\nbid strategy, and our rationale.\n2:28\nAnd so for the asset of Panera, it is a\n2:32\nhigh growth uh cash generative\n2:35\nuh fast casual business uh restaurant\n2:38\nwith significant digital penetration.\n2:41\nUh we went over the six billion revenue\n2:44\nand the 400 million of net income.\n2:48\nUh they got their growth story with\n2:51\ntheir stores and uh\n2:54\ninfrastructure.\n2:57\nUh\n2:59\nthe growth story relies on the unit\n3:01\nexpansion, the digital mix and the\n3:03\noperational leverage of uh getting more\n3:07\ndigital sales. And in the market around\n3:10\nPanera, you have high growth peers like\n3:12\nChipotle that trade at significant\n3:15\npremiums and uh other restaurants like\n3:18\nMcDonald's are trading around 25 times\n3:21\nprice to earnings which are you know\n3:23\npretty decent ranges not uh pretty\n3:26\nexpensive I would say for for food. Um\n3:32\nso for our buyer which is KKR we're\n3:35\nfocused on a leverage buyout math uh\n3:37\ndebt capacity and a 5-year exit. um\n3:40\nwe're constrained by the 9% uh weighted\n3:42\naverage cost of capital and need for a\n3:45\n20% uh internal rate of return\n3:50\nand uh Starbucks and McDonald's are\n3:52\ncircling the asset so they can uh pay\n3:55\nand they have some advantages like\n3:57\npaying for synergies they already have\n4:00\nexperience with supply chain and\n4:01\noverhead cons consolidation\n4:04\num it pretty uh be pretty easy for them\n4:06\nto integrate some of their operations\n4:08\nand uh a cost but we cannot uh do that.\n4:13\nSo now that we're on the represent step\n4:17\nwe're going to try to uh get valuation\n4:22\nevaluation of Fera and we'll be using uh\n4:25\ndiscounted cash flow to create a\n4:28\nfive-year multi- scenario model with\n4:30\nbase upside and downside to get the\n4:33\nintrinsic value of Panera's revenue\n4:36\ngrowth. Um we'll compare it to you know\n4:40\nthe peers McDonald's Starbucks\n4:42\nand uh\n4:46\nwe'll look at presidents in the\n4:48\ntransactions see what uh what has\n4:50\nhappened in the past to inform us what\n4:55\nuh pair would likely accept in terms of\n4:57\nan offer to buy the company. Um so for\n5:00\nour bottle inputs uh these are going to\n5:02\nbe pretty important because we'll be\n5:03\ndetermining uh how we value Panera.\n5:07\nUh we'll have a weighted average cost of\n5:09\ncapital of 9%.\n5:12\nU because of Panera's stable cash flows\n5:16\nand uh consumer discretionary risk.\n5:21\nuh we'll have a terminal value using the\n5:23\nGordon growth model of 2.5%\n5:27\nand an exit multiple method of 13 and a\n5:29\nhalf times EIDA. Um so for our scenarios\n5:34\nwe have a a base scenario where there's\n5:37\n8% growth 15% margin an upside where\n5:40\nthere's 10% growth 68 and 12% margin and\n5:44\na downside with 4% growth and 13 and a\n5:47\nhalf% margin. Um obviously we don't want\n5:50\nthat to happen but it's a possibility so\n5:52\nwe have to try to prepare for it.\n5:55\nUm so now I made it uh I made a DCF in a\n6:01\nPython code. So as you can see here we\n6:05\ninstalled libraries uh imported the\n6:09\ndifferent uh financial\n6:11\nfinancial tools and we have our\n6:13\nassumptions and inputs over here that we\n6:16\ntalked about earlier. We have our DCF\n6:18\nassumptions, the financials,\n6:20\nuh, and then now we have, uh, the market\n6:24\nmultiples of the other companies,\n6:26\nand here are scenarios right here. So\n6:29\nnow we're going to run it. And we have\n6:31\nour three variables of growth, margin,\n6:33\nexit multiple.\n6:36\nAnd as we go down, he'll do the\n6:38\ncalculations for unlevered free cash\n6:39\nflow, terminal value, discount cash\n6:42\nflows\n6:45\nand uh return the average of both\n6:47\nmethods.\n6:50\nThen we'll be calculating the ranges\n6:53\nfor a football field type of analysis\n6:55\nusing precedent transactions and trading\n6:58\ncomps.\n7:00\nAnd as we look down here, we'll have our\n7:02\nuh the summary of the outputs of our\n7:05\nmodel. Um\n7:08\nthe\n7:10\nDCF base case\n7:13\num enterprise value is 9.705\n7:19\nbillion.\n7:20\nUm looking at precedence of prior\n7:23\ntransactions in the 12 to 15 times I\n7:26\neven range, it's around 10.8 8 billion\n7:29\nto 13.5 billion and the other trading\n7:32\ncomps around 10 to 15 billion. So you\n7:36\ncan kind of see this uh\n7:39\nsee this here you have the DCF the DCF\n7:42\nrange here\n7:45\nfrom our lower to our higher\n7:48\nuh scenarios\n7:50\nand then you have uh the precedent\n7:52\ntransactions of 10 to 13.5 billion and\n7:55\nuh some other trading comps. So ideally\n7:57\nwe want to get somewhere if we're going\n7:59\nto put offer for Panera uh we assume we\n8:03\nwould put an offer somewhere in the in\n8:05\nthe range that uh matches up here.\n8:08\nUm\n8:13\nso as we validate um\n8:17\nthe low end of the uh president\n8:19\ntransactions was 10.5\n8:22\n10.8 eight billion dollars\n8:25\nof uh of value. Uh the ceiling was 15\n8:30\nbillion of enterprise value of a perfect\n8:33\nexecution and the fair value is around\n8:34\n12.5 to 13.5 billion.\n8:37\nUm so if we look at this of the\n8:40\nfinancial of KKR versus McDonald's,\n8:45\nKKR\n8:47\nis constrained by their cash flow and\n8:50\nleverage. U they'd have to take out a\n8:52\nlot of debt to acquire Panera. Um while\n8:57\nuh McDonald's\n9:00\nlike could kind of sell that they could\n9:02\ncut costs and have revenue uh synergies\n9:05\nbut uh KKR would have cash flow and\n9:07\nleverage. Um\n9:12\nthe bid ceiling that we look to have is\n9:14\naround $12.5 billion\n9:16\nuh for uh Panera just because uh the\n9:20\ninternal rate of return\n9:23\num would drop\n9:26\nuh below 20% if you keep going if you\n9:29\nhave a higher value and you'll have a\n9:31\nlot of uh leverage risk.\n9:35\nuh McDonald's and uh Starbucks can\n9:38\nafford a little bit more because they\n9:39\ncan have uh you know the expected\n9:42\nsavings from synergies into their\n9:43\npurchase.\n9:47\nUh control uh\n9:51\nKar would likely have to pay 20 to 30%\n9:53\nover public trading. It's hard uh it'd\n9:56\nbe hard to\n9:59\nbe a difficult expenditure\n10:01\nuh because if Panera is trading at a\n10:04\nhigh value\n10:06\nand uh\n10:08\nbut McDonald's and Starbucks can kind of\n10:10\njustify it because the long-term value\n10:12\nit could create for them. Um some risk\n10:16\nis a management rollover. Uh it's\n10:19\ncrucial for KKR. It aligns the senses\n10:22\nand it reduces the equity checks. Uh\n10:25\nintegration risk, uh\n10:28\nit's kind of higher for a strategic\n10:30\nbuyer because they'd be more influential\n10:32\nin the company, but it's low KKR because\n10:34\nthe management would be the same. So\n10:38\nthat's kind of be the selling point is\n10:39\nthat uh they wouldn't all be uh fired\n10:42\nafterwards and the management could uh\n10:45\nstay and continue to grow the company\n10:47\nwhile they probably likely get canned in\n10:49\nanother situ another scenario.\n10:52\nSo for the recommendation\n10:55\nuh we'd recommend to submit the bid u it\n10:58\nhas a strong growth thesis and uh you'd\n11:02\nhave to position yourselves as a\n11:03\npreferred partner for management. Uh\n11:07\nfor the valuation of bid strategy, we\n11:09\nwould open with a $12 billion bid, which\n11:11\nis 13.3 times IBIDA. Um it's kind of\n11:15\nnear the precedent transactions, but\n11:18\nstill within our range. Then a target\n11:20\nprice of 12.8 billion. And then that\n11:23\nkind of aligns with our base case DCF of\n11:26\nwhat we believe will happen.\n11:29\nthen walkway price if it's over 13.5\n11:31\nbillion because of the multiple\n11:34\ncompressed exit returns below 20%\n11:37\ninternal rate of return.\n11:42\nUm and so thank you for watching the\n11:44\nvideo. Uh now that we have a a good\n11:47\nunderstanding of uh how Per's uh\n11:52\nvalue is uh the management could then\n11:55\nmake the decision whether to acquire or\n11:57\nnot. thank you for watching."
