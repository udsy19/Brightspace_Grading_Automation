  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs free cash flows, uses a Gordon-growth terminal value, and specifies a discount rate (WACC = 9%) while running scenario and sensitivity analyses. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology across DRIVER stages, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies the FCF components and gives the correct formula (EBITDA → –D&A → NOPAT → FCF = NOPAT + D&A – CapEx – ΔNWC) and implements it in scenario DCFs, then uses those FCFs to derive enterprise value—demonstrating both component mastery and the understanding that FCF drives value to capital providers. These show a thorough, applied grasp meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states a Terminal Value calculation method (Gordon Growth) and shows they parameterized it in the model. They also demonstrate awareness of TV magnitude by sensitivity testing and tracking the terminal value share, satisfying both required points with implementation and validation steps.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast from a terminal period (Gordon Growth referenced) and uses scenario and sensitivity analysis to constrain terminal assumptions, showing correct conceptual multi-stage reasoning. However, the submission lacks detailed, numeric year-by-year growth paths and an explicit justified terminal growth rate, so treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript reports enterprise value outcomes and an EV bid but contains no mention of subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value, nor dividing equity value by shares outstanding to get price per share. Therefore the required EV→Equity bridge steps are missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student constructs enterprise free cash flows and explicitly states a base WACC (9%) and an alternative (10%), and they run WACC sensitivities, showing correct application as the discounting lever. However, they do not provide a clear justification or derivation for the chosen 9% (e.g., industry average or calculated CAPM/debt structure), so the treatment is correct but not fully defended.",
