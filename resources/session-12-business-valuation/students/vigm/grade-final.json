  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the method for intrinsic valuation, implements it with a stated WACC (9%) and reports resulting enterprise values, and reflects on key DCF mechanics (terminal value sensitivity). These concrete choices and interpretation demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly quantifies the terminal value's contribution (~75%) and identifies terminal growth as the key TV method/driver, supported by a DCF implemented in Python and sensitivity analysis highlighting terminal growth and WACC as primary levers. This is a thorough, specific treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly uses at least three valuation methods and reports their value ranges (DCF, comparables, precedents), performs sensitivity analysis on key levers, and synthesizes a defensible final range and recommended bid. Discover/Implement/Reflect evidence shows a thorough triangulation and sensitivity treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used a DCF framework (Discover/Implement) and referenced EBITDA and WACC, indicating partial conceptual grasp. However, they did not explicitly identify FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that free cash flow is the cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows understanding of a multi-stage DCF (objective to build multi-scenario DCF) and cites a short-term growth figure (8%) and business drivers, and it correctly highlights terminal value importance. However, it does not specify explicit forecast-period length or a stated transition/terminal growth rate (nor demonstrate differing short‑ vs long‑term growth assumptions), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript reports enterprise values and a final bid but contains no explicit subtraction of net debt (or debt less cash) to convert EV to equity value, nor any division by share count to produce a price per share. Given those missing steps, the student fails this specific criterion.",
