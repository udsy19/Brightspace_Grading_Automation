  "transcript": "Hi, so today we will be presenting the\n0:08\nvaluation of Panera Bread for a\n0:11\npotential takeover by KKR.\n0:14\nWe will be using three methods, the\n0:17\ndiscounted cash flow, comparable\n0:20\ncompanies, and president transactions to\n0:23\nfind a defensible bid range. Our main\n0:27\nchallenge is balancing KKR's financial\n0:30\ndiscipline against the higher price\n0:33\nstrategic buyers can pay.\n0:37\nPanera is a strong business with 900\n0:41\nmillion in earnings before interest\n0:45\ntaxes depreciation andort amortization\n0:50\nand 8% growth. Past acquisations show\n0:55\nwinning bids are typically 12 to 15\n0:58\ntimes\n1:00\nuh the EBIT TDA.\n1:04\nOur base weighted average cost of\n1:07\ncapital is 9%.\n1:10\nAnd growth is driven by 500 new stores\n1:13\nand scaling their successful digital\n1:17\nplatform.\n1:22\nSo our objectives are clear. Build a\n1:25\nmulti- scenario discounted cash flow\n1:29\nmodel. Run the market comparables and\n1:32\ncritically quantify the value of\n1:36\nuh synergies and the required control\n1:39\npremium.\n1:40\nThis analysis leads directly to our\n1:43\nfinal recommended bid and strategy.\n1:47\nThe initial step fulfills the required\n1:52\ndefine and discover phase of the driver\n1:55\nframework ensuring our project scope\n1:57\ndata and methodology are clearly set\n2:01\nbefore we start building the models.\n2:07\nSo\n2:10\nin the next stage of represent\n2:14\nour plan relies on three core pillars.\n2:18\nThe discounted cash flow flow for the\n2:21\ncompany's true intrinsic worth\n2:23\ncomparable companies for the current\n2:26\npublic market value and the president\n2:28\ntransactions for the takeout takeover\n2:31\nvalue. So we will be combining these\n2:35\nresults to define the final range.\n2:38\nThe models were built in Python for\n2:42\nspeed and accuracy\n2:44\nusing uh Google Collab and Gemini.\n2:50\nThis allows us to quickly change\n2:53\nassumptions like weighted average, cost\n2:56\nof capital or growth rates making the\n2:58\nscenario and sensitivity analysis\n3:01\ndynamic and easy to review.\n3:07\nSo starting the implement phase with the\n3:10\ndiscounted cash flow.\n3:12\nUm let's take a look at the code in\n3:16\ncollab.\n3:18\nSo for KKR\n3:22\nusing a 9% weighted average cost of\n3:24\ncapital Panera's intrinsic\n3:28\nenterprise value is 8.5 billion\n3:32\nas we can see here and\n3:36\num to 9 billion. So it's from 8.5 to 9\n3:40\nbillion. And a key finding is that\n3:44\nlong-term growth driven by the terminal\n3:47\nvalue drives about 75% of this\n3:50\nvaluation. The strategic buyers value is\n3:53\nhigher. A lower 8%\n3:57\nweighted average cost of capital and\n3:59\nquantified synergies of $50 million to\n4:03\n$100 million annually boost the\n4:06\nvaluation of $10.5 billion to 11.5\n4:10\nbillion. So this is a $2 billion\n4:17\ngap represent this $2 billion gap\n4:20\nrepresents the explicit value a\n4:23\nstrategic buyer can realize.\n4:28\nSo\n4:34\nmarket valuation shows comparable\n4:36\ncompanies uh put Panera in the 8.1\n4:40\nbillion to 9.5 billion range. However,\n4:43\nPresident transactions which show\n4:46\nmergers and acquisitions control\n4:48\npremiums\n4:50\nimplied\n4:51\n10.8 8 billion to $13 billion. $13.5\n4:56\nbillion,\n4:57\nwhich is a 12 times\n5:00\nto 15 times earning earnings before\n5:03\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and\n5:06\nmoreization.\n5:08\nThis validates that a winning bid\n5:12\nrequires paying a significant premium.\n5:18\nSo for validation sensitivity analysis\n5:22\nconfirms weighted average cost of\n5:25\ncapital and terminal growth are the\n5:27\nprimary value levers.\n5:32\nOur base enterprise value of $ 8.75\n5:36\nbillion\n5:38\nis too low. It implies only a 9.7 times\n5:44\nlast 12 month earnings before interest,\n5:48\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization\n5:52\nmultip multiple. The required price is\n5:56\nclearly in the 12 times price\n6:00\nplus the 12 times plus multiple range.\n6:06\nThe football field synthesizes the\n6:09\nrange.\n6:11\nFinancial buyer discipline caps the\n6:14\nvalue at 9.5 billion. Strategic value\n6:18\nbegins at $10.5 billion. To evolve our\n6:22\nstrategy, Kareem must act as a quasi\n6:27\nstrategic buyer. By leveraging\n6:31\nBy leveraging the 10% management\n6:34\nrollover, we justify a premium\n6:37\nrationaliz rationalizing a multiple year\n6:40\n12 times earnings before interest,\n6:43\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization\n6:46\nbased on Panera's digital growth.\n6:52\nSo to reflect and conclude,\n6:56\nour recommended final bid range is 10\n7:01\nbillion to 11 billion.\n7:06\nWe propose a winning bid of 10.8 8\n7:10\nbillion\n7:12\nwhich is 12 times the last 12 months\n7:17\nearnings before interest, taxes,\n7:19\ndepreciation\n7:21\nand amortization.\n7:25\nSo this bid is strong enough to beat\n7:30\nfinancial rivals but still financially\n7:35\ndisciplined.\n7:38\nThe driver process that we've used\n7:40\nthroughout this presentation ensured our\n7:44\nvaluation and rational are completely\n7:47\ndocumented and supported by the data.\n7:52\nThank you so much."
