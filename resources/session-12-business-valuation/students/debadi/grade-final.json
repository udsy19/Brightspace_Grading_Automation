  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models unlevered free cash flows, projects them over five years, applies terminal value methods, and uses a stated WACC (with sensitivity). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of DCF mechanics at the introductory level, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly lists FCF components (NOPAT, D&A, capex, changes in working capital) and models unlevered free cash flow in a 5-year DCF to derive enterprise value and an EV-to-equity bridge, demonstrating understanding that these cash flows drive value available to capital providers. The treatment is applied and integrated into valuation workflows (represent/implement/validate), meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes both growth (Gordon) and multiple (exit EBITDA multiple) terminal calculations and explicitly recognizes terminal assumptions as primary valuation drivers, supported by planned sensitivity analysis. This demonstrates a strong, conceptually thorough treatment of the terminal value concept.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual awareness of an EV→equity bridge and even computes an equity reference via P/E, so the basic linkage is present. However, they do not explicitly state subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) from EV nor explicitly mention dividing resulting equity value by share count to get price per share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links WACC to a DCF of unlevered free cash flows and explicitly uses a numeric WACC (~9%) and sensitivity testing, demonstrating conceptual application. However, they do not defend or show a calculated/industry-supported derivation of the 9% WACC, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies market multiples (12–15x EV/EBITDA and 22x P/E) and integrates them into validation and terminal valuation, showing methodological understanding. However, they do not identify specific comparable peers (e.g., Chipotle, McDonald's), so selection of relevant peers is not demonstrated, warranting a PARTIAL.",
