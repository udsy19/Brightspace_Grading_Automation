  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Kyle Sand. This is my\nsection session 12 assignment for\nmanager 310. Today I will deliver a\ncomprehensive business valuation of an\nairbred evaluating a potential takeover\nby KKR using the driver framework.\nSo starting with define discover the\ngoal is to determine a defensive\ndefensive bid range for KKR. As a\nfinancial buyer, we must contrast our\nvaluation against strategic buyers like\nMcDonald's or Starbucks who could pay\nmore due to synergies. Art we have some\ninputs here. So we have uh $6 billion in\nrevenue, 900 million EBITDA,\nwhich is a 15% margin\num and 400 million net income. Our\ngrowth plan management plans to open 500\nnew stores in 5 years and increase the\ndigital sales mix to 70%.\nMarket context uh the industry trades at\na PE of around 22% 22 times will\npresident transaction show EBITDA\nmultiplies of 12 to 15x then the WACC is\nuh 9% which is industry average\nthe core problem is determining how much\nKKR can bid to secure Panera without\noverpaying especially considering that\nstrategic competitors have a synergy\nadvantage we go to phase two to\nrepresent. So moving to represent here's\nthe logic map for my analysis. We have\nthe FCS calculation. I project free cash\nflow by taking EBI bit less taxes adding\nback depreciation is subtracting capex\nand changes in work working capital.\nThen the terminal value I use the Gordon\ngrowth method calculated as 5year FCF\ntimes\n1 plus G divided by the WACC\nminus G. Then the uh valuation we\ndiscounted these cash flows back to the\npresent using our 9% WACC.\nThen the strategic premium I finally I\ncalculate for a 15 to 20% synergy\npremium that strategic buyers might add\nto the valuation.\nMove down to the uh implement part.\nYou'll see the Python later but uh I do\nthese calculations.\nSo the baseline I assumed 8% revenue\ngrowth per the management plan. For\nreinvestment, I use a steady state\nestimates for capex and net working cash\ncapital adjustments roughly equal 2.5%\nof the revenue.\nThen here's the the cash flow in year\none. The revenue grows to 6.48 billion.\nAfter taxes and reinvestment, this\nyields a free cash flow of 567\nmillion. Then by year five, this FCF\ngrows to 771 million.\nUm the terminal value assuming a\nconservative\nconsuming assuming a conservative 2.5%\nterminal growth rate the terminal value\nis 12.16 billion then the total\nsorry\nin the total enterprise value uh\ndiscounting the cash flow of 2.55\nbillion and the terminal value 7.9\nbillion back today our base cash DCF\nenterprise value is 10.545 5 billion.\nThen I compare against the market in the\npresident transactions at 12 to 15x\nEBITDA.\nThe values range from 10.8 billion to\n13.5 billion. Then the trading comps,\nhigh growth peers like Chipotle trade at\nmassive premiums implying valuations as\nhigh as 14 billion.\nMove down to the\nvalidate.\nNow we validate these results by\ntriangulating our values on a football\nfield chart which I'll show in the\nPython. Um the conflict\nKKR is a financial buyer looks at the\nDCF base case of $10.5 billion. We need\na buy low to generate a return on our\ndebt. The competitors strategic buyers\nlike Starbucks and McDonald's look at\nthe synergy or triple valuing the\ncompany between 3.5 13.5 billion and 14\nbillion. This validates that our model\nis realistic but highlights the\ndifficulty of the deal. Our intrinsic\nvalue is lower than the potential market\nprice.\nThen to evolve to ensure robustness I\nevolve the model by stressing stressing\nthese assumptions. The downside risk uh\nif interest rate rates rise in WACC\nincrease to 10% our valuation drops\nsignificantly. As a financial buyer KR\nis highly sensitive to the cost of our\ndebt to the upside potential. However,\nif the digital max hits 70% faster than\nexpected, margins could expand 17%.\nPushing the valuation towards $16\nbillion. This is the growth story. We\nwould need to believe to bid higher.\nThen finally for the reflect\nor our section,\nI'll reflect and offer my\nrecommendations. I recommended\ndisciplined bidding strategy for KKR. Um\nopening bid, we should open with a bid\nof around 11 billion. This is slightly\nabove our base DCF and matches the low\nend of precedent transactions.\nRationale, we must highlight our ability\nto execute the digital transformation\ninternal expansion without the antitrust\nscrutiny. A strategic buyer like\nMcDonald might face the walkway price.\nOur absolute ceiling is $13.5 billion.\nThis is the top of the precedent range.\nWe cannot justify paying more because\nunlike a strategic buyer, we do not have\nexisting supply chains to merge if the\nprice goes to 14 billion and KKR must\nwalk away.\nThat's it for this. So, I'll\nshow you just my script. It shows the\nshows the code, shows all of this that I\nhelped figure out myself. And I'll take\nyou over to the code it ran. And you can\nsee the valuations here on the football\nfield as I said before. And this is the\npublic comps the trans precedent\ntransactions\nin the DCF entries. So here like the\n13.5 is our absolute maxand yeah thank you for your time."
