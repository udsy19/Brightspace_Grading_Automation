  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and computes free cash flows (components listed), applies a terminal Gordon-growth formula, and explicitly discounts projected cash flows using a stated WACC (9%), producing numeric enterprise value outputs. The treatment includes formulas, numeric inputs, and application to a decision (bidding), meeting the thoroughness expected for a pass at the introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies FCF components (EBIT less taxes/NOPAT, addback depreciation, subtract CapEx and ΔWorking Capital) and applies them with numeric FCFs and a discounted enterprise value, demonstrating practical application. Use of WACC to discount to enterprise value indicates understanding that these FCFs are firm-level cash flows relevant to all capital providers.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses the Gordon growth (growth) method and reports a terminal growth rate and terminal value calculation. They also present the present value split (PV of explicit cash flows = $2.55B vs. PV of terminal = $7.9B), implicitly acknowledging the terminal value comprises the majority of enterprise value; implemented calculations and reflections are evident in the Implement and Reflect stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise value results and transaction bid levels but never shows subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value, nor dividing by shares outstanding to produce a price per share. Implement and Reflect stages contain EV figures and bids but lack the required EV→Equity bridge steps, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performs external-style validation by triangulating DCF results against trading comps and precedent transaction multiples and producing a football-field chart, but they do not name specific external sources/tools or data providers. That meets partial credit under the moderate standard (external validation present but not specific), so PARTIAL is appropriate.",
