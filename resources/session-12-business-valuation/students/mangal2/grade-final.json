  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines free cash flow, applies a 9% industry WACC to discount projected FCFs, and implements terminal-value methods and sensitivity analysis. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and implements the standard Free Cash Flow (FCFF) components (EBIT*(1−T), D&A, CapEx, ΔNWC) and codes them into the DCF framework. They also discount FCF to enterprise value and bridge EV to equity by subtracting net debt, demonstrating that FCF is being treated as cash available to the firm’s capital providers. These concrete definitions, implementation, and application justify a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements both Gordon growth and exit-multiple terminal value methods and reports resulting equity/EV ranges, showing computation and application (Implement). They also acknowledge the risk that terminal value can dominate and note checks and adjustment rules in their reflection, demonstrating awareness of TV's typical majority-role and its implications (Reflect/Discover). This is detailed and applied, satisfying PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes subtracting net debt from EV to derive equity value and implemented an EV→equity bridge in their model (meets the first bullet). However, there is no explicit evidence they divided equity value by share count to produce a price per share—equity values are presented in aggregate (PE-based and total equity amounts) but per‑share conversion is not shown, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
