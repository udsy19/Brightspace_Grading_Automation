  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Arian and this is my\n0:04\nsession 12 assignment. So basically uh\n0:07\nwe're seeing that we're um like an\n0:10\nanalyst at KKR which is a big private\n0:12\nequity firm. Uh we want to value Panera\n0:15\nBread um using driver so that we can see\n0:17\nif it's good for a perspective takeover\n0:19\nas a private equity firm. So we want to\n0:21\nmake it we want to use DCFS trading\n0:23\ncomps and the trans preceded\n0:25\ntransactions to produce a brid range.\n0:28\nSo, we're given this deal snapshot.\n0:29\nWe'll dive into it when we go over our\n0:31\ndriver doc. So, we're going to create an\n0:32\nexecutive recommendation that states the\n0:34\nvaluation range, strategy, and rationale\n0:36\nfor choosing financial versus strategic\n0:38\nposition. And these are kind of um what\n0:41\nour guidelines are going to be. But\n0:43\nwe're going to be using driver. We have\n0:44\nused driver to walk through this. So as\n0:48\nyou can see um this is the information\n0:51\nwe are given that we want to get the\n0:53\nenterprise value and equity value range\n0:55\nof uh Panera Bread and we're given that\n0:58\nthey have a $6 billion revenue 8% um\n1:00\ngrowth per year $900 million of earnings\n1:02\nbefore taxes interest um income etc with\n1:05\na 50% margin rate uh net income at 400\n1:07\nmillion there's about 2100 stores uh 50%\n1:10\nof their sales are digital which is\n1:12\npretty high and for some industry\n1:14\nreferences that we can use for the\n1:15\nprocedure analysis\n1:17\nuh the industry price to earnings is 22.\n1:19\nThe precedent or exit value/ ebida\n1:22\nenterprise value is 12 to 15x and then\n1:25\nthe uh two competitors that we going to\n1:27\nuse to compare them are Chipotle and\n1:29\nMcDonald's which is 35x and 25x\n1:31\nrespectfully. Um we're making cap\n1:33\nassumptions of weighted average cost of\n1:34\ncapital in the industry is 9%.\n1:37\nManagement wants 10% rollover and\n1:38\nthere's other strategic biders who are\n1:40\ninterested. Um, we want to incorporate\n1:43\nthe following growth levers into our\n1:44\nscenarios, which is that there's going\n1:45\nto be 500 new stores over five years.\n1:47\nThe digital mix will be up to 70%.\n1:49\nThey're going to look for dinner and\n1:50\ncatering expansions. And they're being\n1:52\nthey're doing an international roll out.\n1:54\nSo, we want to have a multi scenario\n1:58\ndetails, weighted average cost of\n1:59\ncapital justification, and terminal\n2:00\nvalue support. Our trading comps and\n2:03\npreceding attractions will be translated\n2:05\nto valuation ranges. And we're going to\n2:07\nbe looking at it through a financial\n2:08\nbuyer versus strategic buyer lens. We're\n2:10\ngoing to quantify potential synergies,\n2:12\ndiscuss control premiums, integration\n2:13\nrisk, and management rollovers. Um,\n2:15\nwe're going to look for recommended bid\n2:17\nrange, walkway price, negotiation talk\n2:19\npoints, and financing considerations.\n2:21\nAnd we are going to be using the key\n2:23\nassumptions of tax rate, the\n2:25\ndepreciation and amortization percent of\n2:26\nrevenue, the capex percentage of\n2:28\nrevenue, the working capital investment\n2:30\npercent of incre incremental revenue,\n2:31\nthe net debt for equity bridge. So we\n2:34\nfirst want to start with the three\n2:35\napproaches of uh using our discounted\n2:37\ncash flows for five years converting to\n2:39\nfree cash flows discounting at a 9% base\n2:41\nand adding terminal value using the G\n2:43\nmethod and or the exit multiple method.\n2:45\nUh we're going to use trading comps\n2:46\nusing private equity references and\n2:48\nconvert to equity value ranges which is\n2:50\njust a price and earnings ratio times\n2:51\nthe net income. And now for our M&A\n2:54\nwe're going to use the EV and EPA range\n2:55\nof 12 to 15X. Convert to EV by\n2:57\nmultiplying it by EBIDO. And then we'll\n2:59\nbridge our EV to equity minus the net\n3:01\ndebt. So for our VCF mechanics, we're\n3:04\ngoing to forecast, you know, eight years\n3:05\nof growth per revenue, which is what we\n3:06\nhave. Upside is higher growth and margin\n3:08\nexpansion. Downside is the opposite of\n3:10\nthat. Um so we're starting to give it to\n3:12\n900 million to the 50% margin. Uh we're\n3:14\ngoing to convert it to earnings before\n3:15\ninterest and tax only, not depreciation\n3:17\namortization. Um which is an assumption.\n3:20\nNow to define our free cash flow is\n3:22\nbasically just our earnings before\n3:23\ninterest and tax times 1 minus the\n3:25\ncorporate tax rate plus our depreciation\n3:27\namortization minus our capex minus our\n3:29\ndelta net um NWC which is our net um\n3:33\ncap. Then we'll go for terminal value\n3:36\nwhich is uh supported by two methods uh\n3:38\nGordon growth model which is the value\n3:40\nis equal to the free cash flows over the\n3:42\nweighted average cost of capital minus G\n3:44\num and our exit multiple which is our\n3:46\njust our EBID versus times our exit\n3:47\nmultiple. um our financial buyer KKR\n3:51\nvalue stable cash flows and operational\n3:53\nimprovements. They'll they'll play a\n3:54\npremium only if it returns some hurdle.\n3:57\nUh what this means is that um to retain\n4:00\na to control the company, you would have\n4:02\nto buy a lot more shares and KKR is only\n4:04\ninterested in that control of the\n4:05\ncompany. If there's a hurdle with the\n4:08\ncurrent management in KKR's acquisition\n4:11\nplans, um their synergies is eliminated,\n4:13\nwhich means no revenue overlap across\n4:15\nportfolios. Um we're going to we're\n4:17\nlooking at strategic biders as\n4:18\ncompetitors like Starbucks and\n4:19\nMcDonald's. They can justify higher bids\n4:22\nbecause they have the leverages like\n4:23\nsynergies. So procurement scale digital\n4:26\nplatform leverage store off best\n4:27\npractices marketing customer ecosystem.\n4:29\nLike for example,\n4:32\nPanera's 50% uh digital sales aligns a\n4:34\nlot with Starbucks's feature vision of\n4:36\ndigital sales. So Starbucks might just\n4:37\nacquire them because they can combine\n4:39\nthe two and increase their leverage\n4:40\nwhich is something that KKR can't\n4:42\njustify. Um and there's are there are\n4:44\nrisks obviously we have here but we're\n4:46\ngoing to model them as an incremental\n4:48\nIBIDA uplift that a strategic buyer\n4:49\ncould use to capitalize because um it's\n4:53\nalmost like a additional cherry on the\n4:55\ntop almost. So we're going to determine\n4:57\na valuation band from DCS comps and\n4:59\nprecedents and we'll set a recommended\n5:01\nbid range walkway price negotiated\n5:03\nanchors and rollover structures. So\n5:05\nwe're going to implement this with\n5:06\nPython which we have um executed on\n5:07\nGoogle Collab over here. We're going to\n5:09\nshow assumptions block, DCF, FCF builds,\n5:12\nvaluation outputs, trading comps,\n5:13\nsynergy, overlay, sensitivity tables,\n5:15\nand football field chart. Uh what we're\n5:17\ngoing to use is checkpoints to validate\n5:19\nthis. Uh in the driver stage, revenue\n5:20\ngrowth, the lines of scenario\n5:21\ndefinition, 15% even of margins, FCF is\n5:24\ninternally consistent. Terminal value\n5:26\nisn't dominating unrealistically. The\n5:28\nmultiples base values reconcile with DCF\n5:30\norder magnitude and strategic synergy\n5:32\npremium is directionally sensible.\n5:35\nSo we'll go over the model. So we're\n5:36\ndoing the same. We're importing our\n5:37\nlibraries here. We're going to enter uh\n5:40\nassumptions, which is just all the\n5:41\nnumbers that we just went over and\n5:42\noperating assumptions, terminal\n5:44\nassumptions, a balance sheet, bridge,\n5:45\netc. Uh precedent values, which are all\n5:48\npulling through Gemini and Google and\n5:50\nkind of using other examples of previous\n5:51\nsold companies. So, we'll make our core\n5:53\nfunctions in Python over here. So, first\n5:55\nwe're going to have a 5-year projection\n5:57\nequation for revenue and even a margin\n6:00\nand then calculate EBIT using that. Um\n6:02\nthat's use the code for that. Then we\n6:04\nwill build out our free cash flow\n6:06\nprojected cash flow for the year. We're\n6:08\njust saying that EBIDA EBIT is equal to\n6:09\nEBIDA minus the depreciation\n6:11\namotization. Then the taxes on EBIT will\n6:13\njust be 1 minus T * EBIT. So then just\n6:15\nget earnings after tax. So basically get\n6:18\nearnings after tax because we don't tax\n6:20\ndepreciation and amortization. We'll get\n6:22\nearnings after tax time plus\n6:24\ndepreciation and amortization minus\n6:26\ncapex minus uh NWC. Um and then we'll\n6:30\nsay that the NWC is equal the percent of\n6:31\nrevenue a delta revenue times all of our\n6:34\nyears. Then we'll discount these cash\n6:35\nflows for the future. We'll use the\n6:37\nsimple discounted cash flow chart. We'll\n6:40\nuse the Gordon value equation and we'll\n6:42\nuse the exit multiple model to also make\n6:46\ntwo new things and then we'll build\n6:47\nthree cases for DCF for the upside\n6:49\ndownside and um base case. We'll use a\n6:52\nwalk base uh and we'll use the terminal\n6:54\nvalue using Gordon as the primary for\n6:55\nthe terminal value. But we'll also\n6:57\ncompute exit multiple just to compare\n6:58\nR2. Then we will do our trading comp\n7:01\ncomp uh our trading comps for PE to\n7:04\nequity value. And then we'll do\n7:05\npresented transactions just simply\n7:07\nplugging in the values. And then we'll\n7:08\njust look at the synergy and how the\n7:10\nsynergies factor into competitors bids.\n7:12\nAnd then we'll look at the base case\n7:14\nscenario for sensitivity. And then\n7:15\nfinally we'll put this all on a plot\n7:18\nusing base coordinate versus base exit\n7:19\nas our bands. Finally, we have our bid\n7:22\nstrategy output. So we'll recommend the\n7:23\nwhatever bid that the KKR should have.\n7:26\nand we'll go over this. So, our DCF\n7:28\nsummary, we have the downside, base, and\n7:29\nupside values here. Using Gordon, you\n7:31\ncan see the downside is about $8,277\n7:34\nmillion and the upsides is 14,000 with\n7:36\nthe base in the median. Same thing with\n7:38\nthe DCF. Uh, using the exit multiple,\n7:40\nour downside is 11,42 and our upside is\n7:42\n18,570 with the base in the middle\n7:44\nbasically. And for Gordon, using the\n7:46\nequity, um, we get 8,277 as the downside\n7:50\nand 14,15464\n7:52\nas the upside. And again, these are all\n7:54\nin millions.\n7:55\num using exit multiple of 11,4002 versus\n7:59\n18,570 with base in the middle for\n8:02\nterminal value of Gordon 8,989 or\n8:05\n16,7001\n8:06\nand then exit multiple is 13,796 and\n8:09\n23,481 as the upside for our trading\n8:12\ncomps. We are going to basically see the\n8:15\nPE of industry average and our two\n8:17\ncompetitors and we'll have implied\n8:19\nequity value industry average is 8,800,\n8:21\nChipotle 14,000 and McDonald 10,000.\n8:23\nAgain, these are all in millions. Uh for\n8:25\nresident transactions, using a low\n8:27\nvalue, we get the implied EV of 10,800\n8:30\nand the high uh about 13,500. Uh with\n8:33\nour whole synergy thing that we talked\n8:34\nabout about $37.8 million of synergy\n8:37\nebida and value added is 529 million for\n8:41\nthe DCF sensitivity depending on our\n8:42\ngrowth rate of using 02 to 04 and\n8:45\nweighted capital weighted average cost\n8:47\ncapital from 08 to10. We see that 02 and\n8:51\n08 gives us 11,744\n8:54\nu and the lowest value is actually given\n8:56\nby 02 the lowest uh G rate and the\n8:58\nhighest walk rate of 8840.\n9:01\nUm and this is kind of the plot the\n9:02\nfootball field plot we made uh where we\n9:04\nshow the triangulation football field\n9:06\nstyle of the uh ranges and valuations\n9:08\ndepending on how we'd uh calculate and\n9:10\nwhich eases we use. Um so illustrating\n9:14\nthis like overall bid that KKR would\n9:15\nhave to make which we recommend would be\n9:16\nthat their anchor equity value would be\n9:18\n13,220 million their walkway be 15,278\n9:22\nand we would adjust this walkway down if\n9:24\nterminal value dominates or if the\n9:26\ndownside DCF is materally below the\n9:28\nprecedence.\n9:29\nSo we go over our checkpoints again. We\n9:31\nhave revenue growth aligned. Evida\n9:33\nmargin is starting 50%. FCF is\n9:35\ninconsistent. Terminal value is not\n9:37\nunrealistic uh and all these are\n9:39\ncorrect. Now we'll talk about what we\n9:41\ncan do to evolve the model and we'll\n9:42\ncover our final reflect and\n9:43\nrecommendation. So we can add more unit\n9:45\neconomics per store sales openings and\n9:47\nclosures and more area based stuff like\n9:49\nfor example if KKR wants to expand in\n9:51\nthe US how much room is there compared\n9:54\nto the amount of Panera stores\n9:56\nmaintenance versus growth capex. we can\n9:58\nadd like an leverage buyout layer for\n9:59\nKKR so we can kind of see how the debt\n10:02\nfinancing that they would have to\n10:03\nacquire to uh get the company would\n10:05\naffect them and then we would look at\n10:07\nits own segment for international stuff\n10:09\nand kind of estimate our growth rates\n10:11\nthere and if it's worth it. So now for a\n10:15\nreflected recommendation our valuation\n10:17\nrange is going to be between all these\n10:19\nuh numbers we talk about which I'll\n10:20\nbring up here. So for our base uh base\n10:23\nequity value will be 13,320.\n10:25\nOur walkway EV will be 15,278 and then\n10:29\npresident deals and EV we went over in\n10:30\nthe code. So our recommended bid range\n10:33\nwill be centered around the DVS uh so\n10:35\nthe DCF base and president midpoints\n10:37\nwith discipline around the walkway price\n10:39\nwhich is where returns rely on really\n10:41\nheavy upside or terminal assumptions\n10:43\nwhich are unrealistic. So KKR should\n10:46\nexecute um with certainty and speed to\n10:49\nclose. They should have 10% management\n10:50\nrollover and attractive incentive plan.\n10:52\nAnd they should avoid overpaying for\n10:53\nsynergies that they cannot capture. So\n10:55\nbasically what we're saying is that in a\n10:58\ncertain range of the numbers we put here\n11:00\nwith the low to high uh transactions,\n11:02\ncomps, and valuations of the DCF. Um we\n11:05\nrecommend buying it if it's in within\n11:07\nthe range, but we recommend walking away\n11:09\nif it's at this value or above. Uh\n11:11\nespecially because of the synergies that\n11:13\nother companies would have that KKR\n11:14\ncan't overpay for. And again going over\n11:16\nthis, what this basically means is that\n11:18\nlet's say they come up with a sale price\n11:19\nof 16,000 million.\n11:21\nOkay,\n11:22\nit would be wise for KKR to walk away\n11:24\nbecause the extra 800 or so million\n11:27\nfactored in that bid would be by a\n11:29\ncompetitor that has some other use of\n11:31\npair that KKR doesn't, as I said, like\n11:33\nthe digital McDonald's example. So\n11:35\noverall, um it's like a it's like a\n11:37\nmaybe. If they can find the right rent,\n11:38\nthe right price in the right situation,\n11:39\nthen they should. And that that's what\n11:41\nwe just discussed in the numbers here.\n11:43\nSo thank you. And that's my um\n11:45presentation."
