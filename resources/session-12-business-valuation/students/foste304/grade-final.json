  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly performed both terminal value methods with numeric outputs and ran sensitivities, and they clearly acknowledged that terminal value drives most of the DCF and is a key risk. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually solid treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student projected FCFF and applied a DCF using a stated 9% WACC, validated that rate against industry benchmarks, and ran sensitivity tests across alternative discount rates. This demonstrates both correct application (WACC used to discount enterprise cash flows) and a defensible, vetted WACC, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant strategic peers and implemented a comparable methodology by applying trading and precedent multiples (PE ranges) and converting them into implied share prices/football-field ranges. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Validate) show coherent selection, application, and checking of multiples, meeting the introductory comparable methodology standard thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly projects free cash flows and discounts them (shows discounted values and terminal value), and explicitly uses a 9% discount rate (\"walk\"/WACC) with sensitivity testing—demonstrating correct basic DCF mechanics. However the treatment is procedural and lacks deeper conceptual explanation (e.g., composition/justification of WACC or fuller discussion of PV theory), so this meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly projects and uses FCF in a DCF (Implement) and discusses its importance (Discover/Reflect), but they do not identify the constituent components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital. Missing those explicit conceptual elements warrants a FAIL per the rubric.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit 5‑year forecast and a terminal period, runs sensitivities across terminal growth/WACC, and compares assumptions to peers—showing correct conceptual treatment. However, the submission lacks a thorough, explicit justification tying higher short‑term growth to a lower long‑term steady‑state rate with detailed numeric rationale, so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.",
