  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly defines the DCF as discounting future free cash flows to present value and shows the mechanics (FCF formula, terminal perpetuity) and numeric discount rate (WACC = 9.0%) used to compute present values. The IMPLEMENT and REPRESENT stages provide detailed steps and assumptions, demonstrating a thorough, correct introductory-level application of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, ΔNWC) and applies them with concrete capex and working-capital assumptions in the DCF (IMPLEMENT), then discounts those FCFs to enterprise value (REFLECT), demonstrating understanding that FCF drives value available to all capital providers. This treatment is detailed and applied, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates a terminal value using the perpetuity (growth) method, shows the formula and PV, and presents the PV of terminal value versus PV of explicit forecast (6,940M vs 2,560M), demonstrating that TV comprises the majority of enterprise value. The IMPLEMENT stage provides the detailed calculation and the REFLECT/DISCOVER statements show alignment with the DRIVER framework, satisfying a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly moves from EV to an implied equity check by applying a 40% equity / 60% debt capital structure, showing partial command of the EV→equity bridge. However, they do not explicitly subtract net debt (or show cash/debt adjustments) nor divide equity value by share count to produce a price-per-share — therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used a WACC as the discount rate for FCFF and supplied defensible inputs (risk-free rate, beta, MRP, cost of debt, target capital structure), so the conceptual application is present. However, inconsistencies in the cost-of-equity figure and no reconciliation of the stated inputs to the reported 9.0% WACC reduce confidence in the numerical defensibility, so the work merits PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external validation by comparing their DCF to comparable-company multiples and precedent transaction multiples (VALIDATE stage), demonstrating sanity checks against market data. However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Capital IQ, Bloomberg, PitchBook), so the validation is substantive but lacks explicit source attribution required for a full PASS.",
