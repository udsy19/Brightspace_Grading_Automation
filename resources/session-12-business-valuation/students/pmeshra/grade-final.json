You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines FCF and shows the DCF implementation (FCF formula and PV outputs) and separately calculates and justifies WACC using CAPM, applying it as the hurdle rate. Multiple scenario applications, PV results, and validation checks demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (NOPAT, D&A, CapEx, change in working capital) and states FCF represents cash available to investors, then applies FCF values in the DCF—demonstrating both conceptual understanding and practical application (Implement and Represent stages). This meets the thoroughness and application standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates Terminal Value (with terminal growth assumption) and reports its present value and share of enterprise value (76%), plus a benchmark check in the Validate stage. This is a thorough treatment meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates the concept of converting EV into an equity claim by allocating EV into debt and equity (Implement/Evolve), but they do not explicitly subtract net debt (Debt less Cash) from EV nor report shares outstanding or calculate a price per share. Thus the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
