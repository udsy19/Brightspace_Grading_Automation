  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes computing free cash flows from EBITDA (adjusting for capex and working capital) and discounting future cash flows/terminal value using a stated WACC (9%). They also ran sensitivity/scenario analysis and reported the DCF result, showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS at the introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly performed a terminal value calculation (perpetuity growth discounted at 9%) and produced sensitivity analysis focused on WACC and terminal growth, demonstrating awareness that terminal assumptions materially drive enterprise value. The model implementation and reflective heat map provide sufficient depth and application to meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's/Starbucks context) and used precedent multiples (12–15x EBITDA) applied to Panera's $900M EBITDA to produce a $10.8–$13.5B range and a 12.8x implied bid—demonstrating correct, applied comparable methodology. The treatment is concrete with numeric application and synthesis, satisfying a thorough introductory-level approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes FCF from EBITDA and explicitly adjusts for CapEx and working capital, and discounts cash flows by WACC to derive enterprise value (implying firm-level cash flows). However, they do not explicitly mention EBIT/NOPAT or tax adjustments nor reference depreciation; coverage of all FCF components and the explicit statement that FCF is cash available to all capital providers is incomplete, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5‑year forecast from a perpetuity terminal value and uses scenario/sensitivity analysis (Represent/Implement/Reflect). However, they do not present specific, justified short‑term vs long‑term growth rate assumptions or demonstrate higher near‑term vs lower terminal growth with numeric detail, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes and reports enterprise-value outcomes (DCF and transaction ranges) and an offer amount, but nowhere subtracts net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value nor divides by share count to produce a price per share. Therefore the required EV→Equity bridge is missing.",
