  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly identifies DCF as an explicit free-cash-flow-based valuation approach and provides a detailed, defensible WACC construction used to discount cash flows. Represent and Implement stages contain specific, correct methodology and sensitivity/validation discussion, demonstrating thorough introductory-level mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (five-year operating forecast) from a terminal period and uses reasonable multi-stage growth assumptions (higher short-term scenario rates of 5–10% vs. a lower 2.5% terminal rate with GDP rationale). Sensitivity testing of terminal growth and WACC further supports robustness, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses a 9% WACC as the discount rate for enterprise cash flows and provides defensible inputs (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax debt cost, and target capital structure), plus sensitivity testing of WACC. This detailed, applied treatment meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies key FCF components (EBITDA proxy/NOPAT via tax rate, CapEx, and working capital) and builds an explicit FCF in the DCF, and values at the enterprise level (implying cash to all capital providers). However, treatment is not fully thorough: depreciation/D&A and an explicit NOPAT/EBIT reconciliation are not stated, and the discussion is more applied/implicit than comprehensive, so PARTIAL is warranted.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly sets a terminal growth rate and embeds it in a DCF with sensitivity testing, showing understanding and application of the terminal value concept. However, it does not explicitly state that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value—only implied via sensitivity analysis—so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise values and separately reports an equity value via P/E, but there is no explicit subtraction of Net Debt (EV less Debt + Cash) to convert EV to Equity Value, nor any division of Equity Value by shares outstanding to derive Price Per Share. Because both required bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not met.",
