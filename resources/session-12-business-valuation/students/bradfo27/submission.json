  "transcript": "Hi  Dr.  Zang.  Um  this  is  my session  12  assignment. Um  so  to  get  started  for  the  define  and  the  discover  stage.  Um  I  gathered  factual  data  about Panera  bread  to  set  a  baseline  for  valuation.  Sources  such  as  QSR  magazine  show that  Panera  operated about  uh operated  about  2,134 cafes  in  fiscal  2024  with  revenue about  4.6  billion  and  net  income  of  1.33  million. Uh  the  company's  digital  orders  already  accounted  for  roughly  half  the  system  wide  sales. and  management's  rise  plan  uh aims  to  push  system  wide  sales from  approximately  6.1  billion  in  2024  to  over  7  billion  by  2028.  So  collecting  these  data points  provided  context  for  scale, profitability and  growth  ambitions  that  underpin  the  rest  of  the  analysis.  So, we'll  get  into  it  here.  Uh  for  represent  with  the  problem to  find,  I  tran  uh  transit translated  it  into  a  set  of  modeling  assumptions.  I  treated Penera's  revenue  basis  6  billion  uh  midway  between  the  reported revenue  and  system-wide  sales. Uh  and  then assumed  uh  a  15%  EBI  TDA  margin.  I'm  just  going  to  call  that  Ebeta yielding  about  900  million  uh  of a  beta. So,  I  specified  growth  sales  and  margins  for  base  upside  down  and  strategic  energy  scenarios  over  a five-year  horizon  and  set  a  9%  weighted  cost  average  weighted  cost  average  cost  of  capital,  25%  tax  rate  and  2.3  2-3%  terminal  growth  rate.  So,  you'll  be  able  to  see  that  here  in  my code.  the  president  transactions  indicated  about  12  to  15%  times  a  beta  multiples  while  trading  comps  um  range  from  about 22  times  to  35  times  earnings giving  me  benchmarks  for  crossing  the  cross  checking  the  DCF  results.  So,  as  you  can  see  here,  this  is  my  these  are  my  results. Um,  so  to  for  implement,  I  built  a  Python  model  that  projects revenues,  margins,  cash  flows  and  terminal  values  for  each  scenario. The  functions  calculate  yearly  yearly  free  cash  flow,  discount them  by  the  assumed  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  compute  terminal  value  via  an  exit  multiple. Or perpetual  growth  formula.  Running  the  script  produce  um enterprise  values  that  range  from roughly  6.6  billion  to  19  billion  depending  on  the  scenario  uh and  terminal  methodology.  While Comp  suggested  valuations  between  8.8  billion  and  14  billion  yielding  an  overall  football  field  valuation  of  about  So  for  validate  I  validated  the  assumptions  by  combining  them to  the  business  context,  the revenue  growth  trajectory  in  the  base  case uh  alliance  with  management's  goal  of  reaching  7  billion  in system-wide  sales  by  2028, calculated  free cash  flow  value  uh  values  were  checked  against  typical  restaurant  expense  ratios.  I  also  ensured  that  discount  rates  and  terminal  growth  rates  produced  reasonable  terminal  values  and  that  the  DCF  um  outcomes  were  consistent  with  comparable  company  and  President  Trans action  multiples. And  that  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  that  changes  in  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  terminal  growth  move  the  valuation by  roughly  one  or  two  billion  dollars.  So,  for  evolve  to  improve  the  model,  I  would  incorporate  more  granular  cross  structures  cost structures  including historical  depreciation,  cap  back  and  working  capital  ratios  from Panero's  financial  financials.  Future  iterations  can  be  models model  leverage  by  out  financing  explicit  and  explore  a  range  of  debt  levels and  separate  revenue  synergies  from  cost  synergies  for  strategic  buyers.  So  additional  sensitivity analysis  on  store  count  growth, digital  sales  penetration  and margin  improvement  would  help  refine  the  bit  range.  So  for  reflect  overall  the  analysis  analysis  suggests suggests  Panera  standalone enterprise  value  lies  between  about  10  billion  and  17  billion.  A  financial  buyer  like  KKR  should  be  disciplined  targeting  a  bit  around  12  to  13  billion  13  times  the  EB  ITDA.  This  is  to  leave  room  for  operational  improvement especially  since  Panera's  revenues have  slipped  in  recent  years. By  contrast,  a  strategic  buyer could  justify  paying  more  perhaps  up  to  18  billion  if  if  significant  synergies  can  be realized  by  leveraging  pin  has  50%  digital  mix and  strong  customer  base.  Thank you  for  listening  to  my assignment."
