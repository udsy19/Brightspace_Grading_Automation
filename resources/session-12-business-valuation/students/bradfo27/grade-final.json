  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF as discounting projected free cash flows and specifies a WACC (9%) used to bring future values to present, implements a Python model to perform these calculations, and validates results via sensitivity and comp checks — meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast horizon (five-year scenarios tied to management's 2024→2028 sales goal) from a terminal assumption and uses dual terminal methods (exit multiple and perpetual growth). Their chosen terminal growth (≈2–3%) is appropriately lower than short-term explicit growth and they validated results against comps, supporting a thorough multi-stage growth rationale.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulates valuation by comparing DCF outputs to trading comps and precedent-transaction multiples, and reports a justified valuation range (10–17B) plus buyer-specific targets. They also performed sensitivity analysis (WACC/terminal growth effects), demonstrating a thorough, conceptually grounded triangulation and sensitivity assessment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of free cash flow (models FCF and discounts by WACC, indicating cash to all capital providers) but does not thoroughly present the FCF components or an explicit FCF formula (relies on EBITDA margin and defers depreciation, CapEx, and working capital detail). This meets a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations using both exit-multiple and perpetual-growth methods and sets a terminal growth rate, showing implementation and validation (Discover, Implement, Validate stages). However, they do not explicitly state that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF’s value—only that terminal assumptions materially affect valuation—so treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes and reports enterprise values (IMPLEMENT/REFLECT) but never shows subtracting net debt or dividing by share count to derive equity value or price per share. Because the required EV→Equity bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
