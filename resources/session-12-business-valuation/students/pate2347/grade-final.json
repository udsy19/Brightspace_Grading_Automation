You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and constructs free cash flows, states discounting of those cash flows using scenario-specific WACC values (with numeric examples), and applies standard terminal value methods—showing a comprehensive, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly computes terminal value by both growth (Gordon) and multiple methods and explicitly acknowledges that TV comprises the majority (60–70%) of enterprise value, plus performs a reasonableness check—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used WACC to discount enterprise (FCFF) cash flows and provided a defensible base WACC (9%) tied to industry references with scenario adjustments, implemented in their model. Validation comments indicate they reviewed outcomes for credibility, meeting the criterion at a thorough, defensible level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names the key FCF components and states that FCF reflects cash available to all capital providers, demonstrating conceptual understanding. Treatment is accurate but brief (no detailed derivation or worked examples), so it meets the moderate standard for partial credit rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates a 5‑year explicit forecast and a terminal valuation (Gordon growth and exit multiple) and uses plausible short‑term scenario growth rates (5–10%). However, they do not state or justify a lower long‑term/terminal growth rate explicitly or detail the terminal growth assumption, so the multi‑stage growth reasoning is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly acknowledges and produces an \"equity bridge\" and related outputs (EV → equity-related figures) and implemented these in code, but does not explicitly state subtracting Net Debt (debt less cash) nor dividing resulting equity value by share count to report a price per share. This demonstrates correct conceptual awareness but lacks the explicit, detailed steps required for a full PASS.",
