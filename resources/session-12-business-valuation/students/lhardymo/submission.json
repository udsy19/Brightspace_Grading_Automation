  "transcript": "0:02\nUh so today uh for this assignment for\n0:05\nthis business evaluation um we are\n0:07\nlooking at Panera Bread and looking for\n0:09\na prospective uh takeover um using the\n0:12\nframework that we used all semester um\n0:15\nand we're combining uh just DCF\n0:17\ndifferent trading comparisons and\n0:19\ndifferent uh recent transactions um to\n0:22\nsort of produce sort of a bid range um\n0:25\nfor how much this company's worth. Um\n0:27\nand we're also comparing and contrasting\n0:29\nfinancial buyer discipline and strategic\n0:31\nbuyer synergies.\n0:34\nUm\n0:36\nso first\n0:40\num\n0:43\nstay here uh we are looking so first\n0:47\nkind of defining and discovering so our\n0:49\nobjective obviously is to determine a\n0:51\nbid range for Panera Bread um from the\n0:53\nperspective of KKR which we'll say is\n0:56\nour financial buyer um and we're also\n0:58\nanticipating competition from other\n1:00\nstrategic buyers so like Starbucks,\n1:03\nMcDonald's sort of things that kind of\n1:05\nsell similar things to Panera. Um so\n1:09\nfirst dividing our asset that is Panera\n1:11\nBread. Um we have the six billion in\n1:13\nrevenue, the 900 million in um EBITDA\n1:17\nwhich is 15% margin. Um and then also\n1:20\njust our uh growth pile uh profile while\n1:25\num we also have dinner and catering\n1:26\nexpansion with um 500 new stores. Um and\n1:30\nthen we have our market constraints. Um\n1:32\nour industry price earnings ratio is\n1:34\ntrending at 22 times. Um which is pretty\n1:37\ngood. Chipotle is at 35x. McDonald's at\n1:39\n25 sex 25x. Um those are premium\n1:42\noutliers. Um\n1:45\nand our the EBITDA\n1:49\num trades in multiples of 12x to 15x.\n1:52\nWe're going to use kind of that uh those\n1:54\nnumbers. And our cost of capital the\n1:56\nindustry weighted average cost of\n1:57\ncapital is 9%. Um so we and then we also\n2:01\nhave sort of this buyer's dilemma. Um so\n2:04\nuh as a financial buyer you can rely on\n2:06\ndebt payown, operational improvements\n2:08\nand exit multiple. Um however there's a\n2:11\nceiling price to achieve your internal\n2:13\nrate of return. Um and then for\n2:15\nstrategics the competition um their\n2:18\ndilemma is they can pay a control\n2:20\npremium but they realize um hard\n2:22\nsynergies like supply chain cons\n2:24\nconsolidation and removing headquarters\n2:27\ncosts um that you cannot um kind of then\n2:30\nrepresenting kind of using the this\n2:32\ntemplate here. Um first we have our\n2:34\nfinancial modeling architecture. Um, so\n2:37\nI kind of used revenue model um, our\n2:39\nexisting stores times the same store\n2:41\nsales growth to kind of predict sales\n2:44\num, plus all these new 500 new stores\n2:46\nand their times their average unit\n2:48\nvolume um, plus the digital mix. This\n2:50\nwill equal the total revenue go growth.\n2:52\nUm, so kind of combine all these stores\n2:54\ntogether, you know, how much revenue\n2:55\ngrowth are we going to have? Um, and\n2:58\nthen our profitability model. Um, so\n3:01\nsort of using the revenue growth times\n3:03\nthe operating leverage from digital\n3:05\nscale. uh minus the implementation costs\n3:08\nof dinner catering expansion. Um and\n3:11\nthat this will equal the just the\n3:13\nexpanding margins basically. Um and then\n3:17\njust cash flow model uh we have our EBIT\n3:22\num times basically the tax rate plus\n3:24\ndepreciation minus um the uh capital\n3:28\nexpansion for 500 new stores minus the\n3:30\nworking capital for inventory. And this\n3:32\nwill equal our unlevered free cash flow.\n3:35\nUm and then our valuation model um we\n3:37\nhave the free cash flow projection from\n3:39\nyears 1 to five times the discount\n3:42\nfactor at 9% weighted average cost of\n3:44\ncapital uh plus the uh terminal value\n3:48\nand this will equal enterprise value. So\n3:50\nbasically kind of representing all that\n3:51\nkind of setting it up for the code. Um\n3:54\nso you can see here we have our input\n3:56\nparameters um and then our DCF model\n3:59\ncalculations. Um\n4:03\nand then this will kind of evaluate\n4:05\neverything for us. And then um we'll\n4:08\nalso do sensitivity analysis. So as\n4:11\nweighted average cost of capital either\n4:12\nincreases or decreases, how does that\n4:14\naffect total revenue? Um and then also\n4:17\nfor uh looking at uh growth sensitivity\n4:20\nas well. Um\n4:23\nand then we're going to sort of\n4:24\nvisualize with the whole triangulation\n4:26\nthing and sort of give just sort of bid\n4:28\nuh specific bid ranges. um that we can\n4:31\nlike kind of easily look at. Um so you\n4:33\ncan see here all of the output. Um so\n4:36\nfirst you sort of have your projections\n4:38\ntable for the year revenue um EB ITDA\n4:41\nand the free cash flow. Um and so um\n4:45\nobviously this was created with um like\n4:48\nthe collab um and Gemini that kind of\n4:52\nlike put all of these numbers here that\n4:54\nyou can look at. Um and there's the DCF\n4:57\nvaluation results. So you can see kind\n4:59\nof using different um Gordon growth uh\n5:02\nlike model or the exit multiple um you\n5:05\ncan see kind of all of these numbers um\n5:08\nand then also the market valuation\n5:10\nranges. This kind of interesting so you\n5:11\ncan see the trading comparisons on the\n5:12\nindustry average is 22x which relates to\n5:15\n8,800 million. Um and then the\n5:19\npresident's uh so the EBIT TDA with 12\n5:22\nto 15x that's at 10 8 10,800 million or\n5:27\nto 13,500 million. Um so you can see\n5:29\nthat's significantly higher than the\n5:30\ntrading comparisons. Um and then also\n5:33\nthe sensitivity analysis you can see\n5:34\nwhen the weighted average cost of\n5:35\ncapital is at 8 n or 10%. Um that just\n5:38\ngives basically different numbers and\n5:40\nobviously massively affects growth. Um\n5:42\nand then you can see here kind of the\n5:44\ninteresting um\n5:50\nuh sort of being able to visualize the\n5:52\nthe the bid here. Um you can see the\n5:54\nbars over or overlapping lapping around\n5:56\nthe 12 to 13 billion mark. Um and the\n5:58\nstrategy is that the trading comparison\n6:00\nbar will be is that the lowest, the\n6:02\npresident's bars in the middle and the\n6:03\nDCF bar is uh slightly higher on the\n6:05\nright side um because of the assumed\n6:07\ngrowth. Um and so the conclusion is you\n6:10\ncan kind of point to the overlap or the\n6:12\ntriangulation um to justify that $12.5\n6:15\nbillion valuation.\n6:18\nUm\n6:20\nhere\n6:22\num\n6:26\nyeah um and then for validation\n6:30\num\n6:33\num this is kind of just proving that\n6:34\nnumbers are robust and that all the\n6:37\nrisks are understood. So you can see\n6:38\nkind of the triangulation. Um\n6:41\nsort of a sanity check the public we\n6:44\ninclude the public market PE and the\n6:46\nprivate market. Um\n6:49\nand basically this gap of 8.8 billion to\n6:51\n10.8 billion sort of uh shows that\n6:54\nPanera's current net income is\n6:55\nartificially low um\n6:59\nand that we need to rely basically on\n7:00\nother things. And there's also the\n7:01\nsensitivity and risk assessment um kind\n7:04\nof just confirming other conclusions\n7:05\nthat we had. And then basically kind of\n7:07\nevolving, we kind of wanted to look at\n7:09\nsort of the buyer dilemma like financial\n7:11\nbuyers versus the strategic buyers. Um,\n7:14\nand\n7:25\num, basically this the whole concept of\n7:27\nlike evolving the bid structure to\n7:30\ncompete on terms of alignment with\n7:31\nalready like the the big businesses in\n7:34\nlike Starbucks and McDonald's. Um and uh\n7:38\nthey they suggested like a proposed like\n7:40\na 10% management rollover. Um and so\n7:44\nbacking kind of the current team to\n7:46\nexecute the 500 store plan.\n7:49\nUm and then having a strict walkway\n7:51\nprice so that we don't end up going too\n7:53\nhigh. Um and that the riskreward profile\n7:56\nis basically just no longer worth it.\n7:58\nUm, so sort of reflecting here, um, I\n8:02\nthink it was interesting looking at like\n8:04\ndifferent, um, models. I thought this\n8:06\nbar right here was very interesting.\n8:08\nKind of like being able to visualize it\n8:09\nand sort of being able to kind of like\n8:10\nmake a triangle and kind of like look at\n8:12\nthe middle of that I thought was\n8:13\ninteresting. Um, and then just\n8:17\nevaluating businesses as a whole, um, I\n8:19\nthought was really cool and, uh, yeah,\n8:22it was super helpful."
