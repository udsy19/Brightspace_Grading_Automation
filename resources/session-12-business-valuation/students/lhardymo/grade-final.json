  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the present value of projected free cash flows, specifies the cash-flow build (unlevered FCF), and applies a 9% WACC to discount years 1–5 plus a terminal value. They also perform sensitivity analysis on WACC, showing a comprehensive, applied understanding appropriate for an introductory DCF — thus earning PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies EBIT (EBIT × (1−tax)), depreciation, capital expenditures, and working capital in their unlevered free cash flow formula and applies FCF in a DCF to derive enterprise value, demonstrating that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers. This is a comprehensive, applied treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes FCFF and uses WACC (stated as the industry average 9%) to discount those cash flows in the DCF, and also runs sensitivity around 8–10%, demonstrating both application and a defensible industry-based WACC. Coverage is more than cursory (clear application and sensitivity), meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value using both Gordon-growth and exit-multiple approaches and integrates it into enterprise value (IMPLEMENT evidence), but they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value. Given correct method but missing the key conceptual note about TV's usual dominance, the submission meets the criterion only partially.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (years 1–5) and a terminal value and supplies plausible short-term growth drivers (same-store growth, 500 new stores, digital mix). However, they do not provide a detailed, justified terminal/long-term growth rate or explicit rationale showing a lower long-term growth assumption, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly calculates Enterprise Value and presents valuation ranges (IMPLEMENT), but there is no mention or demonstration of subtracting Net Debt (or Debt less Cash) to derive Equity Value, nor dividing by share count to get Price Per Share. Given the absence of the required EV→Equity→Price-per-share bridge, the criterion is not met.",
