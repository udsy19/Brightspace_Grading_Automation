  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, my name is Lucas Casease and\n0:03\ntoday for the week 12 assignment I'm\n0:06\ngoing to be giving uh a presentation\n0:09\nregarding Panera uh and we're going to\n0:11\nbe talking about business valuation and\n0:13\nfinancial modeling.\n0:15\nUm, I'm going to give it in a style that\n0:18\nis an executive recommendation in like a\n0:21\nbusiness meeting setting after I do a\n0:23\nlittle bit of background talking on the\n0:26\nassignment and the in and outs of my\n0:29\nPython code.\n0:32\nSo, first for the assignment overview,\n0:34\nwe're going to be delivering a full\n0:36\nvaluation of Panera Bread for\n0:38\nprospective KKR takeover using the\n0:40\ndriver method and we're going to combine\n0:43\nuh DCF trading comps and president\n0:46\ntransactions to produce an informed bid\n0:47\nrange while contrasting financial buyer\n0:50\ndiscipline with strategic buyer\n0:52\nsynergies. Uh first, a snapshot of the\n0:55\ndeal. uh for scale uh $6 billion of\n1:00\nrevenue growing 8% uh an a bit a bit of\n1:04\n900 million with a 15% margin $400\n1:07\nmillion of net income across 2100 stores\n1:11\nand digital sales are already at 50%. Uh\n1:14\nin regards to the market, the industry\n1:16\nuh price earnings ratio is about 22 uh\n1:19\nwith precedent uh bit multiples of 12 to\n1:23\n15 times. And then Chipotle trades at\n1:26\n35x\n1:28\nprice times earnings and McDonald's is\n1:29\nat 25. And then for some capital\n1:32\nassumptions, we're going to assume an\n1:34\nindustry WACCC of 9%. And management\n1:37\nwants 10% rollover.\n1:40\nAnd uh there are some bitters circling\n1:42\nbeing Starbucks and McDonald's. As for\n1:45\ngrowth levers, 500 new stores within the\n1:47\nnext 5 years, get a digital uh mix sales\n1:51\nto 70%. Uh expand into dinner and\n1:55\ncatering and start an international roll\n1:58\nout. Uh so my final recommendation will\n2:02\nbe an executive ready recommendation\n2:03\nthat states my valuation range as well\n2:07\nas choosing between financial and\n2:09\nstrategic positioning.\n2:12\nUh now behind the scenes\n2:14\num on the left here you'll see the\n2:17\nPython code that I uh generated using\n2:21\nGoogle Collab in order to do my DCF\n2:25\nscenario calculations.\n2:27\nAnd on the right you will see the\n2:30\nnumbers for the scenarios.\n2:33\nUh for the base case revenue growth is\n2:36\nat 8% the bit the margin is.15\n2:39\nwith ex exit multiple of 13.5 and\n2:43\nobviously the wcc of 9%. The upside case\n2:48\nuh revenue growth is higher, the bid to\n2:50\nmargin is higher, the exit multiple is\n2:52\nhigher and the WACC is slightly lower\n2:55\nand for the downside case the revenue\n2:57\ngrowth is obviously uh lower than the\n3:00\nbase case the bit is lower than the base\n3:02\ncase as is the exit multiple and then\n3:04\nthe WACC is slightly higher.\n3:07\nUh this last behind the scenes before we\n3:09\nget into the recommendation,\n3:11\nthis is the code behind uh my heat map\n3:16\nand football field, which is what we'll\n3:19\ncall it. Um those will be at the end of\n3:21\nthe presentation and it'll show it'll\n3:23\nline out all the data.\n3:26\nUh now for\n3:28\nthe presentation, uh good afternoon.\n3:32\nBased on uh my comprehensive evaluation\n3:34\nof Panera Bread, I recommend an opening\n3:36\nbid of 12.5 billion dollars. It places\n3:40\nus within the range of president\n3:42\ntransactions. Uh but it also\n3:44\nacknowledges the premium required to\n3:46\ncompete in today's market. Uh my\n3:49\nanalysis does highlight a critical risk\n3:51\nthat there is a massive valuation gap\n3:53\nbetween a financial buyer like KKR and a\n3:56\nstrategic buyer like Starbucks.\n3:59\num if the price exceeds $14.5 billion,\n4:02\nwe would lose our margin of safety and\n4:05\nwe should walk away. And now I'm going\n4:08\nto walk through the numbers that drive\n4:10\nthe recommendation.\n4:11\nSo on screen here, you will see the\n4:14\nresults of my DCF scenarios.\n4:17\num on the top the base case uh that puts\n4:22\nthe enterprise value at around 13.9\n4:26\nbillion with an implied bit multiple of\n4:28\n10 and a half. Uh the present value of\n4:32\nfuture cash flows is around 2.3 billion\n4:36\nand the year five a bit a bit would be\n4:40\nuh 1.3 billion.\n4:42\nUh now for the upside case uh the\n4:45\nenterprise value is $21 billion with an\n4:48\nimplied a bit multiple of 12.3 and the\n4:51\npresent value of future cash flows is\n4:53\naround 3 billion with a year five a bit\n4:56\nof 1.7 billion. Uh lastly the downside\n5:00\ncase which would be if a recession\n5:01\noccurs the enterprise value of Panera\n5:04\nBread would be $6.7 billion with an\n5:07\nimplied a bit the multiple of 8.1 and\n5:10\nthe present value of future cash flows\n5:12\nwould be around $1.6 billion and the\n5:14\nyear five a bit would be around 800\n5:19\nbillion. Um so we anchored our valuation\n5:23\non the multi scenario DCF engine use uh\n5:26\nthat I mentioned previously that I\n5:29\nshowed the code for uh\n5:33\nthe AIDA multiple for the base case is\n5:37\nattractive compared to the industry\n5:39\naverage of uh 22x which we mentioned at\n5:42\nthe start. Um and then the strategic\n5:45\nthreat here for uh the base case\n5:48\nscenario is that a strategic buyer can\n5:50\nunlock the synergies such as supply\n5:53\nchain integration and overhead reduction\n5:55\nthat would push margins to 18%.\n5:58\nUh this is how we got to our upside case\n6:01\nand we can't compete with that number on\n6:03\na pure cost of capital basis. So in\n6:06\norder to win the deal, we would have to\n6:08\nget in quick uh and with deal certainty\n6:12\nand not be concerned about the price.\n6:15\nAnd then the last scenario is obviously\n6:17\nif there is a recession, we wouldn't\n6:18\nreally be in a position to acquire\n6:22\nuh Panera anymore.\n6:25\nUh now on the screen we have the heat\n6:28\nmap that I also showed the code behind.\n6:31\nUm on the x-axis you'll see the terminal\n6:34\nmultiples and on the uh y-axis you'll\n6:37\nsee the WACC percentages.\n6:40\nUh as you see the colors range from\n6:42\npurple to yellow with blue and green\n6:44\nbeing in the middle. Purple has the uh\n6:47\nlowest enterprise value sensitivity and\n6:50\nyellow is the highest as terminal\n6:52\nmultiple and WAC as terminal multiple\n6:55\nincreases in WACCC decreases.\n6:58\nUm\n6:59\nbefore finalizing the bid, I stress\n7:01\ntested our base case to ensure we\n7:02\nweren't overpaying. And if you look at\n7:04\nthe matrix, you will see even if the\n7:07\nexit environment cools down to a 12x\n7:09\nmultiple uh and the WACC increases, the\n7:13\nasset would still hold a value of\n7:16\nroughly 12 billion. Uh this confirms\n7:20\nthat my bid recommend my opening bid\n7:22\nrecommendation of 12 and a half billion\n7:23\nis aggressive but defensive because it's\n7:26\nsupported by the heat map on screen and\n7:29\neven if the mark market multiples\n7:31\ncompress during our holding period. Uh\n7:35\nlastly on screen you'll see the football\n7:38\nfield chart that I mentioned before.\n7:40\nThis just shows uh the valuation ranges\n7:43\nuh for all the cases again and it also\n7:45\nincludes some valuations of the uh other\n7:50\ncomparables for us to look at. So you'll\n7:52\nsee uh obviously the upside case is the\n7:55\nhighest and below that we have our\n7:57\ntrading comp of Chipotle which is those\n8:00\nare the only two that are uh above the\n8:02\nbase case. Uh below our base case\n8:04\nscenario we have other comparables uh\n8:08\none being our the president trends with\n8:11\nhigh and then the McDonald's trading\n8:14\ncomposition\n8:16\nand uh the industry average and lastly\n8:20\nour worst case scenario would be the DCF\n8:22\ndownside case of the recession.\n8:26\nUh so just bringing it all back into\n8:29\nview uh my recommendation is that we\n8:31\nenter at 12.5 billion dollars. uh we\n8:35\nhave room to negotiate up to 13.9\n8:37\nbillion which is our intrinsic value and\n8:40\nI believe our walk rate price should be\n8:42\naround 14 or any bid above 14.5 billion\n8:45\nbecause it uh uh is very bad for our\n8:49\ninternal rate of return and hands the\n8:51\nvalue over to the seller and we can let\n8:54\nthe strategics people like Starbucks\n8:56\nhave it. Uh so finally regarding deal\n8:59\nstructure and financing uh we are\n9:02\nrequiring the management team to roll\n9:04\nover 10% of their equity uh which just\n9:06\naligns the incentives and reduces\n9:09\ninitial c cash outlay and for financing\n9:12\nwe anticipate funding this transaction\n9:15\nuh should we should use roughly 60% to\n9:18\n40% debt to equity given Panera's strong\n9:21\ncash flow uh if you recall at the start\n9:24\n900 million aida uh the company can\n9:26\nsupport this leverage and it'll help\n9:29\nensure we hit our return targets without\n9:31\noverstressing the balance sheet.\n9:35\nUh thank you so much for your time. Uh I\n9:38\nhope you enjoy looking through all my\n9:40\nPython model and scenario toggles and\n9:43\npending your questions. That is my\n9:46\nrecommendation for our opening bid if we\n9:48\nwere to take a shot at Panera. Thank\n9:51\nyou."
