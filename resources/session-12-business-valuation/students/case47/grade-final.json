  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and uses an industry WACC (9%) as a capital assumption, applies it across DCF scenarios (base/upside/downside) and performs a WACC-by-terminal-multiple sensitivity heat map. This shows a defensible WACC choice and practical application as the discount rate for FCFF, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, industry average, precedents) and explicitly used multiples (exit multiple 13.5, industry P/E ~22, implied multiple ~10.5) in valuation and sensitivity analysis. Combined with the implemented code/heat‑map and football‑field, this demonstrates a thorough, applied comparable‑methodology at an introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedents), reported specific DCF scenario outputs and performed sensitivity testing (heat map), and reconciled results into a clear recommended bid range and walk-away threshold. This is a thorough, well-supported treatment satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF outputs as the present value of future cash flows and explicitly uses a WACC assumption and WACC sensitivity in scenarios, demonstrating conceptual correctness and applied implementation. However, the treatment is not thorough (limited explanation of FCF construction, discounting mechanics, or detailed linkage), so it meets a correct but basic level rather than the comprehensive depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Although the student ran a DCF and referenced \"future cash flows,\" the submission never explicitly identifies FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor states that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. Use of the driver method and code is clear (Discover/Implement) but the required conceptual components are missing, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value via an exit/multiple method (exit multiples shown and used in a heat map) and provides PV of projected cash flows versus enterprise value, which implies the terminal portion dominates. However, they do not explicitly discuss or explain that the terminal value typically represents the majority of the DCF value or explore the implications in depth, so the treatment is correct but not thorough.",
