  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames the valuation as a DCF and provides a DCF formula that uses FCFT and WACC, cites a numeric WACC assumption, and shows discounted terminal/valuation results. While some notation is messy, the submission demonstrates correct conceptual use of present-value free cash flows and discounting with WACC, meeting the introductory-level criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and provided industry multiple ranges, then applied both P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples to the company's net income and EBITDA with numeric calculations and valuation ranges, demonstrating thorough and correct application of introductory comparable methodology.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly defines key parameter inputs (growth, multiples, WACC) and uses a DCF/comps framework, providing numeric low/high cases and a recommended bid range—demonstrating the model responds to input variations. While some arithmetic/reporting is sloppy, the conceptual parameterization and scenario-driven outputs meet the moderate standard for thoroughness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding that discounted free cash flow (FCFT) is used to derive enterprise value (EV) and thus reflects value to capital providers (evidence: EV = FCFT discounted by WACC). They apply EBITDA after tax and include capex in the FCFT calculation, but they do not explicitly account for depreciation or changes in working capital nor fully articulate NOPAT vs. depreciation adjustments, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly calculates a terminal value (formula + specific TV numbers), showing implementation of the TV concept. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value normally constitutes the majority of a DCF's value — the dominance is implied by the large TV figures but not discussed conceptually, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly implements a forecast period (multi-year projection) and computes a terminal value, showing partial multi-stage reasoning. However, they do not explicitly justify or document a declining long-term/terminal growth rate or explain why short-term growth is higher than terminal — assumptions and rationale for stage-specific growth rates are incomplete.",
