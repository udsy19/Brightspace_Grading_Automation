  "transcript": "0:00\nToday we are going to do our last\n0:03\nassignment, our session 12 assignment.\n0:05\nWe're first going to start by doing this\n0:07\nby going over what the assignment gave\n0:09\nus and information what we're supposed\n0:10\nto do. So this assignment for our last\n0:13\none is a comprehensive business\n0:15\nvaluation. So we are supposed to deliver\n0:17\na full valuation of pay for prospective\n0:20\nKKR takeover using driver framework. We\n0:24\nwant to combine the DCF trading comps\n0:26\nand precedent transactions to produce an\n0:28\ninformed bid range while constraining\n0:31\nfinancial buyer discipline strategic\n0:33\nbuyer synergy. Here's a deal. Here is\n0:36\nthe deal snapshot. I'm not going to\n0:38\nspecifically go over this, but it's\n0:39\nshown on screen, but I used all this\n0:42\ninformation of course in my analysis.\n0:44\nAnd then the goal is to create that\n0:46\nrecommendation that states valuation\n0:48\nage, winning bid strategy, and rational\n0:50\nfor choosing financial versus treat\n0:52\npositioning. Now going into the\n0:54\nassignment, I'm going to start off with\n0:56\nmy final answer, then dive into my\n0:59\ndriver framework, and through that I'll\n1:00\nshow you my code, my explanation of the\n1:02\noutput, and the financial concepts\n1:04\nbehind this analysis.\n1:06\nSo my final answer is based on the\n1:09\ntriangulation of the discounted cash\n1:11\nflow DCF, trading comparables, and the\n1:14\nprecedent transactions, I recommend the\n1:16\nKKR submit a bid in the range of 11.8\n1:20\nbillion to 12.8 billion. So there's a $1\n1:22\nbillion $1 billion range and the\n1:25\nvaluation ceiling is 13.5 billion\n1:27\nimplied by the 15 times EBIT DA. Going\n1:31\nabove this erodess the financial buyer\n1:34\nreturns\n1:37\njust making sure it's still recording\n1:40\nunless significant operational cost\n1:42\ncutting is achieved immediately. And in\n1:45\nthe reading strategy, the positive KKR\n1:47\nis a partner to unlock the digital and\n1:50\ndinner growth levers without the\n1:52\nscrutiny of public markets.\n1:55\nFinally, the financial versus strategic\n1:57\nport we wanted to analyze. Strategic\n1:59\nbuyers like McDonald's and Starbucks\n2:01\ncould pay up to 15 billion plus due to\n2:04\nsynergy, supply chain integration,\n2:07\noverhead.\n2:09\nBut KKR cannot compete on that price\n2:11\nalone. and KKR must compete on speed of\n2:14\nexecution, management incentives like a\n2:17\n10% rollover and allowing current\n2:19\nmanagement to retain operational\n2:21\ncontrol.\n2:23\nNow diving into the driver framework, I\n2:25\nalready kind of did this but I going\n2:27\nbefore me doing this assignment, I\n2:29\ndefined the goal determine the\n2:31\ndefensible bid price for Panera Bread\n2:32\nfor KKGR. The context was paneer has\n2:36\nstrong fund fundamentals but requires\n2:39\ncapital for expansion of the 500 new\n2:41\nstores and the constraints was\n2:45\nthere this is a financial buyer the high\n2:47\ncost of capital requirement IRR than the\n2:51\nstrategic competitors of Starbucks and\n2:54\nMcDonald's. Next in the draw framework\n2:56\nrepresenting I had to make out a plan\n2:58\nfor my methodology. We will use three\n3:00\nvaluation methods to triangulate the\n3:02\nvalue. I mentioned these in the\n3:03\nbeginning. The DCF the intrinsic value\n3:06\nbased on the future cash flows for a\n3:07\n5-year projection. the trading comps,\n3:10\nmarketing price of peers of Chipotle and\n3:12\nMcDonald's, precedent transactions, what\n3:15\nsimilar companies sold for, total times\n3:17\n15 times the E bit da and then the tools\n3:21\nwe wanted to use Python of course and\n3:23\nthe sensitivity analysis changing the\n3:25\nWACC and visualizing the field chart\n3:28\nquote unquote.\n3:30\nNext, of course, driver framework would\n3:32\nimplement it. Um, and that involved\n3:34\nusing Google Cloud to build the cash\n3:35\nflow free cash flow model and doing the\n3:38\nsensitivity analysis. And here I will\n3:40\nshow you the code imported the necessary\n3:42\nlibraries. And again, I formatted the\n3:45\ncode as if it was a driver framework.\n3:50\nAnd\n3:52\ncontinuing on, we have all the figures\n3:55\nwe were given in the problem here listed\n3:57\nin the beginning. Then we have the\n3:58\ngrowth levers of the base upside and\n4:01\ndownside for different scenarios. So\n4:03\nthat's how we wanted to involve our\n4:05\nanalysis. Then we also have the\n4:07\nvaluation multiples for market\n4:09\nreferences.\n4:10\nNext we want to implement the DCF\n4:12\nengine. So we want to calculate the DCF\n4:15\nand that's shown at the five projection\n4:17\nhere. It's a formula\n4:21\nand then simple loop for projections\n4:24\nfor each year. And then that that would\n4:26\nhelp calculate our revenues. Then we\n4:29\nalso have the terminal value calculation\n4:32\nhere which is shown right here. And then\n4:34\nthe discounting factors and the present\n4:36\nvalue calculations. And finally got our\n4:39\nprice values. And I'll explain those\n4:40\nfinancial concepts in depth in a second.\n4:43\nNext we have to validate for sensitivity\n4:45\nanalysis. And then here we so we have a\n4:47\ndifferent WACC range and growth ranges\n4:50\nto perform that sensitivity analysis.\n4:54\nAnd then for evolving triangula say\n4:56\ntriangulation and visualization we have\n4:59\nthe gener generation of the graph and\n5:02\nyou can see all the value all the DCF\n5:04\nvalues being calculated precedence\n5:08\nand here we have the trading comps and\n5:11\nthe data for the plotting and the\n5:12\nvisualization code is right here and\n5:14\nthen we also have this the strategic\n5:16\nversus financial annotation right here.\n5:21\nOkay. Now going into our actual output,\n5:25\nwe have the checking of the base inputs.\n5:27\nAlways important to validate that. And\n5:29\nthen here we have the sensitivity\n5:30\nanalysis for the validation stage. And\n5:33\nthen here we see this is showing us the\n5:35\nimpact of the WACC in terminal growth\n5:37\nevaluation.\n5:39\nSo uh for the term growth we have four\n5:41\ndifferent term growths of 0.02 02\n5:45\n025 and 03 and then the WWE's\n5:49\nof\n5:51\n0809 and 010.\n5:54\nSo I won't really list out all these\n5:55\nnumbers but we can see that\n5:59\n03 term growth in the 08 WACC results in\n6:03\nthe largest value um and impact which is\n6:07\nimportant to know and then the lowest is\n6:10\nover here with the greatest WACC of10\n6:14\nand the lowest term growth. That's an\n6:17\nimportant pattern to notice. Now for the\n6:19\nexecutive summary of\n6:22\nour output the base case DCF valuation\n6:25\nwas 7.37 billion and the implied EBIT DA\n6:29\nmultiple was 8.2x\n6:32\ntimes in the strategic versus financial\n6:34\nrecommendation was that for financial\n6:37\nbinder KKR a strict discipline is\n6:40\nrequired the bid range should be what I\n6:43\nsaid in the beginning 11.8 billion to\n6:44\n12.8 8 billion. And the rational is that\n6:47\nat 13 times eBay DA returns rely\n6:50\nentirely on perfect execution of the 500\n6:52\nstore expansion is sometimes hard to\n6:54\naccomplish. And for more strategic buyer\n6:57\nlike Starbucks and McDonald's, they are\n6:59\nlikely to bid at something more like 14\n7:02\nbillion plus joined by synergies. But\n7:05\nKKR would never be able to win a price\n7:07\nwar. They must win on speed and mansion\n7:10\nfit which is the goal with that. at the\n7:12\nwinning strategies to pitch the digital\n7:14\nand dinner expansion. That's something\n7:16\nthat not a lot of companies are doing.\n7:18\nSo there's a hole in the market for that\n7:20\nand also emphasize the 10% management\n7:23\nroll over to incentives.\n7:26\nSo here is the graph I was talking about\n7:29\nearlier and this is the recommended KKR\n7:31\nbid of 12.5 million as you can see in\n7:34\nthe top right corner and then here we\n7:36\nhave the trading comps the precedent\n7:39\ndeals and then the DCF downside and\n7:42\nupside and I'll explain the this graph\n7:43\nmore in a second but I want to first get\n7:46\ninto more of the financial concepts but\n7:49\nfirst the validation framework and the\n7:51\ndriver framework was sensitivity\n7:53\nanalysis we tested at the UACC increases\n7:56\nto 10% or if the terminal growth slows.\n8:01\nWe also did a C90 check. Does the DCF\n8:03\noutput alignment 12 times 15 times\n8:06\nmarket reference.\n8:10\nWe evolved this from a basic calculation\n8:12\nto different scenario planning. The base\n8:15\ncase standard growth the upside\n8:16\nstrategic height digital adoption store\n8:18\nexpansion success and the downside\n8:21\nrecession and margin compression. And\n8:24\nI'll get into my reflection in the end\n8:26\nof the video. But going into more of the\n8:29\nfinancial analysis and math exploration,\n8:34\none of the big concepts of course in the\n8:35\ntriangulation is a discounted cash flow.\n8:38\nThe DCF calculates intrinsic value of\n8:40\npaneer bread based on its ability to\n8:42\ngenerate cash. And that formula for free\n8:45\ncash flow FCF is the E bit times 1 - tax\n8:48\nrate plus DNA minus cap X\n8:53\ncapital exponential minus delta change\n8:55\nin the NWC\n8:57\nand why we need this unlevered cash flow\n8:59\nto value the whole business not just the\n9:02\nequity also the terminal value is\n9:05\nanother calculation we use for analysis\n9:06\nand that's the FCF of the final year\n9:10\ntimes 1 plus G / WC minus G. In that\n9:14\nassumption, we assumed Panera grows our\n9:17\nmodest rate G forever after year five.\n9:20\nAlso discounting a very important\n9:22\nfinancial math concept. We pull future\n9:24\ncash back to today's dollars using WACC\n9:27\nweighted average cost capital that we\n9:28\ntalked on a different assignment at 9%.\n9:32\nNext, the comparable and preent\n9:34\nanalysis. We use trading comps. We look\n9:37\nat the price per earnings in EBIT DA\n9:40\nmultiples of the totally 35 times is a\n9:42\nhigh growth outlier while the industry\n9:45\naverage is the 22 times and that's more\n9:47\nof a safe baseline\n9:49\npresident transactions historic deals in\n9:51\nthe sector happened at the 12 times to\n9:53\n15 times EBTA and then that 900 million\n9:56\nEVA times the 12 to 15 times gave us the\n9:59\n10.8 8 billion and 13.5 billion\n10:01\nrespectfully respectively. Sorry.\n10:05\nNext, financial versus strategic buyer\n10:08\nlogic. That was something we really\n10:10\nwanted to hone in on in this assignment.\n10:12\nFinancial buyer KKKR\n10:14\nfocuses\n10:16\non cash flow and that risk is high\n10:19\nleverage. Valuation lower because we\n10:22\nstrictly look at the standalone ability\n10:24\nof Payard to pay down debt. And the\n10:27\nmanagement rollover though is the KKR\n10:29\nwants a 10% pullover to keep management\n10:31\nskin in the game which is where they can\n10:35\nmake their option better.\n10:38\nfor strategic buyers Starbucks and\n10:40\nMcDonald's. They focus more on synerg\n10:42\nsynergies versus cash flow and the\n10:45\nsynergies mean the cost savings, supply\n10:47\nchain, headquarter reduction, revenue\n10:49\nsynergies like selling Panera coffee and\n10:52\nStarbucks and the valuation is higher\n10:55\nbecause they can add the net present\n10:57\nvalue of these synergies to their bid.\n10:59\nOkay, now I want to explain the analysis\n11:03\nof our model right here more because\n11:06\nthere's so much nice information that we\n11:08\ncan visually see in this compared to\n11:10\njust me explaining it. Um,\n11:14\nand the model reveals a massive\n11:16\ndiscrepancy that drives the KKR strategy\n11:19\nas the intrinsic value DCF base gate\n11:23\nbase case is a 7.4 4 billion\n11:25\napproximately and the market price for\n11:26\nthe president and/ comps is 11 billion\n11:29\nto 13.5 billion and that has 8.2 2 EBTA\n11:33\nthen 12 to 15 again respectively\n11:36\nand what that told me is if KKR bids\n11:39\nbased strictly in the base case DCF they\n11:41\nwill lose the deal immediately and the\n11:44\nmarket is pricing Paner Panera at a\n11:46\npremium why is the DCF lower though the\n11:49\nDCF uses a perpetuity growth method\n11:52\ngrowing 2.5% forever this is\n11:55\nconservative relatively in the market\n11:57\npresident transactions is paying for\n11:59\nstrategic value and aggressive future\n12:01\ngrowth that a scanner DCF doesn't\n12:03\ncapture without aggressive inputs.\n12:06\nNow, further explanation on the\n12:07\nsensitivity analysis\n12:10\nand that just shows that with the WACC\n12:13\nsensitivity, moving from 9% to 10%\n12:16\ngetting bigger, rising interest rates\n12:18\ncrashes the value from 7.37 billion to\n12:20\n6.38 billion. So increasing WACCC's\n12:24\nlowers SI value and yeah\n12:31\nsorry and then the growth sensitivity\n12:33\nchanging terminal growth from the 2.5 to\n12:36\n3% only adds a point approximately.5\n12:39\nbillion and this shows that simply\n12:41\nhoping for more growth isn't enough to\n12:43\njustify the high price. You need\n12:45\noperational improvements margin\n12:48\nexpansion.\n12:51\nNext, I wanted to explain the chart a\n12:53\nlittle bit more and that is this chart\n12:57\nright here\n12:59\nand explain the different components of\n13:00\nit.\n13:04\nThe DCF downside minus outside upside\n13:07\nbar is the 4.38 billion to 10.3 billion\n13:11\nbarely touches the precedent deals bar\n13:12\nof the 10.8 8 billion to 13.5 billion\n13:16\nwhich is this is the DCF bar and then\n13:19\nthis one right here is the president\n13:21\ndeals bar\n13:24\nand then the recommended bid and that's\n13:25\nthe bit I put for the graph at the 12.5\n13:28\nbillion which is a red line right here\n13:30\nas you can see the DCF doesn't touch\n13:32\nthat red dash line\n13:36\nso that's why we were recommending that\n13:38\nthe 12.5\n13:42\nbillion ion dollar because we\n13:44\nacknowledge that this is a premium above\n13:46\nthe standalone DCF value. But to bridge\n13:48\nthis gap and generate a return, KKR\n13:50\ncannot just be a passive investor. They\n13:53\nmust actively pull the growth level,\n13:55\nspecifically the $5,500 store exchange\n13:57\nand digital ship, the dinner and digital\n14:00\nthing to move the company's future\n14:02\nperformance into the upside territory.\n14:05\nAnd then that could be seen in the graph\n14:06\nright here with this recommended red\n14:09\ndashed line.\n14:11\nFinal summary. Is the DCF wrong? No. It\n14:14\nrepresents the store value when it needs\n14:16\nto be above. It's a bit too high. It is\n14:18\nexpensive at your 13.8%\n14:21\ntimes implied EBITA, but it is a market\n14:24\ncleaning price to compete with with\n14:26\ncompetitors.\n14:28\nMy conclusion is this output proves that\n14:30\nthe financial buyer KKR has a harder\n14:32\npath than the strategic buyer, which is\n14:34\nto be expected. But the strategic buyer\n14:38\nlike McDonald's could pay 14 billion\n14:40\nbecause they have cost synergies that\n14:42\ninstantly decrease the DCF. KKR does not\n14:45\nhave the synergies. So KKR must rely on\n14:48\nbetter management and operational\n14:50\nefficiency to win. That's what I want\n14:52\nyou to take away. KKR a strategic buyer\n14:55\nthat's trying to compete with a\n14:56\nfinancial buyer must rely on better\n14:58\nmanagement and operational efficiency.\n15:01\nAnd that's my main takeaway from this\n15:03\nassignment. I'm quickly going to\n15:04\nconclude this with the orange framework.\n15:07\nSame thing. Financial buyer is\n15:10\ndisciplined by debt cap capacity and\n15:12\nexit returns. So we need to interpret\n15:14\nthe data to find a price where we can\n15:15\nexit in five to seven years prior to\n15:17\nprofit. And strategic buyers will\n15:18\ninevitably view this differently as they\n15:20\npay for synergies. And that's my final\n15:23\nrecommendation is the bid in the range\n15:24\nof 11.8 billion to 12.8 billion. Thank\n15:27you so much for listening."
