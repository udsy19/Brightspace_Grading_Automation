  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present-value of future free cash flows, presents the FCF/terminal-value formulas, implements a modeled DCF, and uses WACC (with numeric examples and sensitivity analysis) to discount cash flows. This is a thorough, applied introductory treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the FCF components (EBIT*(1–tax), D&A, CapEx, ΔNWC) and labels it as unlevered cash flow used to value the whole firm, then implements those concepts in a coded DCF with sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a correct and applied understanding of the FCF concept at a level that satisfies a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission includes an explicit terminal value formula and applies multiple terminal growth/WACC scenarios (sensitivity analysis), demonstrating the TV calculation and its outsized impact on valuation. The student also reflects on how terminal assumptions drive the DCF versus market prices, satisfying a thorough conceptual treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding that unlevered DCF and EBITDA multiples value the whole business (enterprise value) and produces transaction-level valuations, supporting partial credit. However, they do not explicitly show the EV→Equity bridge steps required by the criterion (no explicit subtraction of net debt nor division by share count to get price per share), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly performed validation activities (sensitivity analysis, C90 check, and comparison to comps/precedents), but did not name specific external sources, calculators, or websites used for external confirmation. Under the moderate standard, this is sufficient for partial credit but not a full PASS.",
