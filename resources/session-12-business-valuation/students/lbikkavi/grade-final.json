  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly modeled a multi‑year DCF using free cash flows and constructed/tested a discount rate (WACC) with sensitivity analysis and numeric WACC checks, and cross‑validated against comps; this shows a thorough, applicable understanding of introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five-year explicit forecast from a perpetuity terminal and models base/upside/downside scenarios with faster short‑term growth and more conservative terminal assumptions, plus sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound multi-stage growth approach appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly built a DCF (FCFF) and performed sensitivity analysis with WACC, demonstrating use of WACC as the discount rate. They provided specific WACC-related numbers and a CAPM cross-check (≈8.3%) plus a 10% target/hurdle, showing a defensible and evaluated WACC choice.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models a DCF and FCF bridge, references EBITDA/EBIT and CapEx as drivers, and uses FCF for terminal value—showing conceptual understanding that FCF drives enterprise valuation. However, they do not explicitly list all FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation, and working capital adjustments) or discuss FCF as cash available to all capital providers in clear terms, so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly included a terminal value (perpetuity / FCF-based) and performed validation and sensitivity checks showing awareness that terminal assumptions drive valuation. However, treatment lacks detailed numerical exposition (e.g., explicit TV % of EV or examples showing TV as the majority of value), so the coverage is correct but not fully thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly indicates they performed an EV→equity bridge and ran validation checks, showing conceptual understanding, but they did not show the explicit steps or outputs (subtracting net debt and dividing by shares) in the presented discussion—likely hidden in skipped code. That yields a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.",
