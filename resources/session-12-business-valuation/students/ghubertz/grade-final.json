  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as forecasting future free cash flows and discounting them using WACC, describes a 5-year projection plus terminal value, and applies assumptions (8% growth, 3% terminal g) to produce a DCF EV ($13.44B). This demonstrates a thorough introductory grasp of DCF methodology and its use in valuation and decision-making, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, industry average) and applied both P/E and EV/EBITDA approaches, producing specific derived values (e.g., equity values and a 14.9x implied EV/EBITDA) and comparing them to precedent ranges. The treatment is concrete, uses multiple examples, and integrates these findings into the bid recommendation, meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applied at least two (in fact three) valuation methods, reported numeric results (DCF EV and implied multiple), compared them to trading and precedent multiples, and synthesized a concrete bid range with guidance on which values represent financial-floor versus strategic-ceiling. The DRIVER stages (Discover→Implement→Reflect) show coherent triangulation and reasoned judgment, meeting the standards for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links DCF/FCC valuation to enterprise value and identifies key FCF drivers (EBITDA/EBIT proxy, CapEx, working capital) and uses WACC to discount FCF (implying FCF to the firm). However, they do not explicitly mention NOPAT/EBIT or depreciation/amortization adjustments, so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value approach (five-year forecast plus perpetuity growth, g=3%) and reports a DCF terminal-driven EV, so the calculation is present. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (\"five-year projection\") and a terminal value and uses higher short-term growth (8%) versus a lower long-term g (3%), demonstrating correct multi-stage structure. However, the justification is brief and qualitative (\"aggressive, but justifiable\") without deeper sensitivity analysis or empirical support, so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly developed.",
