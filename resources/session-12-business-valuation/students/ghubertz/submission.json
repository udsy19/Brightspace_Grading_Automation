  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Graham Hubertz. Doing the\nsession, 12 assignment for Management\n310. So our assignment overview, deliver a\nfull valuation of Panera Breadth or a\nprospective KKR takeover using driver.\nCombine DCF, trading comps, and precedent\ntransactions to produce an informed bid\nrange while contrasting financial buyer\ndiscipline with strategic buyer synergies.\nSo our deal snapshot,\nscale $6 billion,\nrevenue growing 8%, $900 million EBITDA\nwith a 15% margin. $400 million net income\nacross 2100 stores. Digital sales are already\n50%. Our market references. Industry P\n&E is about 22 times. President EBITDA\nmultiplies 12 to 15 times. Chipotle trades at\n35 times P slash E. McDonald's is that 25\ntimes capital assumptions our industry is\nwhack is nine percent our management wants\n10 percent rollover strategic bidders\nstarbucks mcdonald's are circling our growth\nlevelers 500 new stores in five years our\ndigital makes the 70 percent our dinner\nslash catering expansion or excuse me our\nearly stage international rollout so they\nwant to create an executive ready recommendation\nthat states your evaluation range\nwinning bid range and rationale for choosing\nfinancial versus strategic positioning.\nSo I put this into Google Gemini\nusing the driver method as well.\nSo here we go,\nArt of Find and Discover, here's our D. The\ngoal is to determine an informed bid range\nfor Panera Bread for a prospective KKR\ntakeover by combining three valuation\nmethodologies, discounted cash flow, trading comps,\nand precedent transactions. The final\nrecommendation must include a winning bid\nstrategy, contrasting financial buyer discipline,\nKKR, with strategic buyer synergies.\nOur key inputs are deal snapshot.\nAs here we go, revenue is $6 billion\ncurrent, and our revenue growth is 8% given.\nABI, TDA, our current is $900,000 it's\ngiven. Our margin is 15% as it's given,\nas it's $900,000 divided by $6 billion.\nNot $900,000, excuse me, $900 million.\nOur net income is $400 million.\nStores are $2,100.\nAnd, excuse me, in the industry, P&E\nis 22 times our market reference, as\nall these are given to us already.\nSo we go into represent.\nSo our analytical plan, our DCF\nvaluation. Our methodology is five-year\nprojection plus terminable value.\nOur intrinsic value is forecast future\nfree cash flow based on growth levels,\nlevers, and discount back using WAC.\nThis is a financial buyer's floor.\nThe rationale I had, it used KISS method,\nwhich is keep it simple and stupid.\nSo our trading comps are P&E\nmultiples, our methodology.\nWe have a relative value. Use market\n-based P&E multiples, industry, Chipotle,\nMcDonald's to derive equity value.\nour precedent transaction is e the slash\nebitda multiples our acquisition value is\nuse historical deal multiples to determine\nan enterprise value this provides a\nstrategic buyer ceiling our bid range and\nstrategy our synthesis is to combine all\nthree values into a range and formulate\nthe kkr bid strategy versus strategic\nbidders so here's our python code structure\nfor implement as we go over into to collab\ni had to give me code and here we are\nenterprise value our trading comparables\nenterprise values epitda times multiple\nour synthesized valuation\nrange i'll go back into gemini\nso to validate our metric is dcf ev and our\nvalue is 13.44 billion dollars the intrinsic\nvalue is high reflecting the eight\npercent initial growth in the long-term\nassumption of g perpetuity equals three percent\nthis requires kkr to execute the growth\nplan effectively our metric we use implied\nEBITDA multiple. Our value is $13.44 billion\nover $900 million, which is 14.9x. This\nimplied multiple is at the very high end of\nthe 12 times 15% precedent range, suggesting\nthe market is not fully pricing and the full\nstrategic growth potential. Our validation\nof DCF is aggressive, but justifiable for\na growth asset sir comps validation our\nindustry average average is 22 times with the 8\n.8 billion dollar derived equity value it sets\na style and solid non -premium equity value\nour chipotle is 35 times with the 14 billion\ndollar derived equity value it represents\na strategic premium for digital growth\nfocus a key reference for strategic bidders our\nmcdonald's is 25 times multiple with a $10\nbillion derived equity value. This represents\na strategic base for a mature cash\ngenerating business. So our E for Evolve, we have\nvaluation synthesis and bid range. The three\nmethodologies establish a clear spread.\nOur floor is our financial buyer. The DCF $13\n.44 billion EV is the maximum KKR can pay\nand still meet their return hurdle. Nine whack\nbased on operational improvements our\ntarget mid-range the low end of precedent\ntransactions 10.8 billion dollar ev is the value\nimplied by typical historical deals our\nceiling is our strategic buyer which is the\nhigh end of precedent transactions 13.5 billion\ndollar ev it is the value for a strategic\nasset with high synergies such as mcdonald's\nand starbucks our final bid range or\nenterprise value, $11.5 billion to $14 billion.\nOur rationale for low -end, $11.5 billion.\nIt's a modest premium to\nthe low-precedent multiple,\n$10.8 billion for KKR's discipline first\nbid. Our rationale for high-end, $14 billion,\na premium above the DCF and\nhigh-precedent multiple,\njustified only if KKR believes they\ncan capture some strategic-like\nvalue slash synergies themselves.\nSo we go into Reflect R. Our executive\nrecommendation to KKR Investment Committee\nform from our valuation team subject,\nour Panera Bread Takeover recommendation,\nour valuation range, our analysis\ncombining intrinsic DCF relative comps\nand acquisition precedent values establishes\na target enterprise value range of\n$11.5 billion to $14 billion. dollars.\nSo our winning bid strategy is financial\nversus strategic positioning. Our valuation\napproach is DCF driven, focusing on\nmaximizing free cash flow by improving\nEBITDA margins, controlling capex, and\noptimizing working capital. Our synergies\ndriven, willing to pay a higher multiple\nbased on identifiable cost savings, supply\nchain GNA, and revenue acceleration,\nco-branding, real estate optimization. Our\nbid positioning, our disciplines start\nwith a low credible bid at 12 billion\ndollars and justify it on black slash return\nhurdle leverage the 400 million dollar net\nincome floor our aggression can justify\n14 billion dollar bid by proving 500 million\ndollars in synergies effectively lowering\nthe actual acquisition cost for them\nso our kkr winning bid\nstrategy the driver rationale\nKKR cannot win a bidding war purely\non price against a strategic buyer\nwho can realize massive synergies.\nKKR's winning strategy must be multifaceted.\nOur opening bid, we submit a firm preemptive\noffer at the mid to high end of the\nlow precedent range at around $12 billion EV.\nOur rationale, this signals seriousness\nand discipline and is well justified by the\n$10.8 billion to the $13.5 billion precedent\nrange. Our value add narrative, we stress\nthe non-price components. Our management\nrollover, we emphasize the support for the\n10% management rollover and KKR's track\nrecord in accelerating digital slash store\ngrowth, 500 new stores and 70% digital mix.\nWe have speed and certainty, offer the\nfastest path to close and highest transaction\ncertainty, appealing to management\nwho seek a clean exit. So our final big cap,\nhold the line at the DCF implied EV $13\n.44 billion round up to $13.5. This is\nthe highest priced KKR can pay while\nmaintaining financial buyer discipline. If a\nstrategic bidder goes above $14 billion,\nKKR should walk away as the price is too\nhigh and only justified by synergy KKR\ncannot capture. So our final recommendation,\nwe bid $12 billion initially\nwith the capacity to stretch your $13.5\nbillion dollar EV, emphasizing KKR's\noperational expertise over sheer financialsize. That's my assignment. Thank you."
