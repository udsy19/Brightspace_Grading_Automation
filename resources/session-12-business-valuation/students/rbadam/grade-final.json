  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes a multi-year projection (years 1–3, transition year, and up to years 8–10), and explains dynamic revenue/margin evolution (J-curve from negative cash flows to steady-state profitability). They also implement and validate these assumptions via a driver-based DCF and sensitivity analysis, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes multiple clear summary visuals (J‑curve cash flow chart, sensitivity heat map, and a football‑field triangulation) and explains their interpretation, meeting the requirement for a simple chart/table summarizing valuation results. The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) provide supporting evidence of intention, execution, and risk‑checking of those visuals.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission explicitly defines key inputs (WACC, terminal growth) and describes varying them across ranges to produce a heatmap, demonstrating the model handles input changes. Triangulation using comps and precedent transactions shows inclusion of market-multiple-based valuation methods, satisfying the parameterized inputs criterion at a thorough, applied level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames DCF as a forward-looking valuation and shows use of WACC (including sensitivity analysis), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly state DCF as the present value of future free cash flows nor show detailed discounting mechanics or formulas, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses building a DCF and shows conceptual cash-flow behavior (J-curve) but never identifies the core Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor states that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital. Given the absence of those specific elements, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal growth assumption and implements sensitivity around it (evidence of a TV calculation in the DCF and heat‑map stress test), but they do not explicitly discuss that Terminal Value typically comprises the majority of enterprise value. Thus the treatment is correct but basic/incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",
