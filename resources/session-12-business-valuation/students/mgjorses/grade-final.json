  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used a 9% industry-weighted WACC in their DCF and ran sensible ±1% sensitivity tests, producing specific enterprise-value outcomes. That demonstrates a defensible WACC choice and clear application as the discounting input, meeting the criterion at a thorough (PASS) level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and cited P/E and EV/EBITDA/precedent multiple ranges, then applied those multiples to produce valuation ranges (floor/ceiling) as part of a comps methodology. Coverage is specific, includes multiple examples and resulting valuation outcomes, meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory comparable-methods treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation using DCF, trading comps, and precedent transactions, presented numeric ranges for each method, and ran sensitivity analyses (WACC/scenario). They also used those results to recommend a bid range and strategy, demonstrating thorough, applied treatment of valuation triangulation and sensitivity.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, practical use of a DCF (ran a modeled DCF, produced enterprise values) and explicitly applies WACC sensitivity, indicating use of a discount rate. However, the submission lacks an explicit, thorough conceptual statement that DCF is the present value of future free cash flows and is otherwise a basic/brief treatment, so it meets the criterion partially but not at the depth required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of DCF and cash-flow-driven valuation (inputs like EBITDA, tax rate, WACC, net debt) and implemented a model, but never explicitly identifies core Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor clearly states that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers. That partial, applied understanding aligns with a PARTIAL score.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value inputs (terminal growth / exit multiple) and implements them in a DCF (Discover + Implement), demonstrating correct use of TV. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF valuation, so treatment is correct but incomplete. Hence PARTIAL.",
