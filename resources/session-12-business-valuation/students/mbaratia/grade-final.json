  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines free cash flow and describes computing FCF, uses WACC to discount projected FCFs and add a terminal value, and demonstrates application across scenarios with sensitivity analysis. This is a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT after tax, D&A, CapEx, change in NWC) and states FCF is \"available to all capital providers.\" They implement the calculation in a 5-year projection and use the resulting FCFs in a DCF valuation, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated a terminal value (Gordon growth) and reported terminal and PV-of-terminal amounts across scenarios, demonstrating application. Their reflection on sensitivity shows awareness that terminal value dominates and drives valuation, meeting the thoroughness needed for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit 5-year forecast and a terminal period (Gordon growth) and provides concrete short-term growth scenarios (downside/base/upside/strategic). However, they do not state or justify a specific, lower long-term/terminal growth rate (only sensitivity discussion), so the multi-stage growth reasoning is correct but incompletely developed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual workflow (knows net debt and reports EV and resulting equity values from the DCF), but does not explicitly show the step of subtracting net debt from EV nor any explicit step dividing equity value by share count to produce a price per share. Thus understanding is present but treatment is incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected appropriate peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and described applying P/E and implied EV/EBITDA multiples to derive equity values, satisfying the criterion conceptually. However the treatment is high-level with limited clear numeric/comparative detail or stepwise application, so it meets basic requirements but not the thoroughness required for a PASS.",
