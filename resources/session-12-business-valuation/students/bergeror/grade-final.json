  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes a multi-year DCF producing free cash flows (adjusted for taxes, capex, working capital) and shows they implemented scenario toggles in a model, satisfying the methodological application. They also identify and analyze the discount rate (WACC) and its inverse effect on valuation, demonstrating a solid conceptual and applied grasp consistent with a PASS at the introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected appropriate peers (McDonald's, Chipotle, industry median) and cited specific multiples (22x, 25x, ~35x, and 12–15x transaction EBITDA) and applied them to Panera to produce an implied range that aligns with the DCF. Implementation (scenario toggles) and reflection (triangulation) show a correct, multi-example application—meeting thorough introductory comparable methodology expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation using DCF, trading comparables, and precedents, ran sensitivity analysis on WACC/terminal assumptions, and produced a recommended enterprise value (~$13B). This shows a solid, multi-method comparison and a reasoned valuation range consistent with the DRIVER implement and reflect stages, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly cites key FCF elements (taxes/NOPAT implication, CapEx, working capital) and uses a DCF implementation to generate FCF, but does not explicitly mention depreciation or clearly state that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital. Evidence shows solid conceptual use but incomplete coverage, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of terminal-value assumptions (terminal growth) and includes them in sensitivity analysis, but does not present an explicit terminal value calculation (growth or exit multiple) nor explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value. This meets a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student distinguishes an explicit forecast period (a five-year plan) and models scenario-driven short-term projections, but they do not present clear, reasonable multi-stage growth assumptions (e.g., specified higher near-term vs lower long-term terminal rates). Their reflected claim that terminal growth \"doesn't really add to it\" shows confusion about terminal period effects, so the treatment is correct in part but incomplete and inconsistent.",
