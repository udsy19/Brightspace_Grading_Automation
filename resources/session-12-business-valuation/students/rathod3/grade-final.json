  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the present value of projected unlevered free cash flows and states that future cash flows are discounted using WACC, then implements numeric WACC and DCF calculations with outputs and sensitivity analysis. This is a thorough, applied treatment consistent with a PASS at the introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies the FCF components with the canonical formula and implements them in code, producing FCF and PV outputs. They also show conceptual understanding that unlevered FCF drives enterprise value and that subtracting net debt yields equity value (i.e., cash available to capital providers), with validation and sensitivity analysis—meeting the thorough standard for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly described both Gordon-growth and exit-multiple terminal value methods, implemented them in a Python model, reported the numeric TV (≈13.9B) and total EV, and checked TV’s share of value (≈75–80%) and sensitivity. This is a thorough, well-supported treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission demonstrates external validation efforts (comps, precedent transactions, technical sanity checks) and discusses limitations, but it does not name specific external sources/tools (e.g., Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, specific databases or websites). Per the category standards, this meets PARTIAL: validation is present and substantive but lacks the specific external-source citations required for a full PASS.",
