  "transcript": "0:01\nSo the first stage for the first stage\n0:04\num is to find discover and before we get\n0:06\ninto that I'm just going to read the\n0:07\nassignment overview. So deliver a full\n0:10\nvaluation of Panera Bread for a\n0:12\nprospective KKR takeover using driver\n0:14\ncombine DCF trading comps and precedent\n0:17\ntransactions to produce an informed bid\n0:19\nrange while contrasting financial buyer\n0:22\ndiscipline with strategic buyer\n0:23\nsynergies.\n0:25\nSo for define and def discover.\n0:28\nSo this stage focuses on establishing\n0:30\nthe scope of the KKR acquisition\n0:32\nanalysis, validating the operational\n0:35\ndata and defining the valuation\n0:37\nmethodologies required to produce a\n0:39\ncompetitive yet disciplined bid. So the\n0:42\nproblem KKR is evaluating a potential\n0:44\nleverage buyout or acquisition of Panera\n0:46\nBread. The target is a mature fast\n0:48\ncasual chain with significant um digital\n0:52\ninfrastructure. So the core challenge is\n0:54\nvaluation triangulation. We must\n0:56\ndetermine a bid price that offers KKR a\n0:59\nsufficient internal rate of return while\n1:01\nremaining competitive against strategic\n1:03\nbuyers who can pay a premium price due\n1:05\nto operating synergies. And we need to\n1:07\nassertain if financial discipline can\n1:09\nwin against strategic synergies. So the\n1:12\nobjective is to utilize a Python\n1:13\nautomated valuation model to produce a\n1:16\ndefensible valuation range. So this will\n1:19\ncombine intrinsic value with relative\n1:21\nvalue to recommend a specific bid price.\n1:23\nThe analysis must explicitly contrast a\n1:27\nfinancial buyer valuation against a\n1:29\nstrategic buyer valuation to determine\n1:31\nthe walkway price. So we just need to\n1:33\nverify all the facts.\n1:36\nSo we got to verify the base here of\n1:38\nearnings before interest, taxes,\n1:40\ndepreciation, and amortization which is\n1:43\n$900 million and revenue is $6 billion.\n1:46\nFor multiples, acknowledge the spread\n1:48\nbetween general peran transactions and\n1:50\nhigh growth peers like Chipotle. We must\n1:52\ndetermine if Panero warrants a Chipotle\n1:54\npremium due to its 50% digital sales mix\n1:57\nor McDonald's discount due to\n1:58\nsaturation. And the analysis must\n2:01\naccount for the 10% management rollover\n2:03\nwhich reduces the upfront cash KKR needs\n2:06\nto dis deploy but impacts the exit\n2:08\nequity stack. So the hypothesis the\n2:11\nstrategic gap so strategic buyers like\n2:14\nStarbucks will likely have a higher\n2:16\nceiling price than KKR because they can\n2:18\nrealize immediate cost synergies and\n2:20\nrevenue synergies. Um the KKR\n2:23\nopportunity. So although KKR can justify\n2:26\na winning bid if the valuation model\n2:28\nprovides that the growth uh levers can\n2:30\nexpand EBITDA margins beyond the current\n2:34\n15%. If the operational improvements\n2:38\ndrive enough cash flow, KKR can leverage\n2:40\nthe asset sufficiently to beat strategic\n2:42\nbiders who might be more conservative on\n2:44\ngrowth. So for the actions, so parame\n2:48\nparameterize\n2:50\nthe Python model. So set up the Python\n2:52\nenvironment to handle dynamic variables\n2:54\nfor weighted average cost of capital,\n2:56\nterminal growth, and active toggles for\n2:58\nthe three key growth levers of store\n3:01\ncount, digital mix, and margin\n3:03\nexpansion. For market calibration,\n3:05\nconfirm the current risk-free rates\n3:09\nand equity risk premiums to build the\n3:11\ncost of equity, but specifically focus\n3:13\non the cost of debt for LBO scenario,\n3:15\nensuring the WACC refers a leveraged\n3:18\ncapital structure. Then for the plan, so\n3:21\nthe final output cannot be simply a\n3:23\nsingular number. It must be a bid\n3:25\nstrategy matrix. So the floor is the\n3:27\nlowest defensible value which is\n3:29\ndownside DCF. The ceiling is the max\n3:31\nprice before IRR dips below required\n3:33\nreturn which is financial buyer\n3:35\nconstraints and strategic zone which is\n3:37\nthe likely price range of Starbucks or\n3:39\nMcDonald's which is synergized valuation\n3:42\nand with the recommendation. So if the\n3:44\nstrategic zone is significantly higher\n3:46\nthan the KKR ceiling, the recommendation\n3:48\nmay be to withdraw or seek a\n3:50\npartnership. And then some key questions\n3:52\nto answer is does Panera does Panera's\n3:55\n50% digital mix justify trading closer\n3:57\nto Chipotle or the broader industry?\n4:00\nWhat is the quantitative value of the\n4:02\nstrategic premium Starbucks buys them\n4:05\nat? And how much do they save in SGNA?\n4:09\nAnd then third question is how does a\n4:10\n10% management rollover affect the KKR's\n4:13\ncash on cash return and alignment of\n4:15\nincentives?\n4:16\nAnd fourth question is is the plan to\n4:19\nopen 500 new stores capital efficient or\n4:22\nwill the capex requirements drag down\n4:24\nfree cash flow in the initial years\n4:26\nhurting the DCF valuation? Then the last\n4:29\nquestion is how does moving the WCC from\n4:31\nthe industry average to a potentially\n4:34\nhigher LBO adjusted rate impact the\n4:36\nterminal value?\n4:38\nthen represent. So this is the plan. So\n4:42\nfirst we have core formula and\n4:44\nmethodology. So the analysis will\n4:46\nleverage a triangulated valuation\n4:48\napproach weighing the intrinsic value\n4:50\nagainst relative market pricing to\n4:52\nestablish a bid range. So in intrinsic\n4:55\nvalue is a discounted cash flow. So we\n4:57\nwill project unlevered free cash flow\n5:00\nover a 5-year forecast period. So the\n5:03\nformula for this is\n5:06\nearnings before interest in taxes times\n5:09\n1 minus tax rate plus depreciation and\n5:12\namortization minus the capital\n5:14\nexpenditures minus change in networking\n5:16\ncapital. And then you have the Gordon\n5:18\ngrowth model which is terminal value\n5:21\nequals to free cash flow time 1 plus\n5:23\ngrowth divided by weighted average cost\n5:25\nof capital minus growth. Then you have\n5:27\nthe exit multiple method. So where your\n5:29\nterminal value equals your terminal year\n5:32\num earnings before interest, taxes,\n5:34\ndepreciation and amortization times the\n5:36\nexit multiple and then you have discount\n5:38\nrate. So future cash flows will be\n5:40\ndiscounted using the weighted average\n5:41\ncost of capital.\n5:43\nThen you have relative valuation which\n5:46\nis multiples analysis. So you have\n5:48\ntrading comp. So apply market premiums\n5:50\nfrom peers to Panera's metrics and then\n5:53\nprecedent transactions. So apply the 12\n5:55\nto 15x EBITDA range from historical\n5:58\ndeals to establish a control premium\n6:00\nbaseline. Then third is the buyer\n6:02\nperspective logic. So financial buyer\n6:04\nKKR um the value equals to the\n6:06\nstandalone DCF minus net debt.\n6:10\nUm and then you have strategic buyer\n6:12\nwhich is syn uh synergize. So value\n6:15\nequals standalone DCF plus present value\n6:18\nof synergies. Um yes. So then you have\n6:22\nyour analytical process. So we'll have a\n6:24\nPython model execute these steps and\n6:27\njust show us all these calculations\n6:29\nbeing done and everything\n6:33\nand then also show us the WACC and rate\n6:35\nof return bid. So calculate the WACC\n6:38\nstarting at the industry standard of 9%\n6:40\nand then create a function to adjust\n6:43\nWACC up to 12% to model the higher cost\n6:45\nof leverage in an LBO scenario or down\n6:48\nto 78% for for strategic buyers with\n6:51\ncheaper capital. Then it'll also do a\n6:54\nforecasting of the free cash flow. So\n6:56\nit'll show us the project revenue, the\n6:58\nproject EBITTA, calculate the tax capex\n7:03\nand etc. Then it'll also show us the\n7:06\nterminal value in discounting and stuff.\n7:08\nAnd it'll also show us the valuation\n7:11\nranges in a table which is like a visual\n7:14\nchart that shows all the valuations and\n7:17\nstuff. And they'll show us strategic\n7:19\nadjustments. So calculate the implied\n7:21\nshare price for KKR, add synergies, um\n7:24\nadjust for net debt and the 10%\n7:25\nmanagement rollover\n7:27\nand all that. So now we move on to the\n7:30\nimplement stage. So I went to Gemini and\n7:33\nI inputed it inputed um a prompt into\n7:38\nGemini asking it to give me a um Python\n7:43\ncode for this problem. Um using very\n7:46\nusing the um\n7:51\num and asked it to put into very easy um\n7:54\nthings for me to understand as well. And\n7:57\nthen I exported to Collab. And so here\n8:01\nit shows the definitions and parameters.\n8:04\nSo the revenue is 6 billion, EBITDA is\n8:09\n72 billion, total debt is 3.5 billion,\n8:12\ncash is.5 billion, shares outstanding is\n8:15\n100 million and current share price is\n8:16\n$95 per share. Then it shows the market\n8:19\ncapital. So current share price times\n8:21\nshares outstanding divided by a,000. And\n8:23\nthen we convert it to billions. Then you\n8:26\nhave your LTM EV. So your LTM market\n8:29\ncapital plus sold debt minus cash. Then\n8:31\nit shows your projection years which is\n8:33\nfive, your tax rate of 21%. Your base\n8:36\nWCC which is 9%, base terminal 2.5%,\n8:40\nrevenue growth um 0.05 in year 1 and\n8:43\nthen revenue growth for years 2 and to\n8:46\nyear five is 0.04 4 and then base margin\n8:50\nfor earnings before interest, taxes,\n8:53\ndepreciation and amortization is 0.125\n8:55\nand then base capex rate is 055\n8:59\nand then base NWC change rate is 0.5\n9:04\nthen you have upside terminal so which\n9:06\nis 003 downside WCC is.1\n9:10\nsynergies um opex is 40 million in\n9:15\noperating expense and synergy and capex\n9:17\nis 10 million.\n9:20\nThen you have some more revenues and\n9:23\nearnings before interest, taxes,\n9:25\ndepreciation and amortization.\n9:27\nUm then it talks about free cash flow,\n9:30\nhow growth equals revenue growth year 1.\n9:34\nUm revenue is current revenue times 1\n9:36\nplus growth. Um\n9:39\ndepreciation and amortization is revenue\n9:42\ntimes 0.05 5 your earnings before\n9:45\ninterest in taxes is EVIT minus\n9:49\ndepreciation in amortization\n9:52\nalso gives us FCF calculation so capex\n9:54\nequals revenue time capex rate NWC\n9:57\nchange equals the revenue minus current\n9:59\nrevenue time NWC rate um it also gives\n10:04\nus the discount factor the present value\n10:06\nof free cash flow um and all that stuff\n10:10\nand it also gives us current revenue\n10:13\nUm it'll also give us terminal free cash\n10:16\nflow, terminal value, present value of\n10:18\nterminal value, total enterprise value.\n10:22\nUm it'll also mention valuation based on\n10:24\nmedian. Um\n10:27\num and then also valuation based on um\n10:33\nrevenue as well and then range of EV\n10:36\nequity value range. um they'll give us a\n10:39\nsynthesized valuation of lower bounds,\n10:41\nupper bounds, what we're looking for um\n10:44\nminimum and maximum equity value,\n10:46\nminimum and maximum share price. Um\n10:51\nthen I'll also look for LTM data for\n10:53\ncomps. So, LTM debt, the cash, the\n10:56\nfinancials, the base WCC base terminal,\n11:00\nbase revenue growth for year 1, base\n11:03\nrevenue growth for years 2 to year 5 um\n11:06\nand many other stuff as well.\n11:10\nThat'll give us upside equity, um,\n11:12\ndownside equity, DCF results, comms\n11:16\nresults, president results, strategic\n11:19\nEV, strategic equity, um, strategic\n11:22\nprice share,\n11:25\num, the synthesized valuation. And so\n11:28\nonce we get that, we run this code.\n11:34\nAnd then once we run it, this is what we\n11:38\nget. So for the analysis so Panera\n11:40\nrevenue is 6 billion LTM EBITDA is 72\n11:45\nbillion median is 2.8x median\n11:49\num is 16x comm's EV range is 11.52\n11:52\nbillion to 16.8 billion comm's equity\n11:55\nrange is 8.52 billion to 13.8 billion\n12:00\nimplied share price is $85 to $138.\n12:05\nThen you have median transaction 3.0x OX\n12:08\nmedian transaction for EBITDA 17.5x\n12:12\nequity range 9.6 to 15 billion implied\n12:16\nshare price is $96 to $150. Then you\n12:19\nhave the projections. So for year one it\n12:21\nsays 6.3 billion revenue. EVITDA is 79\n12:26\nbillion. FCF is.39 billion and PVF FCF\n12:29\nis.36 billion. And it gives us values\n12:32\nfor all of those using the formulas um\n12:35\nfrom years 1 to year 5.\n12:37\nSo strategic buyer valuation.\n12:40\nSo um the strategic EV is 6.22 billion\n12:45\nstrategic equities 3.22 22 billion and\n12:47\nstrategic implied price per share is\n12:49\n32.15.\n12:52\nUm\n12:53\nthen you have valuation ranges. So you\n12:56\nhave methodology, the EV range and the\n12:58\nprice or share range. So for example for\n13:00\nDCF the range is 5.23 to $5.78.\n13:06\nThe price or share range is $23 to $26.\n13:11\nFor comparable companies, EV range is 11\n13:14\nto $16 while price range is $85 to $138.\n13:19\nThen for strategic DCF, EV range is\n13:22\n$6.22\n13:24\nand share range is $32.15.\n13:29\nThen you have synthesized recommended\n13:31\nbid range. So equity value is 2.38\n13:33\nbillion to 15 billion.\n13:35\num\n13:37\nprice per share is $23 to $150\n13:41\nfor recommendation for bid strategy. So\n13:44\ntake the walk away price. So $150 per\n13:47\nshare which is a high end of valuation.\n13:49\nUm that's a recommended bid range. The\n13:52\ninitial bid was $23 per share which is\n13:54\nthe low end of the valuation. Another\n13:57\nthing is to negotiation talking points.\n14:00\nSo upside so emphasize high growth\n14:02\nscenarios um and the value of digital\n14:05\nscale or operating leverage. Downside is\n14:08\nhighlight high debt levels and the risk\n14:10\nassociated with NWC requirements. And\n14:13\nthen the third recommendation is\n14:14\nfinancing considerations. So for\n14:17\nfinancial buyer you must acquire at the\n14:19\nlower end of the range to achieve the\n14:21\ntarget IRR relying heavy heavily on debt\n14:24\nfinancing and cash flow generation.\n14:27\nAnd then you also want strategic buyers.\n14:29\nSo you can justify paying up this uh\n14:32\nsynergy adjusted price by valuing by\n14:35\nvaluing integration benefits. Um and\n14:39\nthen also have integration risk um must\n14:42\nbe managed to capture this premium.\n14:47\nSo that's the implement stage. So just\n14:49\nto recap so financial analysis and\n14:51\ncalculations. So WACC calculations. So\n14:54\ncost of equity it was calculated using\n14:57\nthe CAPM of 4.2%. 2%\n15:00\nplus 1.1 * 5.5 which gives you 10.25.\n15:04\nThen cost of debt you have um 7.5\n15:08\n* 1 - 0025 which gives you 5.63.\n15:13\nUm and then you have DCF valuation. So\n15:16\nyou have your cumulative PV or of FCF\n15:19\nwhich is approximately 4.2 2 billion\n15:21\nterminal value which is approximately\n15:23\n13.9 billion and then total EV which is\n15:27\nbase case of 18.1 billion and then\n15:30\nscenario varian so downside is 15.2 2\n15:32\nbillion if the growth stalls at 2% and\n15:35\nupside is 21.5 billion if digital mix\n15:37\nhits 70% and the margins expand.\n15:41\nThen you have relative valuation market\n15:43\npricing. So we compare the DCF output\n15:45\nagainst the current market multiples to\n15:47\nvalidate the pricing. So trading comps\n15:50\npeers trade at an average of 20.5x EVIDA\n15:54\nimplied value is 1.05 05 billion times\n15:58\n20.5 which gives you $21.5 billion.\n16:03\nThen you have precedented transactions.\n16:05\nSo historical restaurant deals average\n16:08\n14.5x.\n16:09\nSo implied value is 1.05 billion * 14.5\n16:12\nwhich gives you 15.2 billion. Then you\n16:16\nhave the strategic synthesis. So the\n16:17\nanalysis reveals a distinct pricing\n16:19\nhierarchy. So the floor of 15.2 billion\n16:22\nis established by the historical M&A\n16:24\nmultiples. So KKR faces minimal risk\n16:27\nbuying near this level. Then you have\n16:29\nthe fair value of 18.1 billion. So the\n16:32\nDCFbased case this is a maximum rational\n16:34\nbid for the financial buyer without\n16:36\nrelying on hope for execution\n16:38\nperfection. Then you have the strategic\n16:40\nceiling of $22 billion. So this trading\n16:42\ncomps and strategic buyer analysis\n16:44\nsuggests that a competitor could pay up\n16:46\nto 22 billion by factoring in\n16:49\napproximately 3 billion of operational\n16:51\nsynergies that the KKR cannot access.\n16:54\nSo from the Python model we were able to\n16:57\nsee that the current earnings uh before\n16:59\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and\n17:01\namortization was\n17:04\n$1,050 million. Then the implied\n17:07\nmultiple base case was 17.2x\n17:10\nand the bid recommendation is that the\n17:12\nmodel supports an opening bid of 17.5\n17:14\nbillion which aligns with the intrinsic\n17:15\nvalue while leaving room to negotiate up\n17:17\nto 18.1 billion which is the walkway\n17:20\nprice.\n17:21\nThen we have validates just to make sure\n17:23\neverything makes sense and is accurate.\n17:26\nSo the strategic buyer valuation must be\n17:29\nhigher than the financial buyer\n17:30\nvaluation.\n17:32\nAnd the result of this was that it was\n17:34\naccurate as the model calculates the\n17:36\ncontrol premium driven by the synergies\n17:38\nconfirming that the strategic builder\n17:40\nhas a higher ceiling price than KKR.\n17:44\nThen you want to look at uh WCC\n17:46\nsensitivity. So the sensitivity analysis\n17:49\nmatrix shows that as WCC increases\n17:52\nenterprise value decreases and the\n17:54\nPython model also showed that this was\n17:57\naccurate as the inverse relationship\n17:59\nholds true. So a weighted average cost\n18:01\nof capital shift from 9% to 10%\n18:04\nsignificantly compresses the valuation\n18:06\nhighlighting the risk of risk rising\n18:08\ninterest rates on the KKR's leverage\n18:11\nbid.\n18:12\nThen you have external benchmarking so\n18:14\ntrading comps. So the code uses an\n18:16\naverage EBITDA appears approximately 20\n18:20\nto 22x the precedented transaction. So\n18:23\nthe code uses historical deals. So 14 to\n18:26\n23x and then the DCF implied multiple.\n18:29\nSo we want to check if the base case DCF\n18:33\nresults in a EV of approximately 18\n18:36\nbillion on a 1.05 billion EBIT TDA. So\n18:40\nthe implied multiple is 17.1x\n18:42\nand validation just to make sure it\n18:44\nlooks um true. So this falls exactly\n18:48\nbetween the precedent transaction floor\n18:50\nof 14x and the chipotle high growth\n18:52\nceiling of 25x. So this valuation is\n18:54\ncorrect. Then you have technical\n18:56\nverification.\n18:58\nSo terminal value weight. So this model\n19:00\ncalculates TV um terminal value using\n19:02\nthe Gordon growth model method. So we\n19:05\nwant to check to make sure that the\n19:07\nterminal value does not exceed the 75 to\n19:09\n80% of the total enterprise value. So if\n19:12\nit does the valuation is too sensitive\n19:14\nto the perpetu perpetuity assumption. So\n19:19\num we want to review the output in the\n19:21\nDCF dictionary.\n19:24\nThen you have evolve. So this stage\n19:27\nidentifies the limitations of the\n19:28\ncurrent Python model and suggest how to\n19:30\nmake it more dynamic for a real world\n19:32\ninvestment committee. So you have the\n19:35\nstatic capital structure. So\n19:38\nthe current um WACC method uses a fixed\n19:42\ndebt to capital ratio and a static cost\n19:45\nof debt. And so evolution is that in a\n19:48\nreal leverage buyout, debt would spike\n19:50\nto 60 to 70% of capital at the moment of\n19:52\npurchase and then pay down over time and\n19:56\nthe risk of the equity would also spike.\n19:58\nAnd in order to fix this, we should\n20:00\nimplement a circular reference loop to\n20:02\nadjust the ACC annually as that is paid\n20:05\nor switched to an APV um which is\n20:07\nadjusted present value method to value\n20:10\nthe tax shield separately from\n20:11\noperations.\n20:13\nThen you have a digital mix proxy. So\n20:15\nthe limitation of this is that the model\n20:19\num currently aggregates growth into a\n20:21\nsingle revenue growth variable of 6 to\n20:23\n10% and it does not really model the\n20:25\nunit economics of digital versus\n20:27\ninstore. Um and then the evolution is\n20:30\nthat the upside case relies on digital\n20:33\nsales reaching 70%. Um and digital\n20:36\norders typically have higher margins\n20:37\nwhich means that there's lower labor. So\n20:40\nin order to fix it, split the revenue\n20:42\nline into digital revenue and instant\n20:44\nrevenue with like distinct margin\n20:46\nprofiles to validate if the 18% EBIT TDA\n20:49\nmargin target in the upside scenario is\n20:52\nactually achievable.\n20:54\nThen you have the exit multiple\n20:56\nsensitivity. So the limitation is that\n20:58\nthe model relies heavily on the Gordon\n21:00\ngrowth for terminal value and the\n21:03\nevolution is that financial buyers often\n21:05\nexit via sale to another firm. And to\n21:09\nfix this like um calculate terminal\n21:12\nvalue based solely on an exit multiple\n21:16\nlike selling um at 15x EBITDA in year\n21:20\nfive to see if the IRR holds up without\n21:23\nassuming perpetual growth. The last\n21:26\nthing is reflect. So key takeaways and\n21:29\nrecommendations.\n21:31\nSo here is kind of a bid strategy\n21:34\nmatrix. So for the floor price, the\n21:37\nrange was around 15 billion. So based on\n21:39\nthe downside DCF and lower end precedent\n21:42\ntransactions, KKR should not lose the\n21:44\ndeal below this price. And for fair\n21:47\nvalue, the range was 18 billion. So the\n21:49\nbase KCF, this is a disciplined price\n21:51\nwhere KKR achieves its required return.\n21:54\nSo that's a good price to have and a\n21:56\nstrategic ceiling of 22 billion. So this\n21:58\nprice Starbucks or McDonald's can pay\n22:01\ndue to the 4 billion in capitaliz\n22:04\nsynergies identified in the strategic\n22:05\nbuyer analysis. So the first takeaway is\n22:09\ndiscipline versus synergy. So this\n22:11\nanalysis proves that the KKR cannot win\n22:14\na bidding war on price alone. And if a\n22:17\nstrategic buyer is aggressive like\n22:18\nStarbucks, their synergy adjusted\n22:20\nvaluation of $22 billion exceeds KKR's\n22:24\nstandalone valuation of 18 billion by a\n22:26\nlot. So KKR should only proceed if the\n22:29\nstrategic buyers are distracted or\n22:31\nregulatory hurdles prevent them from\n22:33\nbidding. The second takeaway is the\n22:36\ndigital upside is mandatory. So the\n22:38\ndifference between the base and the\n22:40\nupside scenarios in the Python model is\n22:42\nhuge and the 10% growth rate creates\n22:45\nnearly a $3 billion in additional value.\n22:49\nSo the recommendation is that KKR's\n22:51\ninvestment thesis must be entirely\n22:53\npredicted on operational execution\n22:56\nspecifically forcing the digital mix to\n22:58\n70% and optimizing the new store floor.\n23:01\nAnd the third takeaway is management\n23:03\nrollover. So the 10% management rollover\n23:06\nis important and it reduces KKR's\n23:09\nupfront check size which boosts the IRRa\n23:12\nbut more importantly it aligns\n23:14\nmanagement to hit the aggressive upside\n23:15\ngrowth targets required to make the deal\n23:18\nwork. So the final recommendation we\n23:20\nhave is to submit an initial bid at 17.5\n23:24\nbillion. So this anchors the valuation\n23:27\nnear the base case DCF but also you\n23:30\nshould be prepared to stretch this 17.5\n23:32\nbillion to 19 billion but you should\n23:35\nwalk away if the price exceeds 20\n23:37\nbillion as um this enroaches on the\n23:40\nstrategic zone where financial returns\n23:42\nfor KQR will slowly deteriorate below\n23:44\nacceptable risk adjusted levels.\n23:47Thank you."
