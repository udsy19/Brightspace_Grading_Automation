  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF in terms of discounting future unlevered free cash flows and repeatedly references calculating and using WACC, plus implements multiple terminal value methods and scenario/sensitivity analysis. These show a thorough, applied introductory treatment meeting the PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both described and implemented terminal value calculation using the Gordon growth and multiple methods and explicitly noted TV is a significant component of enterprise value. The code implementation and sensitivity/multi-scenario DCF work (Implement + Reflect stages) demonstrate applied understanding beyond a brief mention, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly distinguishes an explicit projection period and terminal value and implements both Gordon growth and exit-multiple terminal methods. They run multi-year (five-year) projections with scenario-specific, declining revenue growth assumptions (higher near-term rates tapering toward terminal) and perform sensitivity on terminal growth—demonstrating thorough, well-reasoned multi-stage growth treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual use of unlevered free cash flow (UFCF), that UFCFs are discounted to derive enterprise value and thus represent cash available to all capital providers, and explicitly models CapEx and working capital. However, they did not explicitly identify EBIT/NOPAT or depreciation as UFCF components, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly demonstrates conceptual understanding of EV vs. equity value (calculated EV, derived equity values from P/E, and mentions converting between equity and EV). However, they do not explicitly show the mechanical bridge steps required by the criterion — subtracting net debt from EV to arrive at equity value or dividing equity value by share count to get a price per share — so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly calculates and applies WACC to discount FCFF and includes WACC sensitivity (correct conceptual and practical use). However, the student did not present a specific, defensible WACC value or explain its derivation/benchmarking in the transcript, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
