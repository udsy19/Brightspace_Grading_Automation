Today,\n\n2\n00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,180\nwe are doing the\nsession 12 assignment,\n\n3\n00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,720\nBusiness Valuation and\nFinancial Modeling.\n\n4\n00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,320\nSo the objective\nhere is deliver a\n\n5\n00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,220\nfull valuation of\nPanera Bread for a\n\n6\n00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,520\nprospective KKR\ntakeover using driver.\n\n7\n00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,380\nWe want to combine\nDCF, trading comps, and\n\n8\n00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,840\nprecedent transactions\nto produce an informed\n\n9\n00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,100\nbid range while\ncontrasting financial buyer\n\n10\n00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,280\ndiscipline with strategic\nbuyer synergies.\n\n11\n00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:37,580\num so it gives us um\nthese um items and so\n\n12\n00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,360\ni'll go over here i've\nalready ran the code so\n\n13\n00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,420\num so first we want\nto initialize the dcf\n\n14\n00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,710\nmodel class and implement\noperating uh projections\n\n15\n00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,420\nuh we will again\nby defining um the\n\n16\n00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,240\npython class dcf model\num and it's going to\n\n17\n00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,880\nhouse all the logic for\nour discounted cash flow\n\n18\n00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,980\nmodel it'll accept\nvarious parameters and\n\n19\n00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,420\ninputs so that's\nessentially what now we're\n\n20\n00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,820\ndoing here and it's\ngoing to calculate the\n\n21\n00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,320\nfive-year operating\nprojections as well so ran\n\n22\n00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:22,220\nthat then we have\nstep to calculate the\n\n23\n00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:32,220\nUFCF and which we also\ndid here then we'll\n\n24\n00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,340\ncalculate the WAC or the\nweighted average cost\n\n25\n00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,500\ncapital and there's the\ncode for that then we\n\n26\n00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,000\nwant to calculate terminal\nvalue then terminal\n\n27\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,580\nvalue represents the\nvalue of company's\n\n28\n00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,280\nunlevered free cash\nflow or UFCF beyond the\n\n29\n00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,100\nexplicit projection\nperiod it's a significant\n\n30\n00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,540\ncomponent of the total\nenterprise value and\n\n31\n00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,220\nin the DCF analysis\nso we'll implement two\n\n32\n00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,240\ncommon methods for\ncalculating TV so the the\n\n33\n00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840\nGordon growth model\nand this assumes that\n\n34\n00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,600\nthe company's free cash\nflow will grow at a\n\n35\n00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,240\nconstant rate in perpetuity\nafter the projection\n\n36\n00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,220\nperiod it's Calculated\nusing the projected\n\n37\n00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,310\nUFCF, their perpetual\ngrowth rate in the\n\n38\n00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,680\nWACC. Then you've got\nthe XM multiple model.\n\n39\n00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,740\nThis method estimates\nthe terminal value\n\n40\n00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,010\nby applying a multiple\nto a financial\n\n41\n00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,180\nmetric in the last\nyear of the projection\n\n42\n00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,400\nperiod. This is\nsupposed to be often\n\n43\n00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,900\nused when comparable\ntransactions or\n\n44\n00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,580\ncompanies trading\nobservable multiples.\n\n45\n00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,460\nAnd so we run that code.\n\n46\n00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,180\nWe also want to\ncalculate your\n\n47\n00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,860\nenterprise value\nor your EV.\n\n48\n00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,720\nSo after projecting\nyour UFCF and TV,\n\n49\n00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,960\nnext we want to\ncalculate the EV.\n\n50\n00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,620\nAnd that represents\nthe total value of\n\n51\n00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,840\na company, including\nboth debt and equity\n\n52\n00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,900\navailable to all\ncapital providers.\n\n53\n00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,250\nIt is calculated\nby discounting\n\n54\n00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,560\nall future UFCFs\nback to the\n\n55\n00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,900\npresent day\nusing the WACC.\n\n56\n00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,820\nand so we did that\nand then step six we\n\n57\n00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,920\nwant to define and\nrun multi scenario DCF\n\n58\n00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640\nanalysis so to provide\nthe comprehensive\n\n59\n00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,040\nevaluation we ran the\nDCF model under three\n\n60\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,260\ndistinct scenarios\nbase case upside down\n\n61\n00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,920\ncase and downside\ncase each scenario\n\n62\n00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,520\nwill have a different\ninput parameter\n\n63\n00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,240\naffecting revenue growth\nrates, margins, etc.\n\n64\n00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,960\nSo incorporating\ngrowth levers.\n\n65\n00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,860\nThe growth levers\nidentified 500 new\n\n66\n00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,060\nstores that will mix\n70% will be translated\n\n67\n00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,720\ninto a specific\nassumption for each\n\n68\n00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,940\nscenario. So revenue\ngrowth rates, the\n\n69\n00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,600\nupside down case\nwill assume more\n\n70\n00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,220\naggressive revenue\ngrowth reflecting\n\n71\n00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,240\nsuccessful execution\nof new store openings,\n\n72\n00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,880\ndigital initiatives,\nand market expansions\n\n73\n00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,460\nthe base case will\nhave moderate growth\n\n74\n00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,880\nand downside i will\nreflect the slower\n\n75\n00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640\ngrowth due to challenges\nin implementing\n\n76\n00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,680\nthese levers and adverse\nmarket conditions\n\n77\n00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,360\noperating margins uh\nso cost of goods sold\n\n78\n00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,330\nand s sgna a digital\nmix and procurement\n\n79\n00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,780\nsynergies from new\nstores i could lead to\n\n80\n00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,320\nmargin improvements\nin the upside case\n\n81\n00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,520\nconversely increased\nmarket spend for new\n\n82\n00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,220\ninitiatives or\noperational inefficiencies\n\n83\n00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,560\nmight impact margin\nin the downside case.\n\n84\n00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,200\nCAPEX, new store\nopenings and\n\n85\n00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,260\ninternational rollout\nwill likely require\n\n86\n00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,160\nhigher CAPEX,\nespecially in the upside\n\n87\n00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,900\ncase to fund\nexpansion.
