  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present value of expected future free cash flows, details UFCF components (NOPAT, D&A, ΔNWC, CapEx), and implements a DCF with an explicit discount rate (WACC = 9%) plus scenario sensitivities. Implementation and reflection stages show applied understanding and interpretation, meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and explains all FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation/amortization add-back, CapEx subtraction, change in working capital) and implements them in a DCF calculation. They also link unlevered free cash flow to enterprise valuation (assume no debt), demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and calculates terminal value (uses terminal growth rates for base/upside/downside), implements it in their DCF code, and reports the PV of the terminal value (~$4.9B) versus PV of projected FCF (~$1.5B), demonstrating that TV comprises the majority of value. Their sensitivity discussion further shows understanding of TV's dominant impact, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes enterprise value (e.g., 6.451 billion) and discusses equity valuation via P/E, but there is no explicit subtraction of net debt (Debt − Cash) from EV nor any division of resulting equity value by share count to produce a price per share. Therefore the required EV→Equity→Price‑per‑share bridge is missing.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed validation by comparing results across methods and running sensitivity analysis (VALIDATE), demonstrating external-market-aware checks via precedent and comps (REPRESENT). However they did not name specific external sources/tools or cite concrete external references, so under the category standards this meets partial rather than full PASS.",
