  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF using unlevered free cash flows and explicitly describes discounting and terminal value mechanics, while programmatically deriving and applying a WACC (with CAPM/beta) as the discount rate. The explanation, numeric outputs, and validation checks show a thorough, applied introductory-level understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates a terminal value using a 3% growth assumption and reports PV figures (terminal PV = 9.56B vs. PV of forecast cash flows = 2.19B), and also acknowledges that the terminal year represents ~70% of value. They further validate and stress-test the TV via sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough understanding and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year forecast with an 8% revenue growth assumption from a terminal value using a 3% growth (and checks terminal weight ≈70%), and runs sensitivity on terminal growth — demonstrating both distinction of periods and reasonable short- vs long-term growth assumptions. The use of implemented code, validation checks, and scenario analysis shows depth beyond a basic mention.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding that unlevered FCF isolates operating cash available irrespective of capital structure and that they adjusted for taxes, CapEx, and working capital. However, they did not explicitly identify all FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT and depreciation are not clearly stated; EBITDA is used), so coverage is correct but incomplete, earning PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding of enterprise value and reports intrinsic/EV figures (Implement + Validate stages) but does not show subtracting net debt or dividing by shares to derive equity value or price per share. Thus the treatment is correct conceptually but incomplete, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly uses peer EV/EBITDA multiples and reports an implied multiple (~15.5x), and presents a valuation range including strategic upside, showing conceptual correctness and a range based on peers. However, the submission lacks explicit, step-by-step application of the peer multiple band to Panera's metric (e.g., showing metric * each peer multiple to produce a peer-implied value range), so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",
