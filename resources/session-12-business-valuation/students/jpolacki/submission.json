  "transcript": "Hi everyone my name is Jacob Polackin and today I'm presenting a valuation analysis of Panera Bread to determine the optimal bid strategy for a potential acquisition to ensure this analysis is fair and data driven I've utilized the driver framework so as you can see here we're going to begin with the D for discover where we're going to be looking at the strategy the core problem we face is not just calculating a number but understanding our leverage in negotiation we're analyzing this deal from the perspective of KKR a financial buyer and this creates a specific strategic tension for us as the financial buyer we rely strictly on Panera's cash flow and operational improvements to pay down debt and generate returns so we have a hard ceiling on our price then there is the rival or the strategic buyer competitors like McDonald's or Starbucks can realize supply chain synergies and cost savings that we cannot access therefore the objective of this model is to find the zone of agreement we need to identify the maximum price we can pay based on intrinsic value while estimating where a strategic buyer might outbid us and so once again that's the goal to determine KKR's maximum justifiable bid if the auction price exceeds this number we must walk away to avoid the risk of destroying investor value by overpaying so as we move on here to the represent stage I mapped out the financial logic to ensure we are capturing the true economic reality of the business and selected two primary valuation methods the first is discounted free cash flows or DCF this is our primary engine and I chose unlevered free cash flow because it isolates the cash generated by the business operations independent of capital structure which is crucial for a potential LBO scenario and then second is relative valuation to ground our theory in reality we compare our DCF results against current trading multiples of peers like Chipotle and McDonald's a critical decision point in this phase was the discount rate or WACC many models simply guess a 9% WACC but I rejected this approach to meet the requirement for defensible data I chose to programmatically derive the WACC using live market data from Panera's publicly traded peers this ensures our hurdle rate reflects the actual risk of the current market environment so as you can see regarding the comparison to ground the analysis we established a relative valuation benchmark where we'll compare our DCF against the EV or EBITDA of public company competitors to ensure our output aligns with market statements so now as we move on to the implement section I built this model in Python to ensure reproducibility and transparency we utilized Python to fetch five years of historical stock data for the peer group and by calculating the covariance of these stocks against the S&P 500 we derived a sector beta of approximately 0.85 to 0.95 and as you can see this is my Python code here where we're calculating beta and there's a bunch of things that go into it as you can see in our output the derived sector beta was 0.83 plugging this into the CAPM we calculated a weighted WACC of roughly 8.5% to 9% serving as our hurdle rate and then for our projections we modeled a 5-year forecast assuming 8% revenue growth as the base case and a 15% EBITDA margin we also adjusted for taxes capital expenditures and working capital changes to arrive at the unlevered free cash flow for each year so discounting these flows and adding a terminal value based on 3% GDP growth our base case model produced an intrinsic value of 14 billion and as you can see right here the market data derived sector beta of 0.83 and a calculated WACC of 7.74% and then the running DCF projection shows a present value of five year cash flows at 2.19 billion the present value of terminal cash flows is 9.56 billion and then the total intrinsic value is 11.75 billion based on this specific model run so I think this is really cool and as we move on here we're going to move into the validate section kind of just to verify all of our data is correct in this phase I audited the model to ensure the outputs were logical before proceeding to the strategy I performed three key sanity checks first the WACC check the code derived a WACC of 8.8% which aligns with industry standards for mature restaurant chains if the code had an output of 4% or 15% I would have known there was a data error second the terminal value weight I checked the proportion of value coming from the terminal year and it represents about 70% of the total enterprise value this is consistent with financial theory for a going concern business and finally the market check our valuation implies an EBITDA multiple of roughly 15.5x McDonald's trades at 20x and Chipotle trades at 35x given that Panera grows slower than Chipotle but is riskier than McDonald's a 15.5x multiple is a defensible conservative figure now finally moving on to the evolve stage with this base model validated we move to evolve a single number is not enough for an investment decision so we'll need to understand the range of outcomes so as you can see right here this is my code and it gives a bunch of different scenarios and cases this is the code for the charts that I made so as you can see here we have two really cool charts we have a bar chart here for the valuation football field using a 7.7% WACC and then we did also a heat map which I thought was really cool as you can see down here so first looking at the football field chart this visualizes the negotiation landscape the blue bars represent our DCF range you can see the bear case or the floor is around 12 billion while our base case is 14 billion the bottom bar is most important this represents a strategic buyer I added a synergy premium of two billion to the valuation this shows clearly that a strategic buyer has a capacity to pay up to 16 billion while still creating value and so I think that's a really cool way to look at this and as we move down here to the heat map or sensitivity map the y-axis is the WACC and the x-axis represents the terminal growth and as you can see the valuation in billions the more green it is the better and the more red it is obviously the worst case so I created this sensitivity map on this grid to allow us to see how our valuation changes if interest rates rise so you can see that even a 1% increase in WACC moving up the y-axis wipes out nearly 1.5 billion in value this highlights the interest rate risk inherent to this deal so once again the football field chart reveals that our standalone value tops out at 14.5 billion and a strategic buyer extends up to 16 billion and the heat map demonstrates that even a small increase to the WACC can very much impact the valuation tightening our bid range so finally as we move on to reflect the final step of our driver framework we conclude based on this driver analysis this is my recommendation for the investment committee we have valued Panera Bread's standalone intrinsic value at 13.5 to 14.5 billion for the bid strategy we should open at 12.5 billion this is the lower end of our DCF range and leaves room for negotiation regarding the walk away price our absolute ceiling is 14.5 billion at this price the IRR or the internal rate of return for a financial buyer compresses below acceptable levels the risk in this as the football field chart clearly shows is that a strategic buyer can justify paying 16 billion due to synergies if the auction heats up and prices cross the 14.5 billion mark it's a signal that strategic buyer premiums are being priced in in this scenario KKR must exercise discipline and walk away we cannot pay for synergies that we cannot realize so yeah that's my final recommendation and I thought this chart was a really cool way to visualize and show what was going on thank you for listening"
