  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs a multi-scenario DCF using free cash flow and terminal value formulas, projects FCFs, computes and justifies a WACC (~9%), and uses these to produce enterprise value ranges and a bid strategy. This is a thorough, correct introductory treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates and reports a terminal value (~$9.95B), documents the formulae and code used to produce it, and acknowledges that terminal value comprises the majority of enterprise value (65–70%), with justification of growth vs. WACC assumptions. This demonstrates a thorough, well-supported treatment satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit five-year forecast from a terminal period, runs downside/base/upside scenarios, and documents short-term drivers (unit expansion, digital penetration) versus long-term constraints. Terminal growth is specified (2–3%) with a conservative justification (below nominal GDP) and a reasonable WACC-growth spread, demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references core FCF inputs (EBIT, tax rate, CapEx, and net working capital) and demonstrates applied computation via code and projections, and explicitly states that FCF is cash available to investors. However, depreciation (or non-cash adjustments) is not explicitly mentioned, so the treatment is correct but incomplete—warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly produced enterprise value and corresponding \"equity value\" outputs and implemented them in code (IMPLEMENT), but the transcript does not explicitly show the required steps of subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) from EV or dividing equity value by share count to get price per share. Therefore the criterion is correctly addressed but not shown in thorough, explicit detail.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly used comparable multiples and reported low/mid/high ranges for trading comps and precedents, and supplied code/tables implying calculation of implied values. However, the submission does not explicitly show the step \"Implied Value = Metric * Multiple\" or detailed multiple-by-metric math in the transcript, and the treatment lacks deeper, explicit computation examples—so the work demonstrates correct understanding but is not thoroughly documented.",
