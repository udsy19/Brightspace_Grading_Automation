  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly projects free cash flows and discounts them (discounted cash flow) and explicitly uses WACC and a discount-rate sensitivity table to bring future values to present. Multiple terminal methods and scenario/sensitivity analysis show a thorough, applied understanding at the introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly lists and computes EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, capex, and changes in working capital to produce free cash flow and uses those cash flows to derive enterprise value then back out net debt to equity value, demonstrating that FCF is treated as cash available to all providers of capital. The depth and application in the DCF model meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements both growth (perpetuity) and multiple (exit-multiple) terminal value methods and reports EV results for each, satisfying the calculation requirement. Their WACC/terminal-growth sensitivity table and the presented five-year FCF magnitude (small relative to multi-billion EV) demonstrate awareness that terminal value materially drives overall valuation, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes performing the EV → Equity bridge (backing out net debt) and computing price per share, and presents EV results and scenario tables. However, the treatment is high-level and lacks detailed numeric demonstration of the net-debt subtraction and the per-share division (no explicit net debt figure or share count shown), so the response is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the valuation object (Panera) and the acquisition context (KKR) and identifies KKR/financial vs. strategic buyers, meeting part of the criterion. However, the submission does not explicitly identify Management as a stakeholder (required under the strict standard), so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external sanity checks (sensitivity table, trading comps, precedent transactions, and peer multiples), showing awareness of validation. However, they did not cite specific external data sources/tools or reference where the precedent multiples came from, so validation is present but not documented to the level required for a full PASS.",
