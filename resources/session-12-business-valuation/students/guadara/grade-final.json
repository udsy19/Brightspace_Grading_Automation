  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines unlevered free cash flow, constructs projected UFCFs, computes present value of those flows plus terminal value, and uses a stated WACC (9%) to discount them. They implemented the methodology in a modeled workflow and performed sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a passing introductory DCF treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (5 years at 8% revenue growth, margin expansion) from the terminal period (3% terminal growth) and uses both perpetuity and exit-multiple terminal methods. Assumptions are reasonable and defended with sensitivity analysis and operational growth levers, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC = 9% as the discount rate in their DCF and terminal value calculations and is clearly drawing that defensible value from the assignment snapshot, then implements it in modelling and sensitivity checks (Discover + Implement + Reflect). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies NOPAT, depreciation/amortization, and CapEx and states that unlevered FCF is cash before debt payments (i.e., available to capital providers), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, working capital changes are not clearly included and the presented formula/wording is somewhat imprecise, so the treatment is correct but incomplete rather than the thorough, detailed coverage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations using both the perpetuity growth and exit-multiple approaches and provides numeric examples (Implement). However, they do not explicitly state the general principle that terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF — although their numbers imply a large terminal component. Thus the treatment is correct and applied but not explicitly reflective enough to merit a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes and discusses enterprise value and the equity financing amount but provides no explicit step subtracting Net Debt (or adding cash) to convert EV into Equity Value, nor any division by share count to derive Price Per Share. Under the rubric, the required EV→Equity bridge steps are missing, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
