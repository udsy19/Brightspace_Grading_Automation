  "transcript": "0:00\nSo for session 12 assignment um to start\n0:02\noff the define and discover stages. So\n0:06\nthe goal here is to create a full\n0:08\nvaluation of Panera Bread for\n0:11\nprospective KKR takeover.\n0:14\nUm I need to combine DCF trading comps\n0:18\nand precedent transactions to produce an\n0:20\ninformed bid range while contrasting\n0:23\nfinancial buyer discipline with\n0:26\nstrategic buyer synergies.\n0:28\nSo, the givens for the deal, the scale,\n0:31\nthere's a $900 million EBITA\n0:35\nwith a 15% margin.\n0:38\nUh, there's a $400 million net income\n0:40\nacross 2100 stores and digital sales are\n0:43\nalready 50%.\n0:45\nUh, some market references, the industry\n0:48\nPE ratio is about 22x.\n0:51\nPrecedent EB ITA\n0:55\nsorry EBIT TDA\n0:58\nuh multiples 12 to 15X Chipotle trades\n1:01\nat 35 PE and McDonald's at 25\n1:06\nuh capital assumptions the industry\n1:08\nWACCC is 9% management wants 10%\n1:12\nrollover strategic biders which is\n1:14\nStarbucks and McDonald's are circling\n1:17\nand then growth levers 500 new stores in\n1:20\nfive years digital mix to 70%\n1:23\ndinner/catering\n1:25\nexpansion and early stage international\n1:28\nrollout roll out. So I need to create an\n1:31\nexecutive ready recommendation that\n1:32\nstates my valuation range uh winning bid\n1:36\nstrategy and rationale for choosing\n1:38\nfinancial versus strategic positioning.\n1:41\nSo to start out I put in all the givens\n1:45\nhere.\n1:47\nUm and then after that I defined the\n1:51\nproject period which is 5 years.\n1:56\nUm, and then I calculated the\n2:00\namount of new stores\n2:03\nand\n2:06\nthe\n2:07\nuh the number of new stores and I\n2:09\ncalculated the initial revenues and the\n2:11\ncurrent revenue which is EBIT TDA\n2:16\ndivided by EBT EBIT TDA margin.\n2:21\nUm, and that came out to this plan here,\n2:23\nwhich is the five-year operating\n2:26\nprojection. So, year 1, year two, year\n2:28\nthree, year four, year five, and then\n2:30\ntheir operating costs, which go up over\n2:32\ntime, as well as their EBIT\n2:35\nTDA,\n2:37\nand their number of stores. I'm assuming\n2:39\nthey go up 100 per year.\n2:42\nUm, and then after that, I had to\n2:45\nconvert relevant columns. There's a lot\n2:49\nof\n2:50\num there's a lot of code here that I had\n2:53\nto run through. I had to define I had to\n2:56\ndefine the additional DCF assumptions\n2:58\nusing tax rate.\n3:01\nUm I calculated the DNA, the EB it\n3:05\ntaxes, the NOAT cap X change in um NWC\n3:11\nand the UFCF. So after running all of\n3:14\nthat\n3:16\num it came out to all of these numbers\n3:18\nwhich I will not read for time sake. Um\n3:22\nhowever\n3:23\nessentially what's what's good to know\n3:25\nis over time everything goes up.\n3:28\nUm\n3:31\nand then after that I had to calculate\n3:33\nthe discount factors uh the present\n3:35\nvalue of the UFC uh terminal value.\n3:39\nSo those come out to here. Total present\n3:42\nvalue uh about 2.8 billion. Terminal\n3:47\nvalue about 12.6 billion. Present value\n3:50\nof the terminal value is about 8.2. And\n3:53\nthen the enterprise value which is the\n3:55\nbase case is 11 billion.\n3:58\nUm after that\n4:02\nthis is the um five-year operating\n4:05\nprojections with uh present value of\n4:07\nUFCF\n4:10\nall these numbers here. Um following\n4:13\nthat I have to update my\n4:15\num I had to define my assumptions for\n4:18\nthe upside and the downside scenarios.\n4:21\nUm\n4:23\nand then following that I had to extract\n4:25\nthe assumptions and then put them into\n4:27\nlists.\n4:29\nUm, and that's a lot of code there, but\n4:32\nit's basically the DCF calculation\n4:33\nfunction. Calculate DCF is defined\n4:36\nthrough all this. And then I had to um\n4:41\ncalculate I had to call the calculate\n4:44\nDCF uh for upside and downside\n4:48\nwhich the enterprise value for the\n4:49\nupside case is about 17.1 billion and\n4:54\nfor the downside is about 4.4 billion.\n4:59\nUm and then following that I had to\n5:01\ncalculate Panera's equity value. Um\n5:07\nbased on PE\n5:09\nand define a reasonable range\n5:13\nuh calculate Panera's enterprise value\n5:16\nbased on the EB ITDA\n5:20\nand then running all this I got these\n5:22\nnumbers. So the equity value for the\n5:26\nindustry Chipotle and McDonald's PE is\n5:29\n8.8 14 and 10 billion. Uh the enterprise\n5:33\nvalue trading EB ITDA\n5:37\nlow and high is 7.2 and 9 billion\n5:40\nrespectively. And the equity value range\n5:43\nfor the P multiples 8.8 billion. And the\n5:46\nenterprise value range which is the\n5:48\ntrading EV over EB ITDA multiples is um\n5:55\n7.2 - 9 billion.\n5:59\nSo after that I had to calculate the\n6:01\nenterprise value based on\n6:04\nthe low and high\n6:07\num estimates\n6:09\nor low and high uh precedent EBIT TDA\n6:12\nmultiple and doing that I get uh 10.8\n6:17\nbillion and 13.5 billion and then the\n6:19\nvalue range\n6:21\nuh the precedent transaction value range\n6:23\nis between 10.8 8 and 13.5 billion. Um\n6:27\nand then I have to define the best case\n6:28\nassumptions\n6:31\nuh use and applying uh synergy boosts\n6:35\nuh to create a strategic buyer\n6:38\nassumption.\n6:39\nUm and then basically what this is is\n6:41\nthe enterprise value for the strategic\n6:43\nbuyer case with synergies is 13.441 441\n6:48\nbillion and the strategic buyer\n6:51\nassumptions and enterprise value\n6:52\ncalculated incorporating\n6:55\nuh synergies. Following that I had to\n6:58\ndefine uh an example synergy percentage\n7:02\nand then best case\n7:04\nuh so the monetary value of revenue\n7:06\nsynergy in year 1 is 72 million and then\n7:09\nthe monetary value of synergy of cost\n7:11\nsynergy in year 1 is 120 million. the\n7:14\nenterprise\n7:16\nuh and as stated before the enterprise\n7:18\nvalue uh buyer strategic buyer case with\n7:21\nsynergies is 13.441\n7:24\nbillion\n7:26\nfollowing that I had to collect the\n7:28\nenterprise values from the DCF scenario\n7:32\num and other other scenarios here\n7:37\nso the DCF the downside is 4.4 4\n7:41\nbillion. Um the best case is 11 billion\n7:44\nand then the strategic buyer synergies\n7:46\nis 13.441 billion and the upside is uh\n7:50\n17.133\n7:52\nbillion. Um\n7:56\nand trading comps and precedent\n7:58\ntransactions are as follows with the low\n8:00\nbeing 72, the high being nine, the low\n8:04\nbeing 10.8 and the high being 13.5.\n8:07\nAfter that I had to uh create a football\n8:11\nfield chart which is shown\n8:14\nright here\n8:17\nand basically that looks like this.\n8:22\nSo let me open that up real quick. So\n8:24\nthis is the Panera bread valuation, the\n8:26\nfootball field analysis,\n8:29\nuh which shows the DCF upside, the\n8:31\nstrategic buyer best case, the range for\n8:35\nprecedent transactions, the range for\n8:38\ntrading comps and the DCF downside. So\n8:41\nand this goes by the enterprise value on\n8:44\nthe Xaxis.\n8:47\nSo uh now to recommend a bid strategy\n8:50\nusing walkway price uh negotiation\n8:53\ntalking points and financial\n8:55\nconsiderations. So I say a realistic and\n8:59\ndefensible bid range for Panera Bread\n9:01\nwould be between 10 and a half and 12\n9:03\nbillion.\n9:04\nUm, this range sits comfortably above\n9:07\nthe trading comps valuation and aligns\n9:10\nwell with the lower to mid-range of\n9:13\nprecedent transactions and encompasses\n9:16\nthe DCF best case making it attractive\n9:19\nfor both financial and strategic buyers\n9:22\nwhile reflecting Panera's intrinsic\n9:24\nvalue and potential. So the rationale\n9:27\nfor that is for a financial buyer\n9:30\num a bit in the lower end of this range\n9:32\n10 and a half to 11 billion would appeal\n9:34\nto financial buyers offering a\n9:36\nreasonable control premium over public\n9:39\nmarket comparables while also allowing\n9:44\nuh for attractive returns through\n9:46\noperational improvements and financial\n9:48\nstructuring. uh the DCF best case of 11\n9:52\nbillion serves as a strong anchor for\n9:54\ntheir perspective. And then from the\n9:56\nstrategic buyer's perspective,\n9:58\na strategic buyer anticipating\n10:00\nsignificant synergies could justify a\n10:02\nbid towards the higher end of this range\n10:04\nbetween 11.5 and 12 billion uh which\n10:07\naligns with the lower end of the\n10:09\nprecedent transaction multiples\n10:12\num and captures a portion of the value\n10:14\ncreated by potential synergies. Uh while\n10:17\ntheir internal valuation for the DCF\n10:20\nstrategic buyer might go higher 13.44\n10:23\nbillion as previously discussed\n10:27\nuh they would aim to acquire Panera at a\n10:29\nprice that still leaves substantial\n10:31\nsynergy value for themselves.\n10:34\nUm now for the walkway price the\n10:36\nabsolute walkway price for Panera Bread\n10:38\nshould be 9 and a half billion.\n10:42\num\n10:43\nensuring that any deal significantly\n10:46\nsurpasses the public market valuation\n10:48\nwithout a control premium. uh this\n10:51\nrecognition that the company's\n10:54\nstandalone DCF best case is considerably\n10:58\nhigher 11 billion providing a strong\n11:00\nintrinsic value baseline a slight\n11:03\npremium over the trading comps to\n11:04\naccount for the control premium typical\n11:07\nin an acquisition even for a financial\n11:10\nbuyer focused on operational efficiency.\n11:15\nUm some negotiation talking points for\n11:18\nPanera Bread would be growth levers and\n11:20\ndigital transformation shifting to the\n11:23\n70%\n11:24\ndigital\n11:26\num uh which would emphasize the success\n11:30\nof recent growth initiatives, new\n11:33\nstores, dinner catering expansion, early\n11:36\nstage international rollout.\n11:40\nUh a strong brand equity and consumer\n11:42\nloyalty highlight Panera's uh\n11:45\nestablished brand uh loyal customer base\n11:48\nand premium positioning in the fast\n11:51\ncasual segment. Um this justifies a\n11:54\nhigher multiple compared to the general\n11:57\nindustry averages.\n11:59\nUm operational efficiency and margin\n12:01\nexpansion.\n12:03\nUm they could discuss ongoing efforts\n12:05\nand future potential uh for cost of\n12:08\ngoods sold and operating expense\n12:10\nimprovements\n12:12\nsuch as supply chain optimization and\n12:14\nlabor management.\n12:17\nuh quantifiable synergies for strategic\n12:20\nbuyers would be the present detailed\n12:22\nmodels of the potential revenue and cost\n12:24\nsynergies for example cross-selling\n12:26\nopportunities procurement savings GNA\n12:29\nrationalization\n12:31\nuh leverage the the strategic buyers DCF\n12:34\nto demonstrate the substantial value\n12:36\nthese synergies unlock justifying a\n12:39\nhigher bid from them uh and then\n12:41\nmanagement rollover for financial buyers\n12:43\nuh you could reiterate the management\n12:45\nteam's commitment and willingness uh for\n12:48\na 10% rollover signaling uh alignment of\n12:51\ninterest and confidence in future\n12:53\nperformance which derisks the investment\n12:56\nfor financial buyers\n12:59\nand then uh limited integration risk for\n13:01\nstrategic buyers uh will um\n13:05\nwellnowledging\n13:07\nintegration challenges\n13:09\nuh emphasize the compatibility of\n13:12\nPanera's operations uh with the\n13:14\npotential strategic partners ers\n13:17\nfocusing on technology problems, supply\n13:19\nchain fit and cultural alignment.\n13:22\nUm and then the financing considerations\n13:25\nis the management rollover of 10%.\n13:28\nUm debt financing\n13:31\nuh equity contribution\n13:34\ncontrol premiums\n13:36\nsynergy realization\n13:38\nand an exit strategy. So for financial\n13:41\nbuyers the financial structure will be\n13:43\ninfluenced by the anticipated exit\n13:45\nstrategy. for example, an IPO\n13:48\num sale to another strategic buyer\n13:51\nwithin a 3 to sevenyear time frame.\n13:54\nPanera's growth potential and market\n13:56\nposition provide multiple attractive\n13:57\nexit avenues.\n14:00\nUm and then after that I had to run a\n14:02\nsensitivity analysis.\n14:05\nUm and then I had to define the ranges\n14:09\nuh for each key driver. So I went the\n14:12\nWACCC from 8 to 10%. Terminal growth 1.5\n14:16\nrevenue synergy from uh\n14:20\nrevenue synergies from 0.5 to 0.19\n14:26\num and cost synergies from 1 to 3%.\n14:30\nSo after running all this the uh perform\n14:33\nsensitivity analysis for each driver\n14:36\nvisualizing the results and plotting it\n14:39\nit came up with this which shows a\n14:43\nsensitivity analysis\n14:46\num sorry it's shaking a lot sensitivity\n14:49\nanalysis of key valuation drivers on\n14:53\nenterprise value which shows the WACC\n14:56\nsensitivity on the enterprise enterprise\n14:59\nvalue um based on percentage\n15:02\nbased on the percentage of the WACCC. So\n15:04\nit goes down as percentage goes up.\n15:07\nTerminal growth rate sensitivity goes up\n15:09\nas the enterprise value the terminal\n15:13\ngrowth rate for sensitivity goes up as\n15:15\nthe enterprise value goes up as well as\n15:17\nthe revenue synergy sensitivity and the\n15:20\ncost synergy sensitivity. They both go\n15:22\nup as enterprise value goes up.\n15:30\nSo overall the the key findings for this\n15:33\num is that the over the five-year uh\n15:37\nprojection period Panera is projected to\n15:39\nincrease its storecom from 2100 to 2600.\n15:42\nUh revenue is expected to grow\n15:44\napproximately 6.65 65 billion in year 1\n15:47\nto 6.94 billion in year five with the\n15:50\nEBI TDA increasing from an estimated\n15:55\nalmost a billion in year 1 to 1.45\n15:58\nbillion.\n16:01\nUm and then the discounted cash flow\n16:04\nvaluation the best case uh the\n16:06\ncalculated enterprise value is\n16:08\napproximately 11 billion and the upside\n16:10\ncase uh the enterprise value is 17.13\n16:16\nbillion uh which reflects more\n16:18\noptimistic growth and margin\n16:20\nassumptions. The downside case\n16:22\nenterprise value falls to approximately\n16:24\n4.42 billion under more conservative\n16:26\nconditions\n16:28\nuh and then incorporating at 1.2 2%\n16:32\nadditional annual revenue growth and a\n16:34\n2%\n16:35\npoint reduction in operating expenses\n16:38\nfrom synergies. The enterprise value for\n16:40\na strategic buyer is estimated to be\n16:43\napproximately 13.44 billion.\n16:47\nUm and then the comparable company\n16:50\nanalysis for the trading comps the\n16:52\nequity value which is the PE multiples\n16:54\nrange from 8.8 8 billion uh which is the\n16:57\nindustry PE of 22 to 14 billion which is\n17:00\nChipotle at 35X and the enterprise value\n17:04\nthe EV divided by EBITDA\n17:07\nmultiples range from 7.2 2 billion which\n17:10\nis an 8x to 9 billion which is 10x.\n17:15\nUm\n17:17\nthe precedent transaction analysis uh\n17:19\nbased on historical M&A multipliers uh\n17:22\nwhich is 12 to 15x the enterprise value\n17:26\nrange is estimated between 10.8 and 13.5\n17:29\nbillion. Um this method inherently\n17:31\nincludes a control premium.\n17:35\nUh and then the financial versus\n17:37\nstrategic buyer perspectives. Financial\n17:39\nbuyers primarily seek uh return on\n17:41\ninvestment through operational\n17:43\nefficiency and finance financial\n17:45\nstructuring uh valuing Panera closest\n17:48\ncloser to its standalone cash flow\n17:50\ngeneration which is around the DCF best\n17:53\ncase strategic buyers can justify our\n17:55\nhigher valuation due to their ability to\n17:57\nrealize substantial revenue and cost\n17:59\nsynergies quantified as 72 million in\n18:02\nrevenue synergy and 120 million in cost\n18:05\nsynergy in year 1 leading to a 13.44 44\n18:08\nbillion valuation but face higher\n18:11\nintegration risks. Management rollover\n18:14\nis crucial for financial buyers to align\n18:16\nincentives.\n18:18\nAnd then the recommended bid strategy\n18:21\nbased on a triangulation of valuation\n18:23\nmethodologies.\n18:25\nUh a proposed bid range for Panera is\n18:28\n10.5 to 12 billion. The recommended\n18:30\nwalkway price is nine and a half billion\n18:32\nwhich is above the high end of the\n18:34\ntrading comps range and significantly\n18:36\nbelow the DCF best case. And the\n18:38\nsensitivity analysis states that the\n18:40\nenterprise value shown showed\n18:43\nsensitivity to changes in WACC terminal\n18:45\ngrowth rate and synergy capture with\n18:48\nhigher valuations resulting from lower\n18:50\nWACC higher terminal growth and\n18:52increased synergy realization."
