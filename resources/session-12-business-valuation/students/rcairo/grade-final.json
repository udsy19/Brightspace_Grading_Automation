  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes unlevered free cash flows, applies discount factors to obtain present value and terminal value, and uses/varies WACC in sensitivity testing. These show a thorough, applied understanding of DCF methodology consistent with an introductory but comprehensive treatment, so PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value calculation (uses a terminal growth assumption and reports TV and its present value) and runs sensitivity analysis on terminal growth. The reported PV of terminal value (≈$8.2B) versus PV of cash flows (≈$2.8B) demonstrates awareness that TV comprises the majority of value, satisfying the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separated an explicit 5-year forecast from a terminal value, quantified near-term growth drivers (500 new stores, digital mix to 70%, year‑1 revenue/cost synergies) and used a conservative terminal growth (1.5%) with sensitivity analysis. This provides a thorough, numerically supported multi-stage growth rationale consistent with the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT taxes, CapEx, change in NWC) and computes unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) and its present value to derive enterprise value, showing conceptual linkage that FCF drives value to capital providers. However, the treatment is brief and somewhat unclear (e.g., no explicit discussion of depreciation add-back or an explicit statement that UFCF represents cash to all providers), so the response demonstrates correct but incomplete coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes enterprise value and reports equity value ranges (via PE and comps), showing conceptual understanding of valuation outputs (IMPLEMENT). However, there is no explicit statement or evidence that they subtracted net debt from EV to derive equity value nor that they divided equity value by share count to produce a price per share; therefore the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission compares results to peers and precedent transaction ranges and acknowledges at least one methodological limitation (control premium), showing external-facing sanity checks. However, the student did not name specific external sources/tools/databases used to validate numbers, so against the category-specific standard this meets only a partial pass.",
