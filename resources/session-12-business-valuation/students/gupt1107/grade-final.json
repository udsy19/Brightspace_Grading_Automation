  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript explicitly defines DCF as the present value of projected unlevered free cash flows, shows calculation of unlevered FCF, and applies a WACC (9%) to discount those cash flows and the Gordon-growth terminal value. The student therefore demonstrates thorough, correct introductory use of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (D&A, taxes → NOPAT, capex and working capital appear in projection tables) and computes unlevered free cash flow, and explicitly states that UFCF \"represents the cash flow available to all capital providers.\" The Implement and Discover stages demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements the Gordon growth terminal value formula and documents terminal-value support tables, and they acknowledge TV as a sizable portion of enterprise value while performing sensitivity analysis showing its material impact. These demonstrate a thorough, conceptually sound treatment meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the correct EV → Equity Value bridge by subtracting net debt (and other claims), and applies multiples to produce equity value figures. However, there is no explicit statement or example showing Equity Value divided by share count to produce a Price Per Share, so the criterion is only partially met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed sanity checks via sensitivity analysis, trading comparables, and precedent transactions, showing external benchmarking and convergence across methods. However, they did not name specific external sources/tools or cite where peer multiples/transaction data were obtained, so this meets only partial criteria under the category-specific standard.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student provides a clear, actionable recommendation in words (anchor on base-case DCF and midpoint of precedents; set walkaway near the upper bound) and supports it with numerical valuation ranges from trading comps and precedent analyses. However, they do not state a single explicit numeric bid or precise price threshold for KKR, so the recommendation is correct and supported but not fully specific — therefore PARTIAL.",
