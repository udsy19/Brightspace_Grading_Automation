  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs FCFF, projects cash flows, computes a terminal value via perpetuity growth, and uses a WACC assumption (with scenario variation) to derive enterprise value and sensitivity. Coverage is detailed and applied (projections, NOPAT, CapEx, working capital, terminal growth, WACC ranges), meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes and implements FCFF, naming NOPAT, non‑cash add‑backs (depreciation/amortization) and changes in CapEx and working capital, and uses it in a DCF to derive enterprise value—demonstrating that FCF is cash to the firm (available to all capital providers). The implementation and code representation provide applied, substantive treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models an explicit 5-year forecast with growth driven by store openings and then shifts to a lower perpetuity terminal growth (3%), plus sensitivity around 2–4%, demonstrating reasonable multi-stage growth reasoning. The combination of coding the growth vectors, implementing the DCF, and validating sensitivities provides thorough, defensible treatment of the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission correctly implements a terminal value (perpetuity growth at 3%) and performs sensitivity testing around terminal growth, showing awareness that terminal assumptions materially affect enterprise value. However, the student did not explicitly quantify or state that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value nor provide a breakdown/example of TV as a share of value, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly subtracts net debt to derive equity value (implemented in code), satisfying the first evaluation point. However there is no evidence they divided equity value by share count or reported a price-per-share calculation, so the criterion is only partially met.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly includes identifiable model sections—projections, terminal value method, and WACC choices—and demonstrates discounting/sensitivity (PV) workflows. However, while the student reports specific equity valuation outputs (e.g., ~$9.8B) and states the DCF \"yields my base case enterprise value,\" an explicit numeric enterprise value from the DCF is not clearly presented in the transcript, so the criterion is only partially met.",
