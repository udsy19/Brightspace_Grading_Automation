This is my section six\n\n3\n00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080\nassignment comprehensive business\n\n4\n00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,760\nvaluation. Um just a quick assignment\n\n5\n00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,000\noverview on this is we're going to\n\n6\n00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,000\ndeliver a full valuation of Panera Bread\n\n7\n00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,880\nfor a perspective KKR takeover using\n\n8\n00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,000\nDriver. Um, we're going to combine DCF\n\n9\n00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679\ntrading comps and DCF trading comps and\n\n10\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760\npresident transactions to produce an\n\n11\n00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120\ninformed bid range while contrasting\n\n12\n00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,920\nfinancial buyer discipline with\n\n13\n00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,920\nstrategic buyer synergies.\n\n14\n00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,120\nUm, just quick deal snapshot of this. We\n\n15\n00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960\nhave 6 billion revenue growing 8%.\n\n16\n00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,239\nUh, we have a $900 million ITA um $400\n\n17\n00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,320\nmillion net income and digital sales\n\n18\n00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,320\nalready at 50%. So our market\n\n19\n00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320\nreferences,\n\n20\n00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,520\nwe were capital assumptions and a growth\n\n21\n00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,920\nlevers. And basically I took all this\n\n22\n00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840\nand I have created an executive ready\n\n23\n00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360\nrecommendation. Um it shows our\n\n24\n00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040\nvaluation range, our winning bid\n\n25\n00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119\nstrategy and rationale for choosing\n\n26\n00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,479\nfinancial versus strategic positioning.\n\n27\n00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,080\nI use Google Gemini for this in the\n\n28\n00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,560\ndriver framework. So I'm going to show\n\n29\n00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,119\nyou that now.\n\n30\n00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,400\nUm so start from the top. We have we\n\n31\n00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,520\nhave defined and discover\n\n32\n00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520\nand basically I have my dictionaries\n\n33\n00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,479\nwhich is we have financials so revenue\n\n34\n00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159\netha net income net debt and shares out\n\n35\n00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,400\nour assumptions which is our tax rate\n\n36\n00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,479\nWCC base WCC stress term growth uh kex\n\n37\n00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,560\nwcc percent and da percent and then our\n\n38\n00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,200\nmultiples\n\n39\n00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560\nso our peera iita low and high and our\n\n40\n00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119\npresident low and high and then our\n\n41\n00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,479\nscenarios which is the case a bear which\n\n42\n00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,479\nis a recession and a bull which is a\n\n43\n00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,479\nstrategic.\n\n44\n00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399\nSo after we find these variables um it\n\n45\n00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440\nkind of ensures that we can identify and\n\n46\n00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,160\nupdate the model um if market conditions\n\n47\n00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640\nwere to change. So moving on to\n\n48\n00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,640\nrepresent implement\n\n49\n00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239\nwe have our run DCF function which\n\n50\n00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,040\nbasically just calculates everything and\n\n51\n00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,040\nbuilds our DCF model.\n\n52\n00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,920\nUm and this function basically bridges\n\n53\n00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,800\nIBITa to free cash flow uh by adding\n\n54\n00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,440\nback depreciation and subtracting net re\n\n55\n00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720\nnet reinvestment. Um and this basically\n\n56\n00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519\nensures our cash flow numbers are\n\n57\n00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,280\naccurate.\n\n58\n00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,560\nSo kind of moving along, we have our\n\n59\n00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319\nfive year projection loop, our bridge to\n\n60\n00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,120\nfree cash flow, and our formula.\n\n61\n00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,599\nAnd we have our validate,\n\n62\n00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200\nwhich um validates all of our data, make\n\n63\n00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400\nsure everything's correct, our evolve,\n\n64\n00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400\nif you were to take a step further,\n\n65\n00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,080\nwhich is strategic for financial versus\n\n66\n00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879\nfinancial, and then our reflection and\n\n67\n00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,680\nour kind of recommendation.\n\n68\n00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,440\nSo in my terminal in my output we have\n\n69\n00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480\nour objective which is just to determine\n\n70\n00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,480\na bid range for KKR financial uh versus\n\n71\n00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319\nstrategic buyers. Our key tension is\n\n72\n00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640\nbalancing a financial discipline against\n\n73\n00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,159\nstrategic synergies. Our data loaded\n\n74\n00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:25,560\nloaded is a $6 billion revenue a base\n\n75\n00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,560\nWCC of 9% and a base growth of 8%.\n\n76\n00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,120\nSo looking right here.\n\n77\n00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,239\nIf we look at our execution,\n\n78\n00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,239\num\n\n79\n00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,519\nwe have our revenue and then we have our\n\n80\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,680\nIBITa\n\n81\n00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,680\nor not\n\n82\n00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,799\nplus DNA and subtraction KEX. And this\n\n83\n00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,799\nis our unlevered free cash flow.\n\n84\n00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,159\nSo we we're projecting a healthy cash\n\n85\n00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,159\nflow growth. Um\n\n86\n00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360\nand the results are basically just show\n\n87\n00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,320\nthat\n\n88\n00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,560\num we have a 12.2 billion for base\n\n89\n00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,799\ncases.\n\n90\n00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,799\nAnd then\n\n91\n00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,840\nkind of moving on to our validate.\n\n92\n00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,919\nUm this is where we stress test our\n\n93\n00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,120\nassumptions. So this heat map kind of\n\n94\n00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,639\ncompares WACC against terminal growth.\n\n95\n00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,600\nUm you can see that if WCC rises 10%.\n\n96\n00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600\nOur values drop significantly.\n\n97\n00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680\nUm this defines our risk tolerance and\n\n98\n00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560\nhelps us set a hard floor for the bid.\n\n99\n00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,960\nSo let's say our terminal growth is only\n\n100\n00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,720\n2% but our WACCC is 10%. Our growth is\n\n101\n00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,720\nvery slow. Our impact of valuation is\n\n102\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720\nvery bad. However, if our terminal\n\n103\n00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720\ngrowth rate is high but our WCC is\n\n104\n00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,440\nlower, it's very good. So, our goal is\n\n105\n00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,240\nto kind of find a range in this area\n\n106\n00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,560\nfor our bid\n\n107\n00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,560\nand just kind of evolving this. Um,\n\n108\n00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,639\nwe have our financial buyer ceiling\n\n109\n00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,039\nand as a financial buyer uh KKR is\n\n110\n00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,000\ngrounded in the standalone value which\n\n111\n00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,520\nwe just calculated which is uh 11\n\n112\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,880\nbill583,000\n\n113\n00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,919\nor at 583 million. Our strategic senator\n\n114\n00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,400\npremium is plus\n\n115\n00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,320\n1 bill560 million and our strategic\n\n116\n00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:43,039\nbuyer ceiling is 13 billion143 million.\n\n117\n00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,880\nUm\n\n118\n00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560\nand this basically raises the strategic\n\n119\n00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,400\nceiling\n\n120\n00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,880\nby kind of being in an addition.\n\n121\n00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560\nAnd these are ranges that we used to for\n\n122\n00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,840\nour competition.\n\n123\n00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,840\nSo going down in our reflection stage\n\n124\n00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,400\num we reflect using this football field\n\n125\n00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,560\nchart.\n\n126\n00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,680\nSo we have our DCF\n\n127\n00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,680\num our intrinsic value is\n\n128\n00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680\n13,143,000.\n\n129\n00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080\nUm\n\n130\n00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800\nand then have a presidential\n\n131\n00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,880\ntransactions right here. The market\n\n132\n00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,240\nfloor for this deal\n\n133\n00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,240\num is higher averaging about 13.5\n\n134\n00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240\nbillion.\n\n135\n00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,759\nWell, this is the max or president with\n\n136\n00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,280\nthe kind of the average trading comps.\n\n137\n00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,960\nSo my recommendation for this is I\n\n138\n00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,360\nrecommend KKR submits initial bid of\n\n139\n00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840\n13.5 mil billion u which is 15 times the\n\n140\n00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,199\nIBIT multiple. The rationale's behind\n\n141\n00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,919\nthis is that market alignment. Um as you\n\n142\n00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000\ncan see on the chart 13.5 billion aligns\n\n143\n00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,639\nperfectly\n\n144\n00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319\nwith the trade comp basically average\n\n145\n00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599\nand then it is also at the peak of the\n\n146\n00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,280\npresident president. So basically nobody\n\n147\n00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,960\nnobody will be out bidding us but we\n\n148\n00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,800\nwill still be within our comp range.\n\n149\n00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,479\nUm\n\n150\n00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,400\nit also bridges the gap. So the price\n\n151\n00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,520\nabove our transit value is uh 13 13\n\n152\n00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,440\nbillion. Um and to make the numbers\n\n153\n00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,720\nwork, KKR must pitch a 10% management\n\n154\n00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800\nrollover and operational independence\n\n155\n00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,120\nthings that strategic buyer cannot\n\n156\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:38,400\noffer. And then our walkway price\n\n157\n00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,680\nis 14.2 billion. Um\n\n158\n00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400\nand then beyond this we are purely\n\n159\n00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,520\nspeculating on exits.\n\n160\n00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,280\nSo using our DCF strategic,\n\n161\n00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,160\nour financial, our president, and our\n\n162\n00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,560\ntrading comps, we can kind of see that a\n\n163\n00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,080\n13.5 billion offer is kind of the best\n\n164\n00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,520\ndeal. Um,\n\n165\n00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960\nour bid strategy submit 13.5 billion.\n\n166\n00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,319\nThe rationale behind this is that clears\n\n167\n00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,639\nthe president transaction floors to be\n\n168\n00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,599\ncompetitive discipline offers 10 to 50%\n\n169\n00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,520\ndiscount to strategic ceiling. Um our\n\n170\n00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479\nwinning lever KKR cannot win on price\n\n171\n00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,319\nalone against strategics. So we must\n\n172\n00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840\npitch a major rule of 10% in operational\n\n173\n00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,520\nindependence\n\n174\n00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,840\nand our walkway price is 14.2 billion um\n\n175\n00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520\nreturns compressed below 20% IRB on\n\n176\n00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,160\nthis.\n\n177\n00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,160\nSo this is my\n\n178\n00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,959\nrecommendation and this was section six\n\n179\n00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800\nassignment comprehensive business\n\n180\n00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,800\nvaluation. Thank you."
