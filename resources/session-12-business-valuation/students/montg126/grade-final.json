  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated across DCF, trading comps, and precedent transactions, provided numeric outcomes and a recommended bid, and performed sensitivity analysis (WACC vs terminal growth) to justify a valuation range. These elements demonstrate a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes identifiable DCF sections (projections, bridge to FCF, terminal growth sensitivity via a WACC/terminal-growth heat map) and reports specific numeric enterprise value(s) (e.g., 12.2B). DRIVER stages Represent/Implement/Validate are present and show a coherent DCF structure and calculated EV, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they produced a football‑field chart and summarizes DCF, trading comps, and precedent results with numeric ranges and a recommended bid (13.5B). That satisfies the criterion's requirement for a clear visual/table summary of different valuation results.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly constructs free cash flows from operating metrics and explicitly includes WACC in assumptions and sensitivity testing, showing conceptual understanding of discounting. However, they do not explicitly state DCF = present value of future free cash flows or show the actual discounting calculations in detail, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies core FCF components (EBIT/EBITA → add back D&A, subtract CapEx/net reinvestment and includes working-capital and tax assumptions) and implements a bridge to unlevered free cash flow. However, treatment is brief and lacks explicit discussion that unlevered FCF is the cash available to all providers of capital and deeper explanation/examples, so the response is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly models and stresses terminal assumptions (heat‑map comparing WACC and terminal growth) and uses multiples elsewhere, showing correct conceptual use of terminal value. However, they do not present an explicit terminal value calculation method or a clear statement that TV constitutes the majority of enterprise value; the sensitivity discussion implies its dominance but lacks thorough, explicit calculation detail—hence PARTIAL.",
