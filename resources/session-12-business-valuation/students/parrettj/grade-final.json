  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies FCF and describes its role in a DCF and explicitly discounts future cash flows and terminal value back to present, then sums discounted flows to produce enterprise value—demonstrating applied use across scenarios (IMPLEMENT). Although the WACC/discount-hurdle explanation is brief and informal, the student applies discounting appropriately and links it to valuation and deal decisions, satisfying an introductory-level, thorough practical treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected appropriate peers and explicitly calculated/applicated valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E), then used min/median/max multiples to produce enterprise/equity valuation ranges and bid guidance. The work shows a thorough, applied comparable methodology appropriate for an introductory level and meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated valuation using DCF scenarios, comparable multiples, and transaction comps, quantified ranges (min/max/mean) and adjusted for synergies/control premiums. They also recommended a target, initial, and walk-away price and justified using the midpoint/range, demonstrating a thorough, practical triangulation and sensitivity discussion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines FCF as cash after operating expenses and CapEx and links FCF to DCF/enterprise value (Implement), and notes EBITDA as a proxy for operating cash flow. However, they do not explicitly identify key FCF components such as EBIT/NOPAT and working capital adjustments, and treatment of depreciation/CapEx is minimal—so the understanding is correct but basic/incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes and calculates terminal value amounts and incorporates them into discounted enterprise values (Implement stage), demonstrating correct conceptual use. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF's value—this point is only implicit via large TV figures—so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly discussed, yielding a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period from a terminal period and constructs multiple scenarios with an explicit growth input (e.g., 0.05) and differing terminal outcomes (e.g., $5B–$15B). However, they do not provide thorough justification or discussion tying short‑term higher growth vs long‑term lower terminal growth (no detailed rationale or calibrated growth-rate choices), so the treatment is correct but too brief to meet \"thorough\" PASS criteria.",
