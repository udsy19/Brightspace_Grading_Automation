  "transcript": "Slide 1 — The Problem\n\nIn this project, we analyze whether a private equity firm should acquire CloudTech, a fast-growing SaaS company. While revenues are growing quickly, the company is still losing money due to heavy investment. The seller is asking for $500 million, and our job is to decide whether that price makes sense based on future cash flows and risk.\n\nSlide 2 — Discover\n\nThe first step is Discover. Here, the goal is to clearly define the problem and the key drivers of value. Instead of jumping straight into calculations, we identify what actually matters: revenue growth, profitability over time, risk, and terminal value assumptions. AI is used to help organize this thinking and ensure no major driver is ignored.\n\nSlide 3 — Represent\n\nNext is Represent. This is where we map out the financial story of the business. We connect revenue growth to margins, margins to free cash flow, and free cash flow to valuation. We also use a multi-stage model, recognizing that CloudTech will not grow at the same rate forever and will eventually mature.\n\nSlide 4 — Implement\n\nIn the Implement stage, we build the actual DCF model. With AI support, we project ten years of cash flows, model improving margins, and discount those cash flows using WACC. This gives us an estimated enterprise value, which we then compare to the $500 million asking price to calculate NPV.\n\nSlide 5 — Validate\n\nValidation is critical because valuation is very sensitive to assumptions. We test how the value changes when we adjust WACC or terminal growth. We also ask whether the results make sense from a business perspective, not just mathematically. AI helps us quickly run scenarios and stress-test our model.\n\nSlide 6 — Evolve & Reflect\nFinally, we Evolve and Reflect. Based on our analysis, we decide whether to buy or pass on the investment. More importantly, we recognize that valuation is not about finding one \"correct\" number. The DRIVER method, combined with AI, helps us manage uncertainty, think critically, and make better financial decisions."
