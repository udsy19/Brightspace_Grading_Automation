  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly identifies free cash flow as the basis for valuation and states that projected cash flows are discounted using WACC, then compared via NPV—meeting both required elements. Multiple DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate/Reflect) show a coherent, applied understanding beyond a mere mention, justifying a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission describes a systematic execution of the planned valuation workflow—building a multi-year DCF, modeling improving margins to FCF, discounting with WACC, and comparing to the ask—plus validation via scenario testing. Under the MODERATE standard, this conceptual and methodological evidence satisfies the Implement criterion even without raw code/spreadsheet files.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission correctly links margins to free cash flow and uses a DCF to derive enterprise value (implying FCF to the firm), demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, it does not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state clearly that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates conceptual awareness of terminal value (identified as a key assumption and stress-tested) and implements a multi-stage DCF, but it does not present a specific terminal value calculation (growth vs. multiple) nor explicitly state that TV typically comprises the majority of value. This correct but incomplete treatment fits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (ten years) and a terminal/mature state and highlights terminal value assumptions, demonstrating correct conceptual understanding. However, they provide no specific growth-rate assumptions or justification (short-term vs long-term rates), so the treatment is correct but high-level rather than thorough, meriting PARTIAL.",
