  "transcript": "My mission is to value Panera Bread for\n0:05\npotential KKR takeover and recommend a\n0:08\nwinning bid strategy for them to take\n0:09\nover Panera Bread. I triangulate three\n0:12\nmethods. A multi- scenario DCF trading\n0:16\ncoms and precedent uh transitions. Then\n0:19\nI'll explain why a financial buyers\n0:21\nprice discipline differs from strategic\n0:23\nbuyers uh like the synergydriven price\n0:26\nthat the strategic buyers have. Before I\n0:29\nbuild anything, I'm documenting the core\n0:31\nrules that I will be using today um for\n0:34\nmy mission 12 uh assignment. First, the\n0:37\nenterprise valuation principle. A\n0:39\ncompany's value equals to the present\n0:41\nvalue of its future and free cash flow\n0:43\ndiscounted for the WACC. Second, the\n0:46\nfree cash flow equals EIT um EVIT after\n0:51\ntax plus depreciation minus the capex\n0:54\nminus the working capital changes.\n0:57\nAnd uh lastly the terminal value often\n1:00\nrepresents around 60 to 80% of total\n1:03\nvalue. So I must stress my uh test upon\n1:05\nthe terminal assumptions.\n1:09\nSo here are the facts we have. Uh they\n1:11\nhave 8 billion in revenue. They're\n1:13\ngrowing 8% per year. A $900 million AITA\n1:17\nat 15% margin. 400 million net income\n1:20\nacross 2,100 stores across the country\n1:23\nwith digital already at 50% market\n1:25\nreferences. Industry PE about is about\n1:28\n22x resident and AITA multiplies 12 to\n1:31\n15X. Chipotle multiplies 15 35x which is\n1:35\na another like competitor McDonald's is\n1:38\n25x and management wants a 10% rollover.\n1:42\nSo a simple assumption that I will\n1:44\ntoggle is uh revenue growth margins\n1:46\ncapex percentage DNA percentage worker\n1:49\ncapital percentage WACC terminal growth\n1:52\nand synergy amount.\n1:55\nSo here's the flow I'm building. Revenue\n1:58\nand margins generate a beta. Subtract\n2:00\ndepreciation to get EBIT. The free cash\n2:04\nflow uh follows the class formula. EIT\n2:07\nminus one uh bracket open one minus T\n2:10\nand DNA capex. So now we'll implement\n2:14\nthe DCF in Python with a Python code.\n2:18\nThe downside, base, and upside scenarios\n2:20\nare uh included in this code. It's right\n2:23\nover here. And uh I'll keep every driver\n2:26\nadjustable. So in the video I can\n2:28\nquickly change assumptions and rerun\n2:30\neverything.\n2:38\nOkay. So the first table is the DCF\n2:41\nsummary uh enterprise value by scenario\n2:43\nterminal value share and implied\n2:45\nterminal uh the AITA check. I'm watching\n2:48\nterminal value share because the class\n2:50\nnotes that we like basically the notes\n2:52\nthat went in the session 12 say that\n2:55\nterminal value often accounts for 60 to\n2:57\n80% of the total value of the company.\n3:00\nThe second table is a five year\n3:01\noperating projection with free cash um\n3:04\nfor bridge for a non- finance viewer.\n3:08\nBasically what this means is free cash\n3:10\nflow is the cash that the business\n3:12\ngenerates after taxes uh and after\n3:15\nreinvesting in growth.\n3:18\nOkay. So now we come to the second uh\n3:21\ncode.\n3:23\nI will validate the biggest two value\n3:25\ndrivers discount rate and perpetual\n3:27\ngrowth because the notes say that\n3:29\nassumptions usually have the biggest\n3:31\nimpact on valuation. I'll quantify how a\n3:35\nstrategic buyer will pay more synergies.\n3:39\nOkay.\n3:41\nSo these this is a basic like\n3:43\nsensitivity table that we show and\n3:46\nbasically tells us why we don't trust a\n3:48\nsingle point to estimate small changes\n3:50\nto the WACC or terminal growth can move\n3:53\nvalue by billion. So as you can see the\n3:56\nsmall changes to this will move the\n3:58\nvalue by a lot more than the changes\n4:01\nwould like accumulate. So now the\n4:03\nsynergy table shows why strategics can\n4:06\nrationally basically pay more if they\n4:08\nbelieve they can extract between like\n4:11\n150 million to 300 million of recurring\n4:13\naida synergies and um the inrictive\n4:18\nvalue of the sh.\n4:22\nSo let's triangulate uh this. I\n4:24\ntranslate the provided coms and\n4:26\nprecedent multiples into valuation\n4:28\nranges. Then put everything on a\n4:30\nfootball field. This is how I get\n4:33\nexclusively ready to the bid range.\n4:41\nSo this football field shows basically\n4:43\nfour ranges for our valuation. The\n4:45\nstrategic DCF, the president deals, the\n4:48\ntrading coms and the DCF. So now my\n4:51\nrecommendation as KKR I anchor to the no\n4:54\nsynergy values and the precedent range\n4:57\nstrategics my outbid because they can\n5:00\njustify synergies. So the winning\n5:02\nstrategically for KKR would be to be\n5:05\naggressive on certainty and structure\n5:07\nbut disciplined on price.\n5:10\nSo my final recommendation will be the\n5:13\nenterprise value user triangulated band.\n5:16\nBut for KKR specifically I review and I\n5:19\nview a real realistic disciplined range\n5:22\naround the DCF. The winning bid strategy\n5:25\nI would open near the lower end of the\n5:26\nprecedent band obviously cuz why bit\n5:29\nmore and use negotiation points around\n5:33\nexcl like execution risk. Yeah. 500\n5:38\nstore rollout cost, dinner, catering,\n5:40\nadoption, uncertaintity and competitive\n5:42\npressure. I set a walk away at top of\n5:44\nthe scale uh of what a financial buyer\n5:48\ncan justify without synergies because\n5:50\nabove that I'm paying a strategic price\n5:52\nobviously management rollover would be\n5:54\n10% that improves alignment and reduces\n5:57\nthe cash needed at close but it does not\n5:59\nchange enterprise value. So it helps uh\n6:02\nstructure returns not the fundamental\n6:04\nvaluation.\n6:06\nSo yeah, those are all my\n6:08recommendations. Thank you."
