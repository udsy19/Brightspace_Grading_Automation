  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines enterprise value as the present value of future free cash flows and specifies discounting by WACC, then implements a multi‑scenario DCF and sensitivity checks on WACC and terminal growth. The combination of conceptual statement, practical implementation, and driver validation demonstrates thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value in their DCF implementation (adjustable perpetual/terminal growth and scenario outputs) and acknowledges TV typically comprises ~60–80% of total value, plus they perform sensitivity analysis on terminal growth/WACC. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly compared multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, and precedents), produced sensitivity analysis on key drivers (WACC, terminal growth), and presented a consolidated \"football field\" range. They also explained which valuations are most relevant for KKR (anchoring to no-synergy DCF/precedent ranges) and derived a practical bid recommendation, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT after tax, depreciation, capex, working capital) and describes FCF as cash after taxes and reinvestment tied to enterprise value, evidenced in the quotes and the planned DCF implementation. However, treatment is concise and formulaic without deeper worked examples or numeric walkthroughs, so the response demonstrates correct but basic understanding—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding of an explicit forecast period (5-year projection) versus a terminal period and uses scenario analysis and toggles for growth drivers, but they do not present specific short-term versus long-term growth rate assumptions or show clear numerical convergence to a lower terminal growth. Conceptual treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly works with enterprise value outputs and shows conceptual awareness of enterprise vs. deal/structure effects, but the transcript lacks an explicit EV→Equity bridge (no clear subtraction of net debt nor explicit division by share count to produce a price per share). That correct but incomplete treatment merits PARTIAL.",
