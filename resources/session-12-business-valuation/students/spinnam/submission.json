  "transcript": "Hi everyone. Today I'm going to be going\n0:03\nover assignment number 12 for my\n0:05\nmanagement 310 class.\n0:09\nWithin this assignment, we're going to\n0:11\nbe doing the define and discover,\n0:13\nrepresent, implement, validate, and\n0:15\nevolve and reflect. Today, we're going\n0:18\nto be going over define and discover. In\n0:20\nthis project, I'm going to be evaluating\n0:22\nPanera Bread as a potential acquisition\n0:24\ntarget for KKR using the driver\n0:27\nframework. The goal is to basically\n0:30\ncombine discounted cash flow analysis\n0:32\nwith traditional um trading comps and\n0:36\nprecedent transactions to come at a\n0:39\ninformed valuation range.\n0:42\nWe're also going to recognize financial\n0:44\nbuyers like KKR face different\n0:46\nconstraints than strategic buyers and\n0:49\nthis is our deal snapshot. We have to\n0:52\ndeliver a full valuation of Panera Bread\n0:54\nfor the prospective KKR takeover using\n0:57\nthe driver framework.\n1:00\nPanera Bread is scaled. It's profitable\n1:02\nbrand with multiple growth lovers\n1:04\nparticularly um digital and it can have\n1:07\nalso unit expansion but its valuation\n1:10\nmust be grounded and in a realistic\n1:14\num\n1:16\npattern instead of aggressive\n1:17\nassumptions. So the buyer's KKR targets\n1:21\nPanera bread transaction type should\n1:24\nprobably be a leverage buyout or private\n1:26\nequity acquisition.\n1:28\nThe objective is going to be a an\n1:31\nattractive risk adjusted returns with\n1:34\ndownside protection. The business\n1:36\nprofile is 6 billion revenue growing 8%.\n1:40\nOur ebida is 900 million with 50%\n1:44\nmargin. Our net income is 400 million.\n1:46\nThe stores is 2,100 and digital sales is\n1:48\n50% of revenue. Growth lovers is we have\n1:51\n500 new stores over 5 years. Digital mix\n1:54\nis 70%. We have dinner and catering\n1:56\nexpectation and early international\n1:58\ngrowth.\n2:00\nAll right. Another part of our define\n2:01\ndiscovers. This is going to set the\n2:04\ncontext for like our valuation\n2:06\num and looking at some of our challenges\n2:10\nand assumptions. So we have a mature\n2:14\nbusiness with moderate growth. We are\n2:16\nvery valuedriven and we have strategic\n2:18\nbiders. Then we have private equity and\n2:21\nvaluation disciplines. And then we are\n2:24\nalso going to have some critical\n2:26\nassumptions. So sustainable long-term\n2:28\ngrowth rate margin expansion versus\n2:30\ncompetitive pressure. We have\n2:33\nappropriate whack. We have um size and\n2:37\ncertainty of strategic energies as well.\n2:40\nBasically,\n2:42\nPanera Bread is going to be evaluated as\n2:45\na leverage buyout rather than a\n2:47\nstrategic acquisition. And KKR's\n2:49\nobjective is to generate like an\n2:52\nattractive risk adjusted return with\n2:55\nstrong downside projection which is\n2:57\ngoing to make the valuation discipline\n2:59\ncritical. Moving on to a represent slide\n3:02\nrepresents how value is created over\n3:04\ntime in private equity\n3:07\nacquisition. The KKR um pays today at\n3:10\nacquisition and then value was generated\n3:14\nover the first five years um through\n3:17\noperating growth and free cash flow and\n3:20\nthen beyond the explicit like forecast\n3:23\nperiod.\n3:25\nThe business is assumed to reach a\n3:26\nsteady state where value is captured\n3:28\nthrough a terminal flow and basically\n3:32\ngoing to be followed um at the exit\n3:37\nsale. Right? This framework basically\n3:39\nshows that Kr's investment is justified\n3:42\nby future cash flows and um rather than\n3:46\nthe current earnings, but that\n3:49\nsignificant portion of value comes from\n3:51\nterminal value and exit assumptions.\n3:53\nBecause of this, we're going to have to\n3:55\nmake sure timing and discipline around\n3:57\nthe end of our like decision is\n4:02\nimportant because it's critical for\n4:04\nprivate equity returns. Um,\n4:10\nbasically the way we're going to be\n4:13\nanswering the question is we're going to\n4:14\nrepresent Panera's values creation\n4:16\nframework. We're going to build a\n4:19\nscenario. We're going to build a DCF.\n4:21\nThen we're going to run trading comps\n4:23\nand president transactions. Triangulate\n4:25\nthe valuation range and recommend bid\n4:28\nrange and strategy for KKR.\n4:31\nMoving on to another part of our\n4:33\nrepresent. This slide represents the\n4:34\nmechanics behind the valuation. Value\n4:37\ncreation starts with revenue growth and\n4:39\nthen um which drives IBIDA and operating\n4:42\nprofit. Therefore, we're going to adjust\n4:44\nour taxes and noncash charges, spending\n4:47\ncapital, and working capital investment\n4:49\nto arrive at a free cash flow. All\n4:52\nright. Free cash flow is then discounted\n4:55\nat the weight average cost for capital\n4:57\nto determine enterprise value. This\n5:00\nframework is going to highlight why\n5:01\nassumptions around growth, margins,\n5:03\nreinvestment, or whack are going to be\n5:06\nsuper important and key drivers of\n5:09\nvaluation. Free cash flow basically\n5:11\nmatters because it represents cash\n5:14\navailable that investors can like have.\n5:17\nIt is also independent of financing\n5:19\nchoices and it is a big foundation of\n5:23\nprivate equity valuation.\n5:31\nAll right. Another one of our slides\n5:33\nhere in our represent slides is um this\n5:37\nbig\n5:39\ntable over here. This is a base case and\n5:43\nit reflects the expected growth and\n5:45\nstable margins. Um the upscale case\n5:49\nbasically assumes faster unit growth and\n5:52\nhigher digital like um\n5:56\nimplementation and margin expensive\n5:59\ndriven by some operational like\n6:02\nefficiencies. The downside case is\n6:05\nbasically a case that reflects slower\n6:07\ngrowth and um one case that has margin\n6:12\npressure from competitive risks. So\n6:15\nbasically understanding both of these uh\n6:18\nscenarios is going to help me understand\n6:20\nthe range of both outcomes and the risk\n6:23\nprofile of the investment.\n6:28\nBasically we're going to evaluate Panera\n6:30\nunder multiple scenarios rather than\n6:32\nrelying on one forecast. And then this\n6:36\nis one of our um formulas that we're\n6:39\ngoing to be using the enterprise value.\n6:41\nSo DCF logic\n6:44\nThis formula basically shows Panera's\n6:46\nvalue is driven by free future free cash\n6:49\nflows and terminal value and is\n6:51\ndiscounted for risk. Um this is going to\n6:55\nshow what the valuation is. It's going\n6:57\nto link future cash flows to today's\n7:00\nvalues. Um so that's why we're using\n7:02\nthis. This is our free cash flow\n7:05\ndefinition conceptual um formula. This\n7:09\nis going to define cash flows being\n7:11\nevaluated and it shows reinvestment\n7:14\nlogic and it's going to be essential for\n7:17\nprivate equity framing.\n7:20\nThen we have terminal value structure\n7:22\nformula. This belongs in represent\n7:26\nbecause it's going to highlight why\n7:28\nterminal assumptions are going to be\n7:30\nimportant. It explains why long-term\n7:32\ngrowth matters more than early years.\n7:35\nAnd we don't have any um numbers just\n7:39\nyet. So this is our equity value bridge\n7:43\nhigh level. So this is the values to get\n7:46\nour equity value. We do enterprise value\n7:49\nminus net debt. And this shows how\n7:52\nvaluation flows to owners. It's\n7:54\nimportant uh to also help us figure out\n7:57\nthe logical takeover. And it is a simple\n8:00\nyet intuitive formula for us to use.\n8:05\nAll right, we have our trading comms\n8:07\nlogic. We have PE U multiple and then we\n8:10\nhave our IBIDA multiple. This is going\n8:12\nto show how the market benchmarks work\n8:15\nand it's going to explain the difference\n8:17\nbetween um uh differences of DCF. And\n8:25\nmoving on, we're going to go to our\n8:26\nbuyer lens logic.\n8:29\nThis is financial versus strategic\n8:31\nbuyer. And um this is going to explain\n8:35\nour bidding tension and going to show\n8:38\nKKR why they have to be disciplined.\n8:42\nAnd then moving on to our implement.\n8:46\nThis is my code.\n8:50\nThis is the Panera bread valuation for\n8:52\nKKR takeover.\n8:54\nAnd this is over here we have our Panera\n8:57\ninputs. And this is where we implement\n8:59\nall of the values that Panera has given\n9:01\nus from their company. And we have our\n9:03\ncapital assumptions, our modeling\n9:05\nhorizons,\n9:06\nconverting IBIDA for FCF. Then we have\n9:10\nmarket references.\n9:12\nAnd then we have our scenario\n9:13\ndefinitions, our downside, base, and our\n9:15\nupside. We have our core functions over\n9:18\nhere that we went over in our represent\n9:19\nslide.\n9:21\nAnd then we also have our terminal value\n9:23\nof year NFC FCF. And we have our trading\n9:26\ncomps, equity value, our president,\n9:29\nprecedent, transactions, strategic\n9:32\nsynergy, sensitivity DCF. We have our\n9:34\nrun model, and we're going to also be\n9:36\nprinting it all out over here. And then\n9:38\nwe also have our own validate DCF,\n9:41\nright? And then it's going to validate\n9:43\neach stage. It's going to have integrity\n9:45\nchecks and reasonable checks, you know,\n9:48\nuh basically understand the patterns and\n9:50\nit's going to cross-ch checkck the EV\n9:51\nand compent if provided and they will be\n9:55\nprovided and it returns if anything is\n9:59\ngoing to be changed or flagged and so\n10:02\nthat's good. Then we have our cross\n10:04\nvalidation and multiples. This is all of\n10:07\nthe things getting um checked and then\n10:10\nwe're going to have all of our results.\n10:12\nSo this is our Panera valuation model.\n10:15\nUh so right over here we have our whack\n10:17\nour tax, our terminal, our horizon, DCF\n10:20\nscenario downside, DCF scenario base,\n10:22\nDCF scenario upside, we have our trading\n10:25\ncomps, our president transactions, our\n10:27\nfootball field valuation ranges. We have\n10:29\nour strategic buyer length CF\n10:31\nsensitivity.\n10:32\nAnd then\n10:34\nwe also have our validation stage. So\n10:38\nour validation report for um\n10:42\nuh\n10:44\ndownside, our validation report for the\n10:46\nbase, a validation report for the upside\n10:49\nand a valid and then we also have our\n10:51\nbasic sensitivity and we have synergy\n10:54\nand capture sensitivity and we have a\n10:56\nbid strategy placeholder. So those are\n10:58\ngoing to be all of our results over here\n11:00\nwhich will be really good to have.\n11:01\nMoving on, we're going to go to our\n11:03\nfirst implement slide. This implement\n11:06\nslide is going to show how I structured\n11:08\nthe uncertainty in the model. Instead of\n11:10\nrelying on a single forecast, I defined\n11:12\nthree scenarios, downside, base, and\n11:14\nupside. And each with its own revenue\n11:16\ngrowth and margin path. The model loops\n11:18\nthrough each scenario. So I can\n11:20\nbasically see how the valuation changes\n11:23\nunder different operating incomes. Over\n11:25\nhere, I define all the model's core\n11:27\nassumptions in one place. This includes\n11:30\num Panera's like starting financials and\n11:32\nthe Panera inputs, the discount rate,\n11:35\ntax rate and long-term growth\n11:37\nassumptions as well as reinvestment\n11:39\nneeds like cap X and working capital um\n11:42\ncentralization.\n11:44\nAnd these inputs make the model\n11:46\ntransparent and easy to adjust.\n11:50\nover here. This slide basically explains\n11:52\nhow the model converts all of our\n11:54\noperating formulas into cash onto free\n11:58\ncash flow from\n12:00\nyeah from all of these different\n12:02\nformulas being used and computed.\n12:04\nStarting from Ibida, I'm going to\n12:06\nestimate um EBIT and apply taxes to get\n12:10\nthe um no PAT basically after tax\n12:15\noperations and then um then I subtract\n12:18\nthe reinvestment needs like capital\n12:20\nexpenditures working capital and then\n12:22\nthe result is going to be free cash flow\n12:24\nwhich represents the cash available to\n12:27\ninvestors.\n12:29\nThen we have um\n12:32\nthis slide over here. And once all of\n12:34\nthat free cash flow is calculated, I'm\n12:36\ngoing to discount um each year's cash\n12:39\nflow back today using whack over here.\n12:42\nAnd then I calculate the terminal value\n12:44\nto basically capture Panera's long-term\n12:47\nsteadystate cash flows and discounts\n12:50\nthat as well. And then adding all these\n12:52\nuh together actually gives us the\n12:54\nenterprise value right over here.\n12:58\nAnd then to avoid relying on just one\n13:01\nvaluation method, I triangulated the DCF\n13:05\nand that results in trading comparables\n13:08\nand precedent transitions. And this is\n13:10\nalso going to help ensure that the\n13:12\nintrinsic value implied by the DCF is\n13:15\ngoing to be constant, right, with how\n13:18\nsimilar companies are priced in the\n13:19\nmarket and in recent deals. So this is\n13:23\ngood because um basically we're going to\n13:26\nget our intrinsic value the market\n13:27\nsanity check and then um valuation\n13:31\ntriangulation which is good. Then\n13:33\nfinally I wanted to validate the model\n13:36\nby testing its sensitivity to key\n13:38\nassumptions like the discount rate and\n13:40\nterminal growth. I also checked that the\n13:42\nterminal value does not dominate the\n13:44\nvalidation value and that the results\n13:47\nbasically fall within a reasonable\n13:49\nmarket range. Right?\n13:52\nThis is where we're calculating the\n13:53\nintegrity. And then this is going to\n13:56\nbasically ensure that our conclusions\n13:57\nare going to be accurate and actually\n14:01\nable to be used.\n14:04\nAll right, now we're moving to our\n14:06\nresults. This slide shows the outputs\n14:08\nfrom the valuation model. After I ran\n14:11\nthrough all of the implementation code,\n14:13\nI ran a discounted cash flow analysis\n14:15\nunder a downside base and upside\n14:18\nscenario. Across all the cases, Panera\n14:20\ngenerates strong and growing free cash\n14:23\nflow which is going to drive enterprise\n14:25\nvalue. In the downside case, the\n14:27\nvaluation actually um remains supported\n14:31\nby stable cash flows which is basically\n14:33\nindicating a strong downside protection\n14:36\nand the base case over here um produces\n14:40\nenterprise value just under $10 billion\n14:43\nright over here.\n14:46\nand the upside case\n14:49\num exceeds $1 billion and it's going to\n14:52\nbe driven by faster growth and margin\n14:55\nexpansion. So that's pretty cool. So\n14:58\nbasically the terminal value of these\n15:00\nthree quarters of total value across\n15:03\nscenarios um it's going to represent\n15:06\nlike the terminal value like within\n15:10\nthese three quarters. So it's a\n15:12\nreasonable for like a mature cash\n15:16\ngenerating business. But then I\n15:17\ntriangulated\n15:19\nall of these uh DCF results against\n15:22\ntrading comps and um president\n15:25\ntransactions to establish an even more\n15:28\ncredible value range.\n15:32\nAnd then this slide basically\n15:34\nsynthesizes all the valuation methods\n15:36\ninto a single decision framework. And\n15:39\nthe football field shows that Panera's\n15:41\nvaluation range is going to be supported\n15:43\nacross the DCF trading comps and\n15:45\npresident transactions. It's going to\n15:47\nalso have a overlap from um in the low\n15:50\nto mid double digits. Um so you can see\n15:54\nthat and then we have sensitively\n15:56\nanalysis that confirms the valuation is\n15:59\nmost affected by the discount rate and\n16:01\nterminal growth growth assumptions\n16:04\nreinforcing basically the need for\n16:06\ndisciplined pricing. So when we look at\n16:10\nthis through the strategic buyer lens,\n16:13\num you're going to see that even like\n16:16\nmodest synergies can justify a higher\n16:19\nenterprise value, explaining why\n16:20\nstrategic buyers actually may outbid\n16:22\nfinancial sponsors. So basically based\n16:25\non this analysis, KKR should anchor its\n16:28\nbid to the base case of DCF\n16:32\nand then set a clear walk away price and\n16:34\navoid overpaying in the competitive\n16:37\nauction. All right,\n16:40\nmoving on to our validate stage. We have\n16:43\nour validation report. All right, so\n16:45\nthis is a report for one of the upsides.\n16:48\nThen we have our validation report for\n16:52\nthe base right over here. And then we\n16:54\nhave another validation report for the\n16:57\ndownside.\n16:59\nIn this validation uh stage, I basically\n17:01\nran a set of automated checks in Python\n17:03\nto basically make sure that the model\n17:05\nbehaves consistently with corporate\n17:07\nfinance theory. And then um\n17:13\nit's good because it's able to help me\n17:16\nunderstand which um notes and checks are\n17:20\ngoing to be passed and if not it'll\n17:22\nbasically tell me that something is\n17:24\nwrong. So that's going to be really good\n17:27\nbecause I'll be able to validate all of\n17:30\nthe values and numbers and see if things\n17:34\nwork. So that's good. So, we're checking\n17:36\nto see if the whack is greater than\n17:38\nterminal G. Great. It worked. Pass. Um,\n17:41\nso we're going to be checking it\n17:43\ntheoretically, which is really good.\n17:45\nMoving on to our evolve stage. This is a\n17:47\nDCF versus um, uh, LBO table. And this\n17:52\nis going to basically\n17:55\ntell us how there's another way to\n17:57\nevolve our case study. So basically to\n18:00\nevolve this analysis I would actually\n18:02\nextend the DCF to a full LBO framework\n18:05\nto evaluate KKR's equity returns. So not\n18:08\njust the enterprise value. Basically I\n18:11\nwould explicitly model operational\n18:13\nimprovements such as digital um\n18:17\nuh penetration and store productivity\n18:20\nrather than\n18:23\nkeeping them in\n18:25\nimplicitly.\n18:27\nSo\n18:29\nI think like looking at um applying\n18:33\nprobably probability weighted scenarios\n18:36\nand also um making sure like the store\n18:40\nproductivity is working well and also\n18:43\nlike we're going to have multiple\n18:46\num sensitivities within this check would\n18:48\nbe better and it would also better\n18:50\nreflect like the private equity's\n18:52\ndecision making right so then comparing\n18:55\nKKR's returns to a strategic strategic\n18:57\nbuyer outcomes explains why strategic\n18:59\nbuyers may actually um outbid financial\n19:03\nsponsors. So like we'll be able to\n19:06\nevaluate Panera through a DCF model and\n19:09\nthen um LBO answers. Um\n19:13\nso like is Panera worth it? Is it at a\n19:16\nfair price? Does it what is it the\n19:18\nreturn does to KR? And how much debt is\n19:21\noptimal? So we'll be able to answer\n19:24\nthese two questions if we also add in\n19:26\nthe LBO table.\n19:28\nMoving on\n19:31\nto our results. Um Panera's intrinsic\n19:34\nenterprise value from DCF is basically\n19:37\nfalling within the president transaction\n19:40\nrange which is 12 to the power of uh 12\n19:44\n- 15x EDA. And then the base case\n19:46\nsupports evaluation around the seller's\n19:48\nask but only under reasonable execution\n19:51\nassumptions. The downside case still\n19:53\npreserves the significant value while\n19:56\nindicating indicating low fundamental\n19:58\nrisk. The upside case requires strong um\n20:02\nexecution and store growth in a digital\n20:04\nmix and margin expansion.\n20:08\nPanera evaluation and buyer\n20:09\nimplications.\n20:11\num\n20:13\nrepeating all of these other things, the\n20:16\nvaluation is really sensitive to whack\n20:18\nand terminal growth assumptions and\n20:21\nbasically the results show that Panera's\n20:23\nintrinsic enterprise value falls within\n20:25\nthe president transaction and it ranges\n20:28\nunder reasonable assumptions. The\n20:31\ndownside case provides strong value\n20:33\npredict protection while the upside case\n20:36\ndepends on how successful of a execution\n20:39\num growth and digital initiatives have.\n20:42\nAnd the sensitivity analysis basically\n20:44\nconfirms that the valuation is most\n20:46\nimpacted by whack and terminal growth\n20:49\nassumptions. While the situation\n20:51\nbasically does work for KKR at\n20:53\ndisciplined prices, you're going to have\n20:55\nto be strategic and buyers can actually\n20:58\npay more due to operational synergies.\n21:01\nSo, going back to our main question,\n21:04\ndeer a full evaluation of Panera for\n21:06\ntheir respective KR takeover, combine\n21:09\nall of these things, right, and produce\n21:12\nan informed range while\n21:14\ncontrasting financial buyer discipline\n21:16\nwith strategic buyer synergies. Great.\n21:19\nSo we basically did that and we created\n21:22\nthree different outlines. The base case,\n21:24\ndownside case, and upside um upside\n21:27\nupside case, right?\n21:30\nAnd our bid strategy placeholder is we\n21:33\nwant you to walk away if the price is\n21:36\nnear to the mid of the DCF range, right?\n21:39\nSo that's going to be our financial\n21:41\ndiscipline. Our target bridge range is\n21:43\nanchored to our base DCF with support\n21:46\nfrom comps and precedences. And\n21:48\nbasically, if the strategics basically\n21:52\npush above our price, we're going to\n21:55\nhave to walk away and you're going to\n21:57\npass unless the synergies can be um\n22:00\ncaptured by KKR.\n22:03\nBut that's going to be kind of rare, but\n22:05\nbasically KKR should anchor its bid to\n22:08\nthe base case DCF and then set a clear\n22:12\nwalk away. So our base case DCF is um\n22:17\nour PV explicit for our FCF is going to\n22:20\nbe 2.37 billion. Our PV terminal is 7.37\n22:24\nbillion. Um then we have a enterprise\n22:28\nvalue of 9.74 billion. And then key to\n22:31\ncheckpoint yearbyear is all of these\n22:34\nvalues. All right. Thank you for\n22:37watching."
