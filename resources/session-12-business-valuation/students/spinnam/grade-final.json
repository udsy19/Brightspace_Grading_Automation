  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF as the present value of future free cash flows and repeatedly states that those cash flows are discounted using WACC, with model implementation, scenario analysis, terminal value treatment, and validation checks. Coverage is detailed and applied (model, scenarios, sensitivities), meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies the FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, noncash adjustments implied, CapEx, working capital) and describes the conversion process in the model, and also states that FCF is cash available to investors and independent of financing. Those conceptual statements plus implementation in the driver-modeled DCF demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding sufficient for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both implements a terminal value calculation in the model (and reports PV terminal) and explicitly explains that a significant portion of value comes from terminal value, with sensitivity/validation checks. These elements across Represent, Implement, and Validate demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meriting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the equity-value bridge (EV − net debt) and implemented a DCF producing an EV, so the core concept is present. However, they do not show dividing the resulting equity value by share count (no price-per-share calculation or result), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses WACC to discount enterprise free cash flows and implemented it in the model with validation checks, demonstrating conceptual correctness. However, they do not provide or justify a specific, defensible WACC value (no industry benchmark or calculated WACC shown), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses trading comps/precedent transactions and references EV/EBITDA-style multiples (12–15x) and triangulation with the DCF, showing conceptual application. However, they do not list specific comparable peers (e.g., Chipotle, McDonald's) or show explicit step-by-step application of the multiple to Panera’s metrics, so treatment is correct but incomplete.",
