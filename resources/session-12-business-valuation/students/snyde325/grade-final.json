  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the DCF as projecting free cash flows for five years, discounting to present value, and adding a terminal value, and they specify a WACC (9%) and perform sensitivity (e.g., raising WACC to 10%). These concrete descriptions, implementation via code, and sensitivity analysis demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly uses WACC as the discount rate in a FCFF/DCF framework (implementation evidence) and supplies a defensible input (9% from the case) plus a sensitivity test to 10%, demonstrating awareness of WACC's effect on value. The DRIVER stages (Discover→Implement→Reflect) show both application and critical reflection, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant peers (McDonald's/Chipotle) and applied transaction and trading multiples (12–15x EBITDA, P/E ranges), showing concrete calculations (0.9 * 12 = $10.8B; 0.9 * 15 = $13.5B). They implemented these methods via the DRIVER-based code, triangulated results with DCF and comps, and provided actionable bid guidance, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct, applied understanding that FCF is central to DCF valuation and important to financial buyers (Discover + Implement), but it does not explicitly identify key FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or decompose the calculation. That partial coverage merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly includes a terminal value calculation (Gordon growth) implemented in the DCF, demonstrating correct conceptual use. However, the student does not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically represents the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast period and a terminal value (Gordon growth) and runs multi-scenario sensitivity, demonstrating correct conceptual structure. However, they do not show a justified long-term (terminal) growth rate or explicit rationale that long-term growth is lower than near-term (only an 8% short-term figure is stated), so the multi-stage growth reasoning is correct but incompletely justified.",
