Um, we're just going\n00:00:05.040 to dive right in. So, I started on\n00:00:08.080 Gemini and I asked it um a prompt create\n00:00:13.120 a Python code that answers the\n00:00:14.559 assignment. Use the kids principle and\n00:00:15.920 driver method to make it super easy to\n00:00:18.240 understand and teach someone with little\n00:00:19.760 finance knowledge. And I put the\n00:00:21.840 assignment in there and it gave me this\n00:00:25.039 code at the top. Um, so we're going to\n00:00:27.760 run it. Um we have the inputs um and\n00:00:32.238 everything. Oh sorry I for also forgot\n00:00:33.920 to say the defined discover. So our goal\n00:00:36.000 of this assignment is to determine a\n00:00:38.160 valuation range for Panera Bread for a\n00:00:40.879 KKR financial takeover and compare it to\n00:00:44.320 a strategic buyer like McDonald's. Some\n00:00:46.960 of our data we hob is the revenue at $6\n00:00:49.280 billion growing at 8% the IBIDA at $900\n00:00:53.199 million at 15% net income at $400\n00:00:56.000 million um comps or peers industry um\n00:01:00.399 her earnings is 22 times Chipotle is 35\n00:01:02.800 times um president transactions or the\n00:01:05.600 IBIDA multipi multiples is 12 to 15\n00:01:08.320 times and WACC or discount rate is 9%.\n00:01:11.840 And our problem is our financial buyers\n00:01:13.680 or the KKR they care about cash flow and\n00:01:16.159 debt pay debt pay payowns and our\n00:01:18.960 strategic buyers McDonald's care about\n00:01:20.960 synergies or cost savings and we need to\n00:01:23.040 model both of them. So um our DCF model\n00:01:26.720 it's um the project 5 years of free cash\n00:01:30.000 flow to the discount to present value to\n00:01:33.439 add terminal value. um the comparable\n00:01:35.920 models which is multiply current UDA by\n00:01:39.280 earnings by market multiples and then\n00:01:42.159 scenario toggle. So create a base case\n00:01:43.920 for the KKR and a synergy case for\n00:01:46.079 strategic to see the difference and then\n00:01:48.000 also a football field visualizing the\n00:01:50.240 range of values to pick a winning bid.\n00:01:54.399 Um so um starting off with our code I\n00:01:59.360 ran it. Here we go. Um this is like all\n00:02:01.360 our inputs that we got from the case. So\n00:02:03.920 current financials, the DCF assumptions,\n00:02:06.479 market multiples of soldiers from the\n00:02:08.239 case, um the DCF engine, um it does the\n00:02:12.560 loop for 1 to 5 years and it has um the\n00:02:15.120 revenue, the IBIDA, the free cash flow,\n00:02:18.800 the discount um SCF to present value and\n00:02:22.560 then also uses the Gordon growth method\n00:02:24.879 and calculates that for us. And then it\n00:02:26.959 also gives out the scenario. So KKR the\n00:02:31.120 financial buyer with no synergy is\n00:02:32.720 McDonald's the strategic buyer with 2%\n00:02:34.640 margin synergy. The president\n00:02:36.560 transaction with multiple markets and\n00:02:39.280 then finally trade trading comps and PE\n00:02:42.319 ratio based on income. And then our\n00:02:44.560 output is this. So there we go. The KKR\n00:02:49.200 bid is the DCF base is 7.4 billion. Our\n00:02:52.959 strategic bid is 8.73 billion. Our\n00:02:56.560 market comms or IBIDA is 10.8 8 billion\n00:02:59.120 to 13.5 billion and our market comms for\n00:03:02.000 PE is 8.8 billion to 14 billion and my\n00:03:06.239 recommendation is to conserve bid start\n00:03:09.040 at 10.8 billion which is 12 times IBIDA\n00:03:12.800 and the maximum walkway price at 7.4\n00:03:15.920 billion4 billion in the intrinsics value\n00:03:18.800 and then strategic buyers may pay up to\n00:03:21.519 $8.73 billion.\n00:03:24.000 Okay. So, we had that, but um I asked\n00:03:27.440 Gemini again um to do the chart because\n00:03:32.480 it said it would make it, but it didn't.\n00:03:34.319 So, I asked them to do that football\n00:03:36.000 chart. So, here's the code for this. So,\n00:03:37.680 it's setting up the data um defining the\n00:03:40.480 labels. So, the min and max bar lengths\n00:03:42.720 and then creates the chart for me and\n00:03:44.400 adds labels and the recommendations.\n00:03:46.879 Um,\n00:03:48.640 and then it says we chose 11.5 billion\n00:03:50.959 for the conservative entry point. It\n00:03:53.120 formats it and everything. And here we\n00:03:55.440 go. So, I'll run that. Here's the chart\n00:03:59.040 so you can see um the context. So, this\n00:04:01.519 is a football field chart. It summarizes\n00:04:04.400 our um\n00:04:07.280 um triangulation. So, the gray bars\n00:04:10.319 represent the market, what others are\n00:04:12.000 paying. Um the blue bar is our DCF or\n00:04:15.519 KKKR. And notice it sits comfortably\n00:04:18.639 within the president um transaction\n00:04:21.680 range. So the 10.8 to 13.5 billion. And\n00:04:26.160 it confirms our math is grounded in\n00:04:28.960 reality. And then the insight. So\n00:04:30.960 strategic versus financial. The red bar\n00:04:33.120 over here it shows a strategic buyers\n00:04:35.280 range because they can achieve\n00:04:36.560 synergies. They can afford to pay up to\n00:04:38.800 $15 billion. and explains um that we\n00:04:41.520 must be disciplined with our bid and we\n00:04:43.360 cannot win a bidding or against a\n00:04:45.520 strategic buyer solely just on the\n00:04:47.199 price. And then the recommendation is um\n00:04:50.960 by the green line over here. So we\n00:04:53.040 should recommend an opening bid of 11.5\n00:04:55.919 billion. Um this gets us in the door but\n00:04:59.280 leaves room for negotiation. And also um\n00:05:02.960 I asked Gemini again cuz it was missing\n00:05:04.400 some points based off the requirements.\n00:05:05.680 it was missing um\n00:05:09.039 um the downside scenario. So the um the\n00:05:11.919 downside definition scenarios dictionary\n00:05:14.880 um and then it was also missing the\n00:05:18.720 sensitivity matrix and the rollover\n00:05:20.880 calculation. So I asked to do that. So\n00:05:23.600 if I run this\n00:05:26.800 um it finds all of that for me. So\n00:05:29.680 updated scenario base with the downside\n00:05:31.759 part of it instead of just um the other\n00:05:33.919 ones and it does it for upside base and\n00:05:36.800 downside. And then we have our\n00:05:38.960 assumptions that's just from the case\n00:05:40.720 and then the um multi scenario GCF\n00:05:45.680 function which we found earlier too.\n00:05:48.960 Sensitivity analysis but like a visual\n00:05:51.840 um it's not like anything else crazy.\n00:05:55.440 and then um the rollover calculation as\n00:05:58.479 well and then we run it and then we get\n00:06:01.440 everything. So our um downside scenario\n00:06:04.080 so the code um now has this and it's\n00:06:07.520 protecting um\n00:06:12.160 yeah the downside case is 4.52 billion.\n00:06:15.039 The base case is 7.04 billion. Upside\n00:06:18.560 case is 9.48 billion. And here's our\n00:06:21.759 sensitivity table.\n00:06:25.360 Um just a\n00:06:28.560 all this. Yeah. And then um our rollover\n00:06:31.759 calculation\n00:06:33.520 is down here. Um so we have the total\n00:06:36.240 buyout price for the base at 7.04\n00:06:38.479 billion. The market rollover for 10%\n00:06:40.560 at.7\n00:06:42.160 billion. And um\n00:06:45.680 the cash KKR needs to pay is 6.34\n00:06:48.880 billion.\n00:06:50.319 So this rollover calculation, it just\n00:06:52.160 calculates a 10% rollover. Um\n00:06:56.560 you understand that the KKR doesn't have\n00:06:59.120 to pay 100% in cash and management is\n00:07:01.919 keeping um like the skin in the game.\n00:07:05.360 And then like validating all of this. So\n00:07:08.240 um our IBIDA was $0.9 billion and the\n00:07:11.039 president deals are 12 * 15 by 5. Um,\n00:07:17.440 and then\n00:07:19.840 0.9 * 12 is $10.8 billion. Um, 0.9 * 15\n00:07:25.520 is $13.5 billion. And our code output\n00:07:29.199 jet. So if our DCF outputs $50 billion,\n00:07:31.440 we know it's wrong cuz it's too high.\n00:07:33.440 And if it's outputs or is $2 billion,\n00:07:35.759 it's too low. And the D DCF should land\n00:07:38.400 somewhere near the market multiples,\n00:07:40.319 which is approximately $10 billion to 14\n00:07:42.479 billion.\n00:07:44.319 Um, like I said, the prompt asked for\n00:07:46.560 sensitivity on the WACC. In a real\n00:07:49.840 conversation presentation, you would um\n00:07:51.680 do like a what if scenario. Um, but like\n00:07:55.199 so what if the interest rates rise in\n00:07:56.960 the WACC goes to 10%. So um we need to\n00:08:00.639 change WACC\n00:08:02.560 to 092\n00:08:05.280 uh 10 in the code and rerun it. So\n00:08:07.919 that's what I did here. and then the\n00:08:10.000 valuation will drop and this helps the K\n00:08:12.160 KR decide if they should be careful with\n00:08:13.919 their bid price. Um\n00:08:17.280 yeah, I already went over how they\n00:08:19.199 missed a downside case for the multi\n00:08:21.440 scenario DCF in the management rollover.\n00:08:23.440 Hence why got the this over here and\n00:08:26.240 then ending off our for investment\n00:08:28.240 thesis um Panera is a strong asset with\n00:08:31.280 $6 billion revenue and a high digital\n00:08:33.200 penetration of 50%. Um the bid range we\n00:08:36.159 recommend an opening bid of 11 billion\n00:08:38.880 or approximately 12.2 times Ibida. This\n00:08:42.880 um anchors us near the president\n00:08:44.399 transaction floor. And then the ceiling.\n00:08:46.959 So our walkway prices 13.5 billion. And\n00:08:49.600 above this we're over paying compared to\n00:08:51.839 historical deals. Financial versus\n00:08:53.839 strategic or KKR or us. We must be\n00:08:56.399 disciplined. We cannot pay for\n00:08:57.519 synergies. We don't have um we create\n00:08:59.680 value by executing the 500 new store\n00:09:02.080 plans. And then the threat McDonald's or\n00:09:04.640 Starbucks can't afford to pay $14\n00:09:06.640 billion plus because they um can cut\n00:09:09.760 overlapping costs or synergies which our\n00:09:11.600 code showed increased um value\n00:09:14.240 significantly in scenario B. But that is\n00:09:17.040 all. Thank you guys."
