  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year explicit forecast from a Gordon terminal value and encodes plausible, time‑phased growth drivers (store openings, digital mix ramp to 70%, international from year 3) across multiple scenarios. That coverage is detailed and applied to valuation outcomes, satisfying a thorough multi‑stage growth reasoning standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant restaurant peers (McDonald's, Chipotle/CMG, Starbucks) and described using EV/EBITDA and P/E metrics, specifying precedent multiples (12–15x) and producing trading/precedent valuation bands. Coverage is applied to the bid recommendation and triangulated with DCF results, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of the comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated DCF, trading comps, and precedent transaction ranges, quantified each method's bands, and used synergy sensitivity to justify a sponsor bid range and walk-away threshold. That demonstrates a thorough, reasoned valuation triangulation and sensitivity discussion consistent with the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission correctly identifies DCF components (forecasting free cash flows and a Gordon-growth terminal value) and produces DCF output ranges, showing conceptual understanding. However, there is no explicit mention of using a discount rate or WACC to bring future cash flows to present value, nor a discussion of the chosen discounting approach, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct conceptual treatment of FCF as unlevered/free cash flows and mentions working capital and EBITDA-driven forecasts, but it does not comprehensively enumerate or explain key FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx) with detail or examples. Hence it meets partial but not thorough PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value method (Gordon growth) and runs a DCF model, so the TV concept is present. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value or quantify TV's share; coverage is correct but basic, so PARTIAL.",
