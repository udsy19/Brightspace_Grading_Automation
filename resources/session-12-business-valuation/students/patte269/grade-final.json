  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear DCF workflow: projecting operating drivers that feed free cash flows, producing enterprise-value outputs, and explicitly testing discount-rate (WACC) sensitivity. Implementation details and validation through sensitivities indicate a thorough introductory treatment consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied both trading (P/E) and precedent (EV/EBITDA) multiples and translated them into implied values, demonstrating correct comparable methodology in practice. While peer names weren't spelled out, the analysis uses multiple comparable approaches and buyer-focused framing, meeting the moderate standard for a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares multiple valuation methods with specific numeric outputs (DCF, comps, precedents), performs triangulation into a clear low‑to‑mid $12B financial‑buyer range, and notes sensitivity testing—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct but partial grasp: they model DCFs and explicitly project EBITDA and capital intensity (touching on operating profit and capex drivers), and produce enterprise values (implying cash-to-capital providers). However, they do not explicitly identify key FCF line items (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all providers, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently comprehensive for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses a DCF and five-year projections (Represent/Implement) and reports enterprise values, but the submission contains no explicit terminal value calculation or discussion of method (growth vs. multiple) nor any acknowledgement that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value. Therefore the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (five years) and uses reasonable short-term growth and margin assumptions, demonstrating partial mastery. However, they do not state or justify a terminal-period (long-term) growth/transition assumption or explicitly show a lower perpetual growth rate, so the multi-stage growth reasoning is incomplete.",
