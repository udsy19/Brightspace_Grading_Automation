  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly constructs a DCF from projected unlevered free cash flows, normalizes terminal cash flow, and applies an explicit unlevered WACC (9%) with sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, correct introductory treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly lists and models EBIT/NOPAT flow items (depreciation, capex, working capital, taxes) and constructs normalized unlevered free cash flows in the DCF. Their use of unlevered WACC and enterprise-value framing demonstrates understanding that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implements a terminal value calculation (normalized steady‑state FCF then Gordon growth) and documents key checks (g < WACC). They also report terminal value contribution and run sensitivities to WACC and growth, demonstrating awareness of the terminal value's dominant influence—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of net debt and consistently reports and uses enterprise value, but the submission does not explicitly show subtracting net debt to derive Equity Value or dividing by share count to produce a Price Per Share. Thus the understanding is correct but incomplete — PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the valuation object (Panera Bread), the acquisition context, and repeatedly names KKR as the financial sponsor—satisfying those elements of problem framing. However, the submission does not explicitly identify \"Management\" (or equivalent internal stakeholder) as required; under the strict DRIVER standards this omission prevents a full pass.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly performed external market validation using trading comps and precedent transactions and ran sensitivity/scenario checks (Validate and Represent stages). However they did not name specific external data sources, vendors, or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, specific companies), so external validation is present but not fully specific — hence PARTIAL.",
