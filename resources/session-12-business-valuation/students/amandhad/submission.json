  "transcript": "Hi there. I'm not 100% sure if you can\nsee my camera, which is why I'm doing a\nsplit screen, but this way you can see\nmy face and then I can go over the code\nas well. Um, so this is my video for the\nsession 12 assignment and in this video\nI'll walk through my full valuation\nmodel for Panera Bread build to\ndetermine disciplined acquisition price\nfor KKR. I structured the analysis using\nthe driver framework define discover\nrepresent implement validate and reflect\nand I use a triangle value triangulate\nvalue using a DCF trading comps\nprecedent transaction scenario analysis\nsensitivities and a final football field\nsynthesis. I'll start by defining the\nproblem and assumptions and walk through\nhow the model is constructed in code and\nfinally conclude with an executive level\nbid recommendation. So starting off with\nthe define and discover stage of the\nderma framework. The core problem is\nwhat is Panera Brad's worth to a\nfinancial sponsor like KKR and how does\nthat compared to a value of a strategic\nbuyer that could justify using\nsynergies. So this distinction is clear\ncritical because KKR should not pay for\nvalue it cannot realize and here I\nexplicitly verify the key assumptions\nwhich is required by the rubric. So I\nused a unlevered whack of 9% which\navoids distortion from buyer specific\ncapital structures. I applied terminal\ngrowth rate of 2.5% with an explicit\nquadril that terminal growth must remain\nbelow whack to prevent mathematical and\neconomic inconsistency. I also defined\nPanera's LTM operating profile revenue\nof $6 billion IBIDA of $9 million net\nincome of $400 million and net debt of\n$500 million. Finally, I define\nstrategic synergies as 10% of LTM IBIDA\nwith only 80% capture probability and\nRAM starting at zero in year 1 and\nreflecting realistic integration delays.\nMoving into the represent stage, the\nvalue model is structured around a store\nlevel operating driver. Let me just\nscroll down for you here real quick.\nAnd so essentially revenue is calculated\nas store count times sales per store\nwhich allows growth to be driven by both\nnew store openings and same store sales\ngrowth and explicitly model maintenance\ncapex, growth capex per new store\ndepreciation, working capital investment\nand taxes to arrive at unlevered free\ncash flow. And so this represents state\nthis representation ensures the model is\neconomically intuitive, transparent\nrather than relying on blackbox growth\nassumption assumptions.\nNow, let me just scroll down a little\nbit for you. And so, I'll explain the\nmodel, how the model is implemented in\nthe code. So, the run DCF function\nbuilds a 5-year projection for any\nscenario and buyer type. So, first,\nstore count grows based on the scenario\nspecific assumptions based upside or\ndownside, which directly affects the\nrevenue. The sales per store grows each\nyear using a defined growth schedule\nscaled up or down by scenario. Ibida is\ncalculated by using margin expansion\nassumptions again adjusted by scenario.\nFor strategic buyer only, I layer in\nIBIDA synergies using a RAM schedule and\nprobability haircut. And financial\nbuyers receive no synergies which\npreserves valuation discipline from\nIBIDA. I subtract depreciation to get\nEBIT, apply taxes only when EBIT is\npositive and compute no.\nOh my gosh,\nI'm not screen sharing. I'm so sorry\nabout that.\nOkay. Yes, you should be able to see me\nand the screen now. I am so sorry about\nthat. Just to quickly give you a recap\nof everything I've talked about. So,\nhere are all of my assumptions and my\nparameters. This is the define part um\nwhere I list everything. Here is the\nagain define and discover and the\nreflect the represent part as well of\nthe driver framework. Um and then here\nis the DCF model which I kind of explain\nin detail for you. I'm talking about the\neBay, I'm talking about the notepad, the\ncap x, all of that. Um and yes, so sorry\nabout that. Completely slipped my mind.\nThis is my first time using Zuma. So I\nusually use Cultura Media Gallery, but\ntoday I tried recording it twice and it\ndeleted my video both times. So here I\nam trying something new. But yes, going\nback to where I was. So to validate the\nmodel, I go ahead and run all the\ncombination of buyer type and operating\nscenario. Um\nand this allows me to compare the base\nof the model with the upside and\ndownside outcomes for both financial and\num strategic buyers. But I just want to\nmake sure that I talked about the\nterminal value as well. Um\nso talking about terminal value before I\nget into that um a critical requirement\nof the rubric is terminal value\nnormalization and this explicitly is\nimplemented. So instead of blindly\ngrowing a year five free cash flow I\nremove growth capex from year 5 to\nestimate a steady state free cash flow.\nSo this reflects the assumption that\nPanera cannot expand at the same price\nor same pace forever avoiding the\noverstating terminal value. And so this\nnormalized steadystate cash flow is then\ngrown at a terminal growth rate and\ncapitalized using the Gordon growth\nformula.\nNow going on to the scenario summary\ntable. To validate the model, I run all\ncombination of buyer type and operating\nscenario. And this allows me to compare\nthe base upside and the downside\noutcomes for both financial and\nstrategic buyers. For each case, I\nreport the enterprise value implied LTM\nEV to EBIDA multiples and terminal value\ncontribution. I then perform a two-way\nsensitivity analysis across the whack\nand the terminal growth. And this\ndemonstrates how sensitive valuation is\nto macro assumptions and confirms so\nthat my recommendation is not driven by\na single optimistic input. I also\ncalculate the synergy delta which\nisolates how much additional value each\nstrateure strategic buyer can justify\nrelative to a financial buyer.\nAnd so that is my recommendation before\nI get into that. Um here I can talk\nabout some comparable and precedential\ntransaction analysis. So as an external\nand this is an external market chart. So\nI use a pure set of seven comparable\nrestaurant companies and extract first\nquartile median and third quartile EV to\nIBITA and PE multiples. I convert all\nmultip all valuation outputs into\nenterprise value ensuring consistency\nwith the DCF. President transaction are\nanchored at 12 to 15 times IBIDA which\nestablishes a realistic acquisition\nrange observed in the market. All\nvaluation methods are then synthesized,\nlet me just scroll down for you, in a\nfootball field analysis, which is a core\nrubric requirement. So this chart\nvisualizes com visually compares value\nranges from trading comps, presidented\ntransaction, financial buyer DC, and\nstrategic buyer DCFS. So I explicitly\noverlay KKR's recommended bid range,\nwhich is anchored above the president\nfloor but capped below the strategic\nbuyer synergy adjusted value. And this\nclearly shows where KKR can compete\nwithout destroying returns.\nFinally, in the reflect stage, I\ntranslate the analysis into an executive\nlevel recommendation. So, our\ndisciplined walkway price is 12.8\nbillion in enterprise value, which\ncorresponds to 14.2 times LTM EV to\nEbido multiple. The bid range is\nanchored on the financial buyer base\ncase DCF of 11.93 billion constrained by\na precedented transaction values between\n10.8 8 and 13.5 billion and\nintentionally set below strategic buyer\nbase case value of 12.58 billion. We\nrecommend a financial bid range of 11.69\nbillion to 12.80 billion in enterprise\nvalue. The strategic buyer base case is\n12.58 billion which implies a synergy\nvalue of 0.5\n0.65 billion relative to the financial\nbuyer valuation. that that represents a\n5.4% premium over financial buyer's\nintrinsic value and the financial\nbuyer's intrinsic value is materially\nbelow the strategic buyers base case\nvalue which reflects KKR's\nsynergies cannot fully realize. So by\nrefusing to pay for the full synergy\npremium KKR preserves IRR discipline and\navoids integration risk if the bidding\nexceeds our walkway price and the\nremaining value is driven by synergies\nthat are better captured by strategic\nacquirer. In conclusion, this model\nsatisfies all rubric requirements by\ncombining a structured driver framework,\na normalized DCF, marketbased valuation\ncheck, sensitivity analysis, and a clear\nexecutive ready recommendation. So the\nfinal bit is disciplined, defensible,\nand grounded in Panera's free cash flow\ngeneration rather than a speculative\nupside. And so this you can see in my\noutput as well. So here I have the full\ndefine and rep define and discover\nrepresent check. I have my problem\nstatement, the key assumptions\nand then I have the comparative multiple\nsummary table, the multiple valuation\nranges converted to enterprise value\ntable, the DCF scenario, the DCF\nsensitivity financial buyer base case EV\num in millions. I have the DCF\nsensitivity chart and then my final\nexecutive recommendation and I also have\nthe football field triangulation chart\nfor you to see for your reference as\nwell. But yeah, thank you so much for\nlistening. I had a lot of fun in this\nclass. I've learned a lot and I'm very\ngrateful for all the key skills that I\nget to take away. Yeah, thank you forlistening."
