  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames intrinsic value via multi‑scenario DCF, provides the free cash flow formula, specifies a discount rate (WACC = 9%), and implements scenario DCF calculations in code—showing a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five-year explicit forecast from a terminal perpetuity (3%) and provides base/upside/downside short-term growth rates (5–10%), with scenario reasoning (digital adoption, store growth) supporting why short-term rates exceed terminal. These elements show a clear, reasonable multi-stage growth approach consistent with the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers and reported EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples, implemented calculations via Python, and produced a comps-based valuation range. This demonstrates a correct and applied comparable methodology at an introductory level with sufficient depth for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly lists the key FCF components (an earnings base times (1–T), depreciation, CapEx, change in working capital) and implemented them in code, showing conceptual understanding. However, they state EBITDA*(1–T) rather than EBIT/NOPAT*(1–T) and do not explicitly state that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but not fully precise or comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value calculation (perpetuity growth and implemented in code) and applies it in the DCF outputs, but they do not discuss that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of a DCF or analyze its impact/sensitivity. That omission limits depth, so the work meets a correct but incomplete treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports EV and corresponding implied equity value ranges (showing awareness of an EV→equity bridge) and used implemented code and triangulation to derive values, but they do not explicitly show the net debt subtraction nor any division by share count or price-per-share calculation. This demonstrates correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.",
