  "transcript": "My name is Colleen McCarthy and this is\nmy session 12 assignment on\ncomprehensive business valuation. Start\noff with define discover for the core\nquestion. It is what is the fair\nvaluation of Perential takeover by AKR\nwhich is a financial buyer. So I must\ndetermine a disciplined bid range that\ncreates returns for KKR investors while\nremaining\nwhile remaining competitive against\npotential strategic buyers like\nStarbucks or McDonald's who pay more to\nsynergies\nsynergies.\nSo these are the given data that we\nwill be using as inputs\nalong so for the financial objectives\nand deliverables\nto build a DC DCF model analyze you know\ntriangulate the value differentiate\nbuyers and lastly provide a final\nrecommendation.\nSo for a little knowledge check\nlist and the different terminology must\nclarify that they understand these\nconcepts like intrics versus relative\nvalue the WCC\nterminal value\nsynergies and control premium\nand then for the flow we're going to do\nthe intro show the DCF and the market\nview and then football field the idea\nand then defend it with the strategy and\nrecommendation AKR.\nSorry, my voice is a little wolf thick.\nOkay, moving on to the represent stage\nwith the analytical approach to\ndetermine a defensive bit for Panera\nBread. you can't really just look at one\nnumber and Sally will be doing the tri\ntriangulation\napproach which is also called football\nfield analysis\nand it's going to overlap these three\ndistinct values the valuation methods.\nSo first looking at the discounted cash\nflow and then the variable company\nanalysis\nand then\nlastly precedent transactions.\nAnd so what are we solving for? It's the\nenterprise value range that satisfies\nsatisfies KKR's return requirements\nremained against.\nSo these are the\nkey variables and inputs\nwe'll be using\nfor the code.\nAgain, give a little description of what\nwe mean. Now for some formulas\num\nwe have\nwe'll be finding terminal value using\nthis equation along with the present\nvalue using this equation and looking at\nrelative value relative valuation we\nhave the PE valuation\nand beta valuation as well these are all\nthe formulas here and we We'll be using\nPython.\nSo\nnow enter the valuation triang valuation\ntriangulation phase. Um again not\nlooking at a single not looking at a\nsingle number looking at these three\nthings and then the output will give us\nthe football field chart. So here is the\ncode\nand then here we have\na field chart.\nSo this chart above is the most critical\noutput for executive decision and a\nvisual overs these three methods. Here\nit is again. So you can see the floor\nthe bare case DCF and industry PE\nmultiples suggest a valuation floor of\naround 8.8 to 9.5.\nAnd this is just the minimum paneer is\nworth if gold stalls and it would\nabsolutely not been above this if we\nforesee a recession. It also tells us\nabout the target zone. So the base case\nDCF aligns closely with the president\ntransactions\nand this 13 to 14 billion range is a\nfair market value. So a financial buyer\nlike the AR would feel comfortable here\nbecause the cash flow is support price.\nAnd lastly it shows us the ceiling. So\nthe bull case DCF pushes value towards\nthe 18 billion and it assumes high\nsynergy realization.\nFor example, Hip's growth, but a strate\nwill not bid up to 16 because they can\ncut cost.\nSo our data suggests a winning bid for a\nfinancial buyer is likely 13 to$13.5\nbillion. So any more pushes toward the\nstatic range over 15 k should likely\nwalk away as returns would diminish\nbelow our require R. We're looking to\nvalidate. Um so did it work? The code\nexecute successfully and it gave a clear\nchart visualiz\nmethods and then\nwe're going to do a logic verification.\nSo for distrustingness, we're going to\ndo a quick mental check comparing all\nthese numbers here. And our the verdict\nhere is that our complex DCF output is\nalmost identical to the simple multiple\nmethod. And this confirms our WCC and\ngrowth assumptions are realistic and not\nbreaking the model. Lastly, to interpret\nthe validation proves we have a solid\nmid-range.\nYep. Okay. Now that's evolved. move on\nto the evolve stage. So the winner's\ncurse\nfor a strategic pivot,\nthe financial buyer discipline they are.\nSo you cannot count on these synergies\nlike Starbucks can. So you must be\ndisciplined and also for the air\nsolutions as management wants to roll\nover 10% equity. We can secure we can\nstructure the bid creativ creativity\ncan offer 13.2 upfront with the\npotential bonus\nand this bridges the gap without rising\nto get artists capital today. I'll take\na look at the debt verse equity and um\nthe working would not pay 100% cash. We\nlikely fund it and fund the purchase.\nAnd this uses debt using debt magnifies\nour return on equity as pan pays down\nthat debt using its\nmita\nequity value below car grows more\nrapidly. Lastly for the evolved\ncollusion he will not enter a bidding\nwar above 14.5 million. If this player\nbids 15, they're paying for synergies we\ndon't have and then we walk away. That\nis only valid decision of that.\nSo finally to reflect for the final\nrecommendation again based on\ntriangulation analysis we recommend K\nhours an opening pay 2.2. This is after\nwe look at the ceiling the rationale and\nthe differentation.\nSecondly the process. So again driver we\nstarted with discover then move to\nrepresent then implement validate and\nevolve and\ntook time at all the steps here. Lastly,\nfor personal affection and learning,\nmost the most profound realization from\nthis project is seeing the price versus\nvalue gap. The value of Panera might be\n13.5 to KKR, but 16 to Starbucks. So\nneither number is necessarily wrong.\nThey just represent different order\nstructures and with the help from driver\nframework, it can decouple the math and\nthe strategy and ensure I don't just\nsolve for a single number for a limiting\nbusiness deal.Thank you."
