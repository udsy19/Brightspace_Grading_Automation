  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses present-value and terminal-value formulas in a DCF, references WACC (as \"WCC\") in validating assumptions, and applies the DCF outputs to derive concrete valuation ranges, triangulating with multiples—showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly compares at least two valuation methods (DCF, multiples, precedents), presents numeric floor/base/ceiling ranges, validates consistency across methods, and discusses which valuation is appropriate for a financial buyer versus a strategic bidder. This meets the thorough conceptual standard for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission presents explicit valuations for multiple scenarios (floor ~8.8–9.5B, base ~13–14B, bull ~18B) and links higher value to growth/synergy assumptions while noting low-growth (recession) produces the floor. DRIVER stages—Represent, Implement, Validate—provide evidence the scenarios were modeled, executed, and checked, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a basic, correct use of DCF and treats cash flow as central to valuation, which indicates conceptual understanding (hence PARTIAL). However, the submission does not explicitly identify core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, so it falls short of the thorough treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value calculation and implements it in code (Implement), and uses DCF outputs in the valuation triangulation (Represent). However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value or discuss its sensitivity/weight; treatment is correct but brief, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of terminal value and uses DCF modeling with validation of growth/WACC assumptions, but does not explicitly distinguish an explicit forecast (high short-term) growth period versus a lower terminal growth rate or provide specific growth-rate assumptions and rationale. That meets a correct but incomplete conceptual treatment, so PARTIAL.",
