  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes a DCF that projects free‑cash flows, discounts \"each year's cash flow\" and adds a terminal value, and specifies WACC assumptions (9% / 9.5%) and sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, applied introductory grasp of DCF methodology consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both specifies defensible WACC values (9% baseline, 9.5% for KKR discipline) and applies WACC to discount projected enterprise cash flows in their DCF, with sensitivity testing for robustness. These elements demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding satisfying the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly compares multiple valuation methods (DCF, comparable multiples, precedent transactions, and strategic buyer analysis), synthesizes them in a football-field to produce a bid range, and provides a clear recommendation (midpoint of base DCF and precedent range) plus sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound triangulation and sensitivity treatment consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of FCF within a DCF to derive enterprise value and buyer decisioning (Discover/Implement), but they do not explicitly identify or discuss the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital). Thus the treatment is correct but too high-level for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly includes a terminal value calculation (Gordon growth) and tests sensitivity to terminal assumptions, showing conceptual understanding. However the student did not explicitly state that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value; that implicit awareness (via sensitivity testing) is insufficient for a full, thorough treatment, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five‑year explicit forecast from a terminal value and uses scenario-specific (base/upside/downside) short‑term growth assumptions, showing awareness that near‑term growth drivers differ from perpetuity assumptions. However, they do not provide explicit, justified terminal growth rate choices or numeric rationale that long‑term growth is lower than short‑term—only sensitivity testing—so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",
