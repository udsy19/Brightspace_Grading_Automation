  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines free cash flow and the Gordon terminal-value formula, states they discount five-year flows plus terminal value, and uses a stated WACC (9%) as the discount rate; the implementation (calculate_DCF function and scenario toggles) demonstrates applied use. This is a thorough, correct introductory treatment of DCF methodology appropriate for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified key FCF components (tax-adjusted operating earnings, D&A, CapEx, and change in working capital) and stated that UFCF is cash available to all capital providers. They also implemented the calculation in code and used the resulting FCF flows in valuation and recommendation, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers and cited multiple trading and precedent multiples, then applied those multiples to derive valuation ranges and a recommended bid. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Validate/Reflect stages shows a coherent, applied comparable methodology at an introductory but thorough level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a Gordon-growth terminal value formula and implements it in the DCF code and discounting (Implement stage), so the calculation requirement is met. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value or discuss its proportional impact, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast period and a terminal (Gordon) value and demonstrates short‑term growth scenarios (e.g., 8% historical, downside to ~4%) with scenario stress testing. However, they do not state or justify a specific terminal growth rate or explicitly argue why the long‑term G should be lower than near‑term growth, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes Enterprise Value and presents an EV-based bid, but there is no evidence they subtracted Net Debt (Debt less Cash) to arrive at Equity Value nor that they divided Equity Value by share count to produce a Price Per Share. References from the Implement/Validate/Reflect stages show EV work and recommendation but no net-debt subtraction or per-share calculation.",
