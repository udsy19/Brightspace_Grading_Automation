  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC as the discount rate in a multi-scenario DCF and cites a defensible industry WACC (9%) plus strategic/downside variants (8.5%, 9.5%) and sensitivity testing. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound application consistent with the moderate evaluation standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied at least two valuation approaches (DCF and comparables), compared the DCF-implied multiple (14.65) to the precedent range (12–15x), and performed sensitivity analysis showing input-driven valuation variability. They also discussed buyer-type differences and provided a strategic EV uplift, demonstrating a thorough triangulation and reasoned valuation range.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission clearly defines key parameters (WACC, growth assumptions, and market multiples) and documents multi-scenario and sensitivity testing showing the model reacts to input changes. The DRIVER stages (Represent through Validate/Evolve) provide evidence the inputs were parameterized and that scenarios/sensitivity runs produced alternative valuations, meeting the criterion for parameterized inputs.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies WACC in multiple scenarios and runs sensitivity analysis showing awareness of how discounting and terminal value drive DCF outcomes, but they do not explicitly define DCF as the present value of future free cash flows or provide detailed walkthroughs of cash flow discounting. This demonstrates correct but basic conceptual use, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission references DCF and reports EBITDA/net income and model outputs but contains no explicit discussion of Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor the conceptual statement that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. Therefore it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly acknowledges terminal value importance (explicitly stating TV contributes significantly) and used terminal growth sensitivity and an implied DCF multiple, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not present a clear, explicit terminal value calculation (perpetuity or exit-multiple formula) or show the numeric TV amount, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
