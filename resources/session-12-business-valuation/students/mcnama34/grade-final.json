  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly selected relevant peers (McDonald's, Chipotle) and explicitly applied an EBITDA multiple range (12–15x and scenario-derived 10–15x) to the subject's earnings, producing specific valuation outcomes and a recommended bid. Implementation and reflection stages show they ran sensitivity scenarios and used the outputs to set a rationale for an initial and maximum offer, demonstrating a thorough introductory comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares EBITDA multiples and a scenario/WACC-driven valuation, reports specific enterprise values and a valuation range (11.4–14.3B) and recommends a midpoint (12.8B), showing triangulation and sensitivity to WACC/growth. Use of implemented tools and reflective negotiation rationale supports a thorough, practical treatment, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission calculates valuation under multiple scenarios (base, low, high) with specific numeric results and explicitly identifies WACC (cost of capital) as a key driver affecting the valuation/multiplier. Using REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT/VALIDATE evidence, the student shows correct and sufficiently detailed scenario comparison to meet the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses WACC (9%) and multi-year scenarios to produce an enterprise value, indicating application of discounting methods. However, they rely primarily on EBITDA multiples and never explicitly state DCF as the present value of future free cash flows, so the treatment is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses EBITDA multiples and discusses enterprise value/WACC but never identifies Free Cash Flow components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor states that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers. Reliance on EBITDA/EV modeling without explicating FCF elements or its stakeholder allocation means the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission uses EBITDA multiples and multi-year projections to produce enterprise values, but it never explicitly calculates or labels a Terminal Value (growth or exit-multiple) nor notes that Terminal Value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF's value. Given the absence of an explicit TV calculation or acknowledgment, the criterion is not met.",
