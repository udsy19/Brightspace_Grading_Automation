  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models projected free cash flows, discounts them using a stated 9% WACC, includes a terminal value, and reports resulting enterprise values while triangulating with comparables—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly triangulated valuation using DCF and multiples, discussed key sensitivity drivers (WACC, terminal growth, margins), and produced a defensible bid range with buyer-specific rationale. While detailed sensitivity tables were not shown, the conceptual treatment and cross-checks meet the moderate standard for a thorough, defensible valuation.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission explicitly includes identifiable DCF sections—projections (five-year FCF from EBITDA), discounting at a 9% WACC, and a terminal value (2.5% growth)—and reports a specific enterprise value (~$11.7B, with additional range statements). These concrete inputs and outputs plus comparables validation meet the criterion at a thorough level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual approach (projecting FCF and discounting at WACC to get enterprise value), indicating awareness that cash flows are for the firm. However, they do not explicitly identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or show adjustments from EBITDA to NOPAT/FCF, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included a terminal value (growth method) and implemented it in a DCF, and they acknowledged terminal growth as a key sensitivity. However, they did not explicitly state that terminal value typically represents the majority of total value or provide deeper exploration (e.g., TV share, alternative TV methods or sensitivity analysis), so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast from a terminal period and uses reasonable short-term (~8%) versus long-term (2.5%) growth assumptions, showing conceptual understanding (Discover + Implement). However, treatment is basic—no year-by-year growth taper, transitional staging, or discussion justifying the terminal rate relative to macro factors—so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.",
