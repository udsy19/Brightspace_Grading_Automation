I projected free cash flow using EBITDA as a base and discounted it using a 9% WACC.\"\"I also included a terminal value using a 2.5% long-term growth rate.\"\"This produced an enterprise value of about $9 to $10 billion, depending on assumptions.\"\n________________\n\n\nImplement – Comparables\"I then checked the valuation against market multiples.\"\"Using EBITDA multiples between 12x and 15x, Panera's valuation range is roughly $10 to $13.5 billion.\"\"Using P/E multiples between 22x and 35x gives a wider range, but supports a premium valuation for strategic buyers.\"\n________________\n\n\nValidate\"The DCF result falls within the comparable valuation ranges, which tells me the assumptions are reasonable.\"\"Sensitivity comes mainly from WACC, terminal growth, and margin assumptions.\"\n________________\n\n\nEvolve\"A financial buyer like KKR would likely target the lower end of the range to preserve returns.\"\"Strategic buyers could justify paying more due to synergies from digital scale, store overlap, and operating leverage.\"\n________________\n\n\nFinal Recommendation\"My recommended bid range is $8.5 to $10.5 billion.\"\"KKR should stay disciplined near the low end, while strategic buyers may push higher.\"\n________________\n\n\nClosing\"This valuation integrates DCF, comparables, and strategic reasoning using the full DRIVER framework.\"\"That concludes my Section 6 valuation.\"\n\n\n\n\nNow I'll walk through the valuation results.\nFirst, my DCF model gives an enterprise value of about $11.7 billion, which represents Panera's intrinsic value based on projected cash flows discounted at a 9% WACC.\nNext, I sanity-checked this using market multiples. Using EBITDA multiples of 12 to 15 times, Panera's value ranges from $10.8 to $13.5 billion, which brackets the DCF result nicely.\nI also looked at P/E multiples. Applying industry and premium brand multiples gives a wider range of $8.8 to $14 billion, which reflects differences between mature restaurant chains and high-growth brands like Chipotle.\nWhen I triangulate all three methods, the most defensible bid range for a financial buyer like KKR is $8.5 to $10.5 billion. This range sits below intrinsic value, provides downside protection, and supports private-equity return targets.Strategic buyers could justify paying toward the high end due to synergies, but for KKR, discipline supports bidding near the low end of the range.\""
