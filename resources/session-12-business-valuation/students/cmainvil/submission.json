  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, this is management 310 assignment\n0:04\n12. The objective for this assignment,\n0:06\nwe have to deliver a full valuation of\n0:08\nPanera Bread for a perspective KKR\n0:10\ntakeover, which is a private equity\n0:12\ngroup. We are going to be combining uh\n0:15\nDCF models, trading comps, and president\n0:18\nU transactions to produce an informed\n0:20\nbid range while contrasting financial\n0:22\nbuyer discipline with strategic buyer\n0:24\nsynergies.\n0:26\nTo do this, I will be using Google\n0:27\nStudio AI. But let's go ahead and dive\n0:30\ninto the define and discover.\n0:34\nSo firstly, what we have to do is create\n0:37\nan executive ready recommendation that's\n0:39\ngoing to state our valuation range or\n0:40\nwinning bid strategy and then also\n0:42\nexplain our rationale for choosing a\n0:44\nfinancial or strategic positioning.\n0:48\nWe're given this data here where we can\n0:51\nsee the scale of the business. We can\n0:52\nsee the market references, the capital\n0:54\nassumptions and the growth levers.\n0:58\nUsing this data and also some of these\n1:00\nassumptions, we are going to go ahead\n1:02\nand perform this analysis. So to dive\n1:05\ninto that analysis, we're going to have\n1:07\nto build a multi-senarial uh discounted\n1:10\ncash flow model um that shows the base\n1:13\nupside and downside with a five-year\n1:15\noperating projection uh free cash flow\n1:17\ndetails uh cost of capital justification\n1:20\nand terminal value support.\n1:24\nOnce that's done and we get that out of\n1:25\nthe way, we're going to run a comparable\n1:27\ncompany and precedent uh transaction\n1:30\nanalyses using defensible peer sets. And\n1:32\nthen we're going to also show the\n1:34\nmultiples that were used and translate\n1:36\nthem into valuation ranges for Panera.\n1:38\nThis will give us a better understanding\n1:40\nof how the overall market is looking um\n1:44\nand comparing the competition within.\n1:47\nThe third step of our analysis, we're\n1:49\ngoing to have to assess the financial\n1:50\nversus strategic buyer perspectives. So,\n1:53\nfirst we're going to have to quantify\n1:54\npotential synergies, which basically is\n1:57\nwhich basically is saying how will this\n2:00\ncompany run after acquiring this other\n2:02\ncompany and if it's in good synergy,\n2:04\nthen it should allow the company to\n2:05\ncreate more value. But besides that,\n2:07\nwe're going also to discuss control\n2:09\npremiums, integration risk, and\n2:11\nmanagement rollover implications.\n2:14\nDoing this step is very crucial because\n2:16\nit's always important to get multiple\n2:17\nperspectives especially before um making\n2:20\na huge investment like this. Lastly,\n2:22\nwe're going to triangulate the\n2:23\napproaches via a football field um or a\n2:25\ndifferent synthes synthesis, but we will\n2:27\nbe using a visual football field. Then\n2:29\nwe're going to recommend our bid\n2:31\nstrategy with walkaway price,\n2:32\nnegotiation, talking points, and uh\n2:35\nfinancing considerations.\n2:37\nSo, how exactly are we going to do this?\n2:39\nLet's go ahead and look into our\n2:40\nrepresent framework.\n2:43\nSo using Google Studio AI, um we're\n2:46\ngoing to first build a multi- scenario\n2:48\ndiscounted cash flow model. So it's\n2:50\ngoing to be shown five years out with a\n2:52\ndetailed analysis and justification to\n2:54\nthe free cash flows, cost of capital,\n2:55\nand the terminal value.\n2:58\nNext, we're going to do some\n2:59\ncomparisons. So we're going to look at\n3:01\ndefensible pier sets. We're going to\n3:02\nfind those multiples and then also\n3:04\ntranslate that into ranges visually.\n3:07\nNext, we're going to compare the\n3:09\nfinancial and strategic buyer\n3:10\nperspectives. Um, as said earlier, we're\n3:12\ngoing to look at the potential\n3:13\nsynergies, discuss premiums, integration\n3:14\nrisk, and also management rollover\n3:16\nimplications.\n3:18\nLastly, we're going to show uh visually\n3:21\nthe ranges and then we're also going to\n3:22\nprovide a recommendation that is\n3:24\nexecutive ready uh with a bidding\n3:26\nstrategy and then why we think it's the\n3:27\nbest plan throughout our whole analysis.\n3:30\nUm, assumptions will be provided.\n3:32\nSo, now that we have a clear visual\n3:34\nframework and we've walked through our\n3:36\num define and discover and represent\n3:39\nstages, let's go ahead and dive into our\n3:41\nimplement stage. We're going to try to\n3:42\ncapture evidence as the work progresses\n3:44\nrather than summarizing all at the end.\n3:46\nSo, we're going to try to implement that\n3:47\nthrough.\n3:49\nUh before I walk through this, um my\n3:52\nchat logs with Gemini had to get reset\n3:54\nbecause it was not updating the file\n3:56\nanymore when I was telling it what to\n3:57\ndo. So, I had to reset it up here and\n3:59\nthe rest of the chat got deleted. So,\n4:01\nI'm not going to be able to walk through\n4:02\nthe prompts that I used,\n4:04\nbut the way I went about building the\n4:06\nprompts was executing them and typing\n4:09\nthem up with chat GPT to see how I could\n4:11\nmake them better and then working\n4:13\nthrough that. This probably took me\n4:14\nabout three hours to complete total.\n4:17\nLet's go ahead and dive in. So, our\n4:19\nstarting point as shown here, we are\n4:21\ngiven 6 billion in revenue. We have a um\n4:25\nearnings before uh income tax\n4:27\ndepreciation and am an ammonization at\n4:30\n900 million and then net net income at\n4:32\n400 million with a store count a little\n4:34\nover 2,000.\n4:36\nSo what we're seeing is Panera is\n4:39\nentering this valuation with a solid\n4:41\nbase reflecting a healthy 15% margin\n4:43\nacross the 2000 store footprint. In our\n4:45\nbase case, we project uh stability\n4:47\ndriven by moderate store expansion and a\n4:49\nsteady digital adoption.\n4:51\nmargins are maintained as officially\n4:53\ngains offset inflationary\n4:55\npressures setting stable foundation for\n4:57\nthe DCF. So in our base case, this\n4:59\nalready looks great. This is just what\n5:01\nwe have. So now let's go ahead and look\n5:03\na little bit more into the analysis.\n5:05\nSo here's our operating scenarios and\n5:08\nprojections. I'll go through each case,\n5:10\nbut to start with our assumptions, we\n5:11\nhave a re revenue growth of um 8%. uh we\n5:16\nhave the margins at a flat 15% and then\n5:18\nuh working capital assumes the standard\n5:20\nneeds of about 5%.\n5:24\nBut given our growth assumptions and\n5:26\nother assumptions this is what we have\n5:28\ncame up with. So\n5:31\nsort of talk about this effectively uh\n5:33\nlet's look at the base case. So for free\n5:35\ncash flow we can see that they are\n5:36\nexpanding every year which is perfect.\n5:38\nAnd then the present value of free cash\n5:40\nflow which is our DCF um our DCF number.\n5:44\nUh we can see that it's getting\n5:45\ndiscounted each year. In the base case,\n5:48\nthis looks uh pretty good to me. Let's\n5:50\nlook at the upside case. Now um the\n5:53\nassumptions are a little bit different.\n5:54\nWe are assuming more revenue growth uh\n5:57\nmargins are expanded and tighter\n5:59\ninventory management. So from that we\n6:02\ncan see that we have higher free cash\n6:03\nflows especially in our later years and\n6:05\ninstead of the present value of the free\n6:07\ncash flows decreasing they are now\n6:09\nincreasing with the each year pretty\n6:11\nsubstantially. So the upside case would\n6:13\nbe the most beneficial for us just from\n6:15\nwhat we've seen here.\n6:18\nNow to look at the worst case, which is\n6:19\nthe downside case. We're looking at\n6:21\nrevenue of only 3% um with margins that\n6:24\ncontract down to 13.5 with inefficient\n6:28\ninventory turnover with ties with tie\n6:31\nups in cash.\n6:34\nBut we can see here that the free cash\n6:36\nflow relatively stays around 525 and it\n6:39\ndoesn't tend to move up too much. Only\n6:41\ngoes up around 2 million. And then the\n6:43\npresent value of free cash flow is\n6:45\npretty much tanking which we don't\n6:47\nreally want to see. If anything, we'd\n6:48\nrather see it uh be discounted at a\n6:50\nbetter rate than that.\n6:53\nNow, before we move on to the next\n6:56\nsection, uh let's talk a little bit\n6:58\nabout what this means. So, the\n7:00\nenterprise value is what the whole\n7:02\nbusiness is worth before debt and cash.\n7:04\nAnd then the equity value is basically\n7:06\nwhat's left for the shareholders. Um\n7:10\nbut as far as the implied entry goes,\n7:12\nthe multiple for the earnings before\n7:14\nincome tax depreciation um basically\n7:16\nsays how much are we paying for $1 of\n7:20\nearnings before income and tax and\n7:22\ndepreciation. And then the percent value\n7:24\nfrom terminal basically that just means\n7:26\nthe percent of the valuation driven by\n7:28\nwhat we are assuming happens after the\n7:30\nlisted projection the listed projection\n7:33\nyears.\n7:35\nSo we can see that in these cases how\n7:37\nthose differ and in the upside case\n7:40\nthere would be more for the shareholders\n7:42\nand in the downside case there would be\n7:44\na lot less. Moving on let's look at our\n7:47\ncost of capital. So we have it at 9% but\n7:51\nwhy 9%. So the calculation blends the\n7:53\ncost of u the cost of equity with the uh\n7:55\nwith the debt um at a 25% debt ratio. So\n7:59\nunder that context, uh a 9% cost of\n8:02\ncapital properly reflects the premium\n8:04\nfor a sponsor owned asset versus the uh\n8:06\nlower public peers like McDonald's,\n8:08\nwhich would be around 7%.\n8:10\nWe can see that a 1% shift would swing\n8:13\nthe uh valuation in $1.5 billion in\n8:17\neither way. And then higher rates would\n8:19\nseverely cap the large buyout leverage\n8:21\ncapacity.\n8:23\nThat makes sense for me uh given the\n8:26\nbusiness that Panera is um and what they\n8:29\nhave to cover cost. But moving on, next\n8:32\nthing that I wanted to conclude was the\n8:34\nterminal value calculation. So I use\n8:36\ntwo. So I wanted to do a Gordon growth\n8:38\nmodel which is more of the academic and\n8:39\nthen the exit multiple which is the\n8:40\nmarket standard. So I did this\n8:42\ncomparison because it compares theory\n8:44\nwith the market pricing. So seeing under\n8:46\nour theory we would have a um lower DCF\n8:51\nvaluation than what we had in our exit\n8:53\nmultiple here by a huge amount.\n8:56\nThis is under the assumptions uh 2.5 uh\n9:00\n2.5% perceptual growth rate.\n9:04\nNow let's let's wrap up everything in\n9:06\nthis uh discounted cash flow model. Um\n9:09\nso we're looking at the scenario\n9:11\ncomparisons like we saw earlier. We can\n9:13\nsee the downside cases to the base case.\n9:16\nWe can see that to justify a bid above a\n9:19\num 13.5 billion floor, the private\n9:21\nequity group must really believe in the\n9:23\nupside execution of this. So the\n9:26\ndownside risk is beyond substantial and\n9:28\nif it stalls or really just stays in the\n9:30\nbase case, um there's not a whole lot\n9:32\ngoing for it. So I think um they must\n9:36\nbelieve in the upside execution given\n9:38\nthis and just from the uh discounted\n9:41\ncash flow model um it would support a\n9:43\n$15 billion valuation with a suggesting\n9:46\nbid of 14 billion. Uh this leaves a\n9:48\nlimited margin or margin for error\n9:50\nwithout strategic synergies.\n9:53\nSo now that we all now that we got the\n9:55\nnumber jargon out of the way, let's look\n9:57\nat the um comparisons and the uh\n10:00\npresidents.\n10:02\nSo, first uh let's find the set of peers\n10:04\nthat we're going to compare against. Uh\n10:07\nmy logic for this was we're going to\n10:09\nchoose Chipotle, Starbucks, and Shake\n10:11\nShack. Um we can see\n10:15\nwe can see how Chipotle and Panera are\n10:17\npretty similar in what they do um along\n10:19\nwith uh Starbucks and their customer\n10:22\nbehavior. And then uh Shake Shack really\n10:24\njust shows the uh high growth um that\n10:27\nPanera seems or wants to recapture. But\n10:30\nwe're going to exclude uh pizza places\n10:33\nand then also uh full service dining\n10:35\nrestaurants um because it can't really\n10:37\ncompare to Panera in the fast food\n10:39\nchain. So why this specific pier set? So\n10:42\nwe're looking at Chipotle which would be\n10:45\nour ceiling. Uh this sets the aspiration\n10:47\nand Panera wants to be valued at a\n10:48\ndigital mix not at store operations. Um\n10:51\nthe anchor is going to be our McDonald's\n10:54\nand our Q QSR. uh this is going to\n10:57\nprovide a valuation floor even as a\n10:59\nmature um holding co asset and uh from\n11:03\nwhat that says Panera shouldn't trade\n11:05\nbelow QSR which is at a 14 multiple our\n11:08\nproxy is going to be Shake Shack which\n11:10\njustifies the growth premium um as we\n11:12\nshowed earlier and if Panera executes\n11:15\nits 500 store plan um that deserves its\n11:17\nown partial growth multiple before we go\n11:20\nabout comparing these companies let's go\n11:22\nahead and make sure that a lot of this\n11:24\ndata is accurate\n11:26\nthis will be the verification part of\n11:28\nthe driver stage.\n11:30\nWe're going to verify QSR since a\n11:32\nmajority of these are already assumed in\n11:34\nthe data. When we look at QSR, we can\n11:36\nsee that they have a market cap of 32\n11:38\nbillion, which lines up with what we\n11:41\nhave here. And then the PE ratio um is a\n11:44\nlittle bit different, but it's still in\n11:45\nthe same ballpark. So, uh did a pretty\n11:48\ngood job on that part. And then um these\n11:51\nPE ratios are obviously assumed um\n11:53\nwithin here.\n11:55\nBut now let's uh let's compare. So for\n11:59\nthe recommendation that it's giving\n12:02\nthe Panera trading range should be in\n12:04\nbetween a 14 times and 20 times\n12:07\nmultiple. The rationale behind that is\n12:09\nwe position Panera at a premium um broad\n12:12\nto the QSR average which is basically\n12:14\nlike a ETF for restaurant brands. Um and\n12:18\nthen they discount to Chipotle. Um, so\n12:20\nwhile Panera matches Chipotle's digital\n12:23\nmix and its lower margins, its slower\n12:25\nunit growth would warrant a um 16 to 18\n12:29\ntimes anchor um which is right in the\n12:31\nmiddle here. But basically what it's\n12:33\nsaying is that it's not going to go\n12:34\nbelow um QSR and then\n12:38\nslower unit growth won't make it have um\n12:40\nas high of a multiple as Chipotle.\n12:45\nSo now that we have that rough range,\n12:47\nlet's go ahead and look into more of an\n12:48\nanalysis. This is going to be a\n12:50\nbenchmark for recent mergers and\n12:52\nacquisitions. So, we can see that Costa\n12:54\nCoffee got acquired by Coca-Cola in 2019\n12:57\nas a strategic buyer type uh with a EV\n13:00\nof 16,\n13:02\na decently high premium, but\n13:05\nwe can see how that multiple falls in\n13:08\nbetween our range as well, which is\n13:09\nalways good to see. Um, and the median\n13:11\nbetween here is 16, which is pretty much\n13:12\nright in between here. I'm not going to\n13:15\nwalk through all of these, but this\n13:17\ndefinitely gives a great visual. um for\n13:20\nuh the benchmarks in the recent mergers\n13:22\nand acquisitions within the restaurant\n13:24\nindustry. Um comparing these allows us\n13:26\nto see where\n13:28\nour merge and acquisition might sit if\n13:31\num\n13:32\nsorry not our merge and acquisition\n13:34\nwhere Panera might sit after.\n13:37\nSo now that we've s done some\n13:39\ncomparisons and seen some market mergers\n13:41\nand acquisitions, let's look at the\n13:43\nimplied valuation ranges. So why is 16\n13:47\nto 17 multiple the fair value zone?\n13:50\nWell, according to the tri\n13:51\ntriangularization, it sits precisely\n13:53\nbetween the QSR floor and the president\n13:56\nstrategic median. So that's perfect. Uh\n13:58\nit's growth adjusted. So the 16 multiple\n14:00\ncredits Panera for digital leadership\n14:02\nlike Starbucks, but penalizes it for\n14:04\nlower than Chipotle margins as we talked\n14:06\nabout earlier. Um and then the recent\n14:09\ntech enabled food assets have cleared\n14:10\nthat 17 time multiple. Anything less\n14:13\nthan that undervalues the the digital\n14:15\nstack.\n14:18\nBut shown from our two methods here,\n14:19\nit's always good to compare, as we said\n14:21\nearlier, our trading comps and president\n14:23\ndeals. We can see the uh differences in\n14:25\nthe ranges of the multiples, but they\n14:26\nare pretty similar with the median both\n14:28\nsitting at about 16 um with the uh\n14:31\npresident deals being a little bit\n14:32\nhigher.\n14:34\nBut that also is reassuring to see. And\n14:37\num that helps me reassure that 16 to 17\n14:40\nis our fair value zone for our multiple.\n14:45\nSo given our three valuation models or\n14:47\nthree valuation um takes on this all\n14:51\nthree methodologies converge tightly\n14:53\naround the $15 billion a little less\n14:56\nthan that range. Um this creates a\n14:58\nhighly defense defensible valuation\n15:00\nfloor. So our bid logic why 14 billion\n15:03\nthat's what we are set on between here.\n15:05\nWell, a balance for a 15.5 time multiple\n15:09\nbid um exceeds the typical sponsor cap\n15:11\nof 12 to 13 acknowledging Panera's\n15:13\nquality, but it's also staying below the\n15:15\n17 strategic winners curse. I did a\n15:17\nlittle bit of research about that.\n15:20\nUm kind of the the same here. Sorry, let\n15:23\nme restart that. Uh the same thing here\n15:25\nfor uh the upside with a 15.5 entry. Uh\n15:29\nthe private equity group retains room\n15:31\nfor an exit at 18 times via an IPO if\n15:34\nthey wanted to uh if they do the 500\n15:37\nshore rule out if that's successful. And\n15:40\nthen the defensive metric any bid below\n15:42\n14 risk immediate dismissal given that\n15:44\npublic peers trade at around 14 to 16.\n15:46\nSo it's a little bit risky but open\n15:48\nnegotiations are at 13.8 billion to test\n15:51\nprice sensitivity but they're going to\n15:53\nmaintain authorization to stretch to\n15:55\n14.2 to um given this recommendation\n15:58\nfrom AI.\n16:00\nNow, I think that what we have so far is\n16:03\nnot a bad idea at all from our different\n16:05\nmethodologies and I think giving us a\n16:08\nlittle bit of a cushion and going below\n16:10\nuh what we found here is a not a bad\n16:13\nidea at all because there is a lot of\n16:14\nstuff that needs to go right for uh this\n16:17\nprivate equity group to really make\n16:18\nmoney off Panera.\n16:20\nNow, for the third part of our analysis,\n16:22\nwe're going to look at the financial\n16:23\nversus strategic buyers. So let's go\n16:24\nahead and look at our arc types for\n16:26\nthose. So first for our financial buyer\n16:28\nwhich is KKR versus strategic which is\n16:30\ngoing to be McDonald's and Starbucks. So\n16:31\nfor the target returns financially\n16:34\nthey're going to look for around a 20 to\n16:36\n25% in um internal rate of return. This\n16:41\nis because it requires a disciplined\n16:42\nentry. As far as a leverage profile, um\n16:45\nit's going to be high for the U private\n16:47\nequity group and low for the strategic\n16:49\nbuyer. uh this is because it's high\n16:51\nbecause it's sensitive to the 9% cost of\n16:53\ndebt. And then the strategic buyer is\n16:55\nfunded via um cash or uh stock.\n17:00\nAs far as value creation goes, the\n17:01\nfinancial buyer is looking for\n17:03\noperational efficiency, deleveraging,\n17:05\nand multiple arbitrage on exit. And then\n17:08\nthe strategic buyer is really looking\n17:10\nfor hard synergies like how well is this\n17:12\ncompany going to integrate into ours? Um\n17:14\nlooking into the supply chain, GNA cuts\n17:17\nand tech stack integration. And as far\n17:19\nas the control premium grows or goes, um\n17:23\nthe financial buyer is going to look at\n17:24\nthe low end while the strategic buyer is\n17:26\ngoing to look at the high end. This is\n17:28\nbecause it's going to be limited by our\n17:29\ninternal rate of return model ceiling.\n17:31\nAnd then this is going to be justified\n17:33\nby the synergy which could help that\n17:35\ncompany get even more growth later on.\n17:39\nBut to kind of sum that up a little bit,\n17:42\num, as a analyst note,\n17:45\nlooking at this strategic premium, if\n17:47\nthe strategic side is paying an 18 time\n17:49\nmultiple, um, the private equity group\n17:51\ncannot mathematically clear that bridge.\n17:53\nSo that's kind of neat to see these arc\n17:55\ntypes. But now, let's go look into what\n17:57\nis actually going on. So this is\n17:59\nquantifying our potential synergies on\n18:02\nthe strategic side because that's really\n18:04\nonly where synergy applies to. So what\n18:07\nthis so what this visualization shows is\n18:10\na synergy bridge. So basically what this\n18:12\nis is what the value is added to uh that\n18:16\ncompany. But what this is saying is they\n18:20\ncould headline this multiple at 16 while\n18:22\nowning the business at 13. So they would\n18:25\ncreate a three times multiple advantage\n18:27\nover their financial buyers. So this\n18:29\nkind of plays into how a strategic buyer\n18:32\ncan outbid rationally a financial buyer\n18:36\nbecause synergies um play a huge part in\n18:38\nthat.\n18:39\nBut as far as some of the assumptions\n18:41\nfor how we got these numbers uh the\n18:43\nsupply chain we can see that immediate\n18:44\nCOG savings from consolidating the\n18:46\npurchasing power across a larger\n18:48\nfootprint. Uh the GNA and HQ um\n18:50\nelimination of public company cost and\n18:52\nredundant HQ functions. um the the tech\n18:57\nand uh the digital side is going to\n18:58\nmigrate Panera's um user base to a\n19:01\nshared app infrastructure and reduce cap\n19:03\nuh maintenance capex and also boost data\n19:07\nmonetization.\n19:10\nNext, let's look at the large buyout\n19:12\nmath. This is for the financial buyer\n19:15\nview. So, as said earlier, the private\n19:17\nequity group would face a mathematical\n19:19\nceiling. So assuming the 5-year hold of\n19:22\n5.5 times leverage and an exit of 14.5\n19:25\num times uh returns rapidly degrade\n19:30\nabove a 14 times entry as we see here.\n19:33\nSo on the conservative side if we went\n19:35\nwith this entry we would have an\n19:38\ninternal rate of return of about 20%.\n19:40\nBut from what we saw up here if the\n19:43\nstrategic buyers wanted to buy we would\n19:45\nhave to push our entry to all the way to\n19:47\n14.4 4 billion, which would decrease our\n19:50\nintern to rate of return by a lot.\n19:54\nBut what this is actually showing is\n19:55\nthat it caps KKR's bid um at 14x. Beyond\n19:59\nthis, the\n20:01\nuh return drops below the required\n20:03\nthreshold given the uh cost of debt\n20:05\nenvironment. And then as far as the\n20:07\nleverage uh constraint, even with max\n20:09\nleverage, the interest burden uh limits\n20:11\nequity value creation unless exit\n20:12\nmultiples expand significantly, which is\n20:15\na very risky bet. So, so far it's pretty\n20:18\nfavoring the strategic side um instead\n20:20\nof the private equity group, the\n20:21\nfinancial side. But now, let's do some\n20:23\nrisk and rollover comparisons. So, as\n20:26\nwhen we're looking at the KKR\n20:28\nrequirement, they need a 10 to 20%\n20:30\nrollover. So, they need the management\n20:32\nto bleed with them and high alignment\n20:34\nensures execution with the 500 store\n20:36\nrollout. That's really what they need to\n20:37\nmake good money off this. As far as the\n20:41\nstrategic requirement, there really\n20:42\nisn't none because they're buying the\n20:44\nbrand, not the team. and uh the cash out\n20:47\ncreates immediate liquidity for the\n20:48\nfounders. As far as the risk goes, uh\n20:51\nthe financial side there is heavy\n20:53\nleverage that leaves no room for error.\n20:54\nSo if margins contract the um it can go\n20:58\nbad from there. the strategic side. Um\n21:01\nit's a bit of a culture clash and a\n21:02\nbrand dilutation um diludation\n21:06\num migrating Panera's tech stack to a\n21:09\nlarger legacy platform could stall\n21:11\ngrowth and people just might feel kind\n21:13\nof weird about um Starbucks or\n21:14\nMcDonald's taking over Panera because it\n21:17\nis such a huge company. But to summarize\n21:19\nour buyer perspectives before we provide\n21:22\nour final recommendation, the financial\n21:24\nbuyer um it's really just bound by math.\n21:27\nThat's the hard part. uh we talked about\n21:29\nall of these already. And then as far as\n21:31\nthe strategic buyer, um the synergy is\n21:33\nreally the best rationale for why they\n21:35\nshould go about it. When we're looking\n21:38\nat the deal dynamics, we can see that\n21:40\nthe valuation gap um the strategics\n21:42\nenjoy a three time multiple advantage\n21:44\ndue to hard synergies allowing them to\n21:46\npay a 17 time multiple while effectively\n21:48\nowning it at 13 times.\n21:51\nUm, as far as the spread goes, um, KKR's\n21:54\nabsolute ceiling is going to be at 13.5,\n21:56\nwhich sits well below the strategic\n21:57\nfloor of 16 that we found earlier. So,\n22:00\nit kind of makes it unwinable at that\n22:01\nprice. Uh, the strategic buyers should\n22:04\nbe winning this. Um, as far as a\n22:06\nnegotiation strategy, we'll get a little\n22:08\nbit more into that later, but KKR must\n22:10\nposition itself as a friendly option\n22:11\nthat protects the brand identity and\n22:13\nmanagement autonomy, betting that\n22:14\nantitrust and integration fears sideline\n22:16\nthe strategic biders. So, that's really\n22:18\nthe best case for that.\n22:22\nBut um before we get into our actual\n22:24\nrecommendation, here's a little draft.\n22:27\nWell, the key structural disadvantage\n22:31\nthat we just talked about is they can't\n22:32\nwin in a price war. Um so their walkway\n22:35\nnumber would be at a 14.2 billion, but\n22:37\nour winning narrative for our uh\n22:40\nnegotiation would probably be something\n22:42\nlike this.\n22:45\nSo KKR must pivot the conversation from\n22:47\nthe headline price to the future value\n22:48\nand autonomy of the company.\n22:52\nThey need to move fast and offer deal\n22:54\ncertainty. Um so before the strategics\n22:58\ncan finish antirrust.\n23:00\nUm they need to sell the soft factors.\n23:02\nSo pitch management on avoiding the\n23:03\ncorporate bear hug of McDonald's and\n23:05\nthey are going to swear to keep their\n23:07\nculture intact like we talked about\n23:08\nearlier.\n23:10\nAnd then the second bite shows that\n23:12\nmanagement um shows that shows\n23:15\nmanagement that a 20% rollover in a\n23:17\nprivate equity deal could be worth more\n23:19\nin five years than the extra cash\n23:21\nupfront from the strategic. So let's go\n23:25\nahead and provide our final\n23:26\nrecommendation. So from what we found\n23:28\nearlier, we saw that our\n23:32\nso we can see that the LBO would sit\n23:33\naround here um starting at like the 13\n23:36\nside that we talked about earlier but\n23:40\nthe fair value zone is shown here. So\n23:42\nthe trading competitors or the president\n23:44\ntransactions um that we talked about\n23:46\nearlier um play in here and then we also\n23:50\nsee how the dollar cost average uh plays\n23:53\nin here as well. So these three\n23:55\nmethodologies would be rational to um\n23:58\nexecute it in the fair value zone. But\n24:00\nthe LBO analysis that we did would not.\n24:07\nSo how how could we win over this bid?\n24:09\nWell, this is what we would recommend.\n24:11\nSo first we would start by opening the\n24:13\nbid at 13.5 billion. This clears the low\n24:15\nball threshold while preserving a 22%\n24:18\nIRR. Um this is positioned as a serious\n24:21\nserious financial offer that allows for\n24:22\nnegotiation. If you're putting up 13.5\n24:25\nbillion um up for a company, it shows\n24:27\nthat you're no joke. And this allows for\n24:29\nsome cushioning room. But our best and\n24:32\nfinal offer um that we would take is 14\n24:35\nflat. So this is the maximum we can pay\n24:38\nto maintain the 20% IRR. This matches\n24:40\nthe low end of our trading comps and\n24:41\nmakes it defensible to the board.\n24:43\nObviously um this might be a little bit\n24:45\nhard to get compared to the strategic\n24:47\nside, but that being said, our complete\n24:50\nwalkway price uh would be at 14.2. two.\n24:53\nSo this falls below 18% and leverage um\n24:57\nexceeds the covenant capacity. So\n25:01\nit's impossible to price for perfect\n25:03\nexecution in that macro environment.\n25:06\nSo we're sitting at between 13.5 and 14\n25:09\nbillion. Um as far as our uh negotiation\n25:13\ntalking points, we're going to make sure\n25:15\nto bring up um certainty versus\n25:19\nregulatory.\n25:20\nUh so first I would bring up that we are\n25:22\nfully financed and close in 45 days. The\n25:25\nstrategic offer um at 16 billion brings\n25:28\n6 months of antitrust scrutiny. Julie\n25:30\nwant a number on paper or cash in the\n25:32\nbank. So that's a great negotiation\n25:34\ntalking point that would make the\n25:36\nshareholders or um whoever we're buying\n25:38\nthis from think about it a little bit\n25:39\nlonger.\n25:41\nWe would talk about the cash versus\n25:42\nwealth creation. So a strategic exit is\n25:44\na taxable event. rolling 20% equity with\n25:47\nus gives you a second bite at the apple\n25:50\npotentially worth 2.5 more in five\n25:51\nyears. So that's also very attractive.\n25:54\nUm our discipline valuation, so our 14\n25:57\nbillion bid is not a discount. It's a\n25:59\nfair market value based on our current\n26:00\nopera our operations and our analysis\n26:03\nthat we just did. So we're paying for\n26:04\nwhat exists, not the theoretical\n26:05\nsynergies that the strategic side sees.\n26:08\nUh the margin of safety with uh rates at\n26:10\n5% paying a 17 time multiple is capital\n26:13\ndestruction. So we are writing a $9\n26:15\nbillion equity check that require a\n26:16\nmargin of safety. Basically just saying\n26:19\nwe're putting n billion of our dollars\n26:20\nat risk. So we need some sort of safety.\n26:25\nThis se this section just simply shows\n26:27\nhow the uh buyout would be paid for. So\n26:30\nabout um the target leverage is about 5\n26:32\nbillion and the equity check would be\n26:34\n9.2 billion. So it's about 35% debt and\n26:37\n65% equity.\n26:39\nBut let's wrap it all up. This is my um\n26:43\nthis is my executive ready um investment\n26:46\ncommittee recommendation.\n26:49\nSo through our triangul triang\n26:51\ntriangularization um across discounted\n26:53\ncash flow trading comps presidents and\n26:56\nlarge buyout math points to a\n26:57\nfundamental range of 14.5 to 5 billion.\n27:00\nHowever, given today's 9% cost of debt\n27:02\nand our high teens IRRa requirement, we\n27:05\nsee a sponsor economic value zone of\n27:07\n13.5 billion to 14.2 2 billion with a 15\n27:11\nto 15.8 times multiple um earnings\n27:15\nbefore income tax depreciation.\n27:19\nSo what do we do? We recommend an\n27:21\nopening bid of 13.5 billion with an\n27:23\nauthorization to stretch our best and\n27:25\nfinal to 145 billion with a hard walk\n27:27\naway at 14.2 billion.\n27:30\nSorry about that. Um below 14 billion we\n27:34\nare testing our seller urgency and\n27:36\nanchoring negotiations.\n27:39\num in the 14 to 14.2 billion ban is\n27:42\nwhere we can still underwrite attractive\n27:44\nreturns without assuming strategic\n27:46\nsynergies but above 14.2 billion IRR\n27:50\nfalls below our acceptable band and we\n27:51\nare effectively paying for the strategic\n27:53\nprice with the financial buyer risk so\n27:55\nwe should only proceed if we can win on\n27:57\nspeed deal certainty and management\n27:59\nrollover not by matching a $16 billion\n28:02\nheadline from McDonald's or Starbucks.\n28:06\nSo that is what our analysis concludes.\n28:08\nI think that makes a lot of sense uh\n28:09\ncomparing the financial and strategic\n28:11\nbuyers and I think that this would be a\n28:14\ngood plan to go about and\n28:17\nsure it might have a little bit lower\n28:18\nodds of happening since the synergy gap\n28:20\nis so high but if it does happen based\n28:23\non speed certainty and management\n28:24\nrollover it could definitely be\n28:26\nbeneficial.\n28:29\nSo to wrap it all up I wanted to go\n28:31\nthrough the reflection part. I have uh\n28:32\nthree questions that I wanted to answer.\n28:34\nSo, first, what is our biggest takeaway\n28:36\num from this assignment? My biggest\n28:38\ntakeaway was really just dipping my toes\n28:40\ninto this type of environment. Um I\n28:43\ndon't think I've ever done this\n28:46\nbig of a valuation or an analysis before\n28:49\nfor um a company like this. So,\n28:51\ndefinitely some good practice and some\n28:52\ngood experience. Um and uh yeah. Uh\n28:56\nsecondly, what did we learn? Well, I\n28:59\ndefinitely got a\n29:01\nuh more of a taste into the private\n29:02\nequity world and I learned more about\n29:05\nfinancial and strategic buyers. I didn't\n29:07\nreally take that into account before, so\n29:08\nit was really cool to learn about that.\n29:11\nUm, and then also just all the different\n29:13\nvaluation models that I learned. Um,\n29:15\nyeah, it was pretty cool to use all of\n29:18\nthose. But, and then I wanted to answer,\n29:20\nis this applicable to future positions?\n29:23\nAnd I would say definitely. Uh I have an\n29:25\ninternship coming up in this summer and\n29:27\nit's for an investment analyst position.\n29:28\nSo I think building these skills will be\n29:31\nvery helpful. Um if I can continue to\n29:33\nuse AI in this way um and continue to\n29:36\nverify it, I think that will be super\n29:38\nhelpful. So uh that is my assignment 12."
