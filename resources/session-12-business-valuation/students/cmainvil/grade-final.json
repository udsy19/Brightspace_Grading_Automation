  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the present value of future free cash flows, implements multi‑scenario projections and discounting, and computes/justifies a blended cost of capital (WACC) with sensitivity and terminal value methods. The discussion is detailed and applied (scenarios, WACC, Gordon vs exit multiple), meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly performed terminal value calculations using both the Gordon growth model and an exit multiple (with a specified 2.5% growth assumption) and compared results. They also explained what \"percent value from terminal\" means and noted the large impact of terminal assumptions on valuation, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound treatment of the terminal value concept.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separated a five-year forecast period from terminal valuation, provided concrete short-term growth scenarios (8% base, higher upside, 3% downside) and used a defensible long-term perpetual growth rate (2.5%) alongside an exit-multiple approach. These specific assumptions, scenario analysis, and discussion of terminal contribution show a thorough, well-justified multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references EBITDA-related figures and working-capital assumptions and discusses free cash flow within a DCF (Implement evidence), and links FCF-driven DCF to enterprise value (implying FCF informs value to all capital providers). However, treatment is incomplete: NOPAT/tax adjustments are not clearly stated, depreciation/CapEx are only implied (CapEx mentioned tangentially), and the student never explicitly defines FCF as cash available to all providers—so understanding is present but not thoroughly or systematically demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the EV vs. equity concept and applies it in buyout math (showing debt of ~$5B and an equity check ~$9.2B), indicating they understand subtracting debt to arrive at equity. However, they do not explicitly show the EV − Net Debt arithmetic step nor any division by share count to derive a Price Per Share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed verification checks against peer metrics and used external tools to refine outputs, demonstrating intent and some external validation (Validate + Implement stages). However, they did not name specific external data sources or sites (e.g., Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, SEC, specific calculators), so the validation is general rather than source-specific, meeting the PARTIAL standard.",
