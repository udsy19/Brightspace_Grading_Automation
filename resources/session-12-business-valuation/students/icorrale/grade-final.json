  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models free cash flows, constructs a DCF/terminal value framework, and applies a 9% WACC to discount results, demonstrating correct and substantive use of DCF methodology. They further present scenario/sensitivity analysis and triangulate with market methods, showing a thorough introductory-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes a terminal value using an exit multiple with concrete numbers (13.5x → $23.8B) and applies discounting (9% WACC). They also highlight that valuation is most sensitive to the exit multiple, effectively acknowledging that terminal/exit assumptions drive the bulk of value. This meets the criterion thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulates DCF, trading comparables, and precedent transactions, provides multiple numeric anchors (exit multiple range, selected mid-point), and discusses which valuations are more/less reasonable and key sensitivities. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually grounded treatment meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses and reports free cash flow in a DCF (implementation evidence) and applies it to enterprise valuation (implying FCF-to-firm use), but they do not explicitly break out or name the FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, ΔWorking Capital) nor plainly state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers. This shows correct conceptual use but incomplete, surface-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (five-year operating forecast) and a terminal valuation method (exit multiple) and applies reasonable terminal assumptions (13.5x). However, they provide only limited discussion of multi-stage growth dynamics (e.g., no explicit rationale showing higher short-term vs lower long-term growth rates or a detailed terminal/perpetual growth rate), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise value ranges and an equity value (8.8B), demonstrating correct directional understanding of the EV→Equity bridge. However, they do not explicitly show subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value nor dividing equity value by share count to produce a price per share, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
