  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies DCF as the intrinsic (present) value of projected free cash flows and states/uses a WACC (9%) as the discount rate, with implementation in code and a sensitivity table — demonstrating a thorough, applied introductory understanding. These substantive descriptions and applied steps across Represent/Implement/Evolve meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies key FCF components (taxes, interest, depreciation/amortization, CapEx, and working capital) and documents how they back into missing items and use a FCF conversion rate. They also use those FCFs discounted to enterprise value (via WACC) — demonstrating understanding that the DCF/FCF approach values the firm (cash available to providers of capital). These show a thorough, applied conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes terminal value calculations using both the exit-multiple and Gordon growth methods and averages them (explicitly stated and implemented), demonstrating correct application. They also discuss the relative impact and methodological differences (noting Gordon growth underestimates and averaging to mitigate), showing awareness of the terminal value's importance in the DCF—satisfying the criterion at a thorough, conceptual level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculates and reports an enterprise value and a recommended purchase price but never subtracts net debt or converts EV to equity value nor divides by share count to derive a price per share. Implement and Reflect stages show valuation work and deal context, but the specific EV→Equity→Price‑per‑share bridge required by the criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used WACC as the discount rate for enterprise (FCFF) cash flows and included sensitivity analysis around the 9% WACC. However, they did not calculate or justify the 9% (no debt/equity components, betas, or industry derivation), so the application is correct but lacks a defensible derivation — hence PARTIAL.",
