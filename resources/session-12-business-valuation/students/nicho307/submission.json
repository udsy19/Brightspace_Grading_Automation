  "transcript": "0:05\nHi, I'm Addison Nichols. This is my\n0:07\nsession 12 assignment. So, beginning\n0:09\nwith the define and discover portion,\n0:11\nour goal for this assignment is to\n0:13\ndetermine a winning informed bid range\n0:15\nfor KKR to take over Panera while also\n0:18\ngoing against other strategic biders. So\n0:22\nour success criteria for this is that we\n0:24\nwant this bid range to be supported by\n0:26\ndiscounted cash flow, trading comps and\n0:29\nprecedent transactions. So some\n0:31\nbackground about Panera is that they\n0:33\nhave 900 million in earnings before\n0:35\ninterest, tax, depreciation, and\n0:37\namortization, which is essentially their\n0:39\noperating profit. And so this is 15% of\n0:42\ntheir total revenue, which is 6 billion.\n0:45\nSo for every $1 made, this means that\n0:47\nPanera keeps 15 cents as operating\n0:50\nprofit. They are expected to grow at\n0:52\nabout 8% per year. They have 2,100\n0:55\nstores with 400 million net income and\n0:57\ndigital sales are about 50%. So the\n1:00\nfuture plans, so this is what happened\n1:01\npost takeover, is that they want to have\n1:04\n500 new stores in 5 years, digital mixed\n1:06\nto 70%, an international roll out in a\n1:09\ndiner or dinner and catering expansion.\n1:12\nLooking at the market, competitors\n1:14\ncurrently trade at 22 times the price to\n1:16\nearnings ratio, 12 to 15 times the\n1:18\noperating profit precedent. Um, and then\n1:23\nChipotle currently trades at 35 times\n1:25\nthe price to earnings ratio and\n1:27\nMcDonald's does at 25 times that. And\n1:30\nour weighted average cost to capital is\n1:31\n9%.\n1:33\nSo, moving on to the represent portion.\n1:35\nBasically, our game plan for this, the\n1:38\ndiscounted cash flow is our intrinsic\n1:39\nvalue based on 5-year projections. So,\n1:41\nwe're looking at a 5-year horizon for\n1:43\nthis. What we're going to do for this,\n1:45\nit's going to be mostly contained in the\n1:47\ncode, but is to calculate the 5-year\n1:49\nfree cash flow and terminal value with\n1:51\nexit multiples and Gordon growth. We're\n1:53\ngoing to average those two methods for\n1:54\nthe value used. What I found when I was\n1:57\ntrying to approach this was that I felt\n1:58\nthe Gordon growth underestimated it\n2:00\ncompared to what I thought it should be.\n2:02\nSo, by averaging these, it's kind of\n2:04\nmitigating the fact that, you know,\n2:05\nthere's two ways to calculate it and\n2:07\nthey do have their own respective\n2:08\nanswers. Something I also noticed as is\n2:11\nthat we're not provided depreciation,\n2:14\namortization, interest, capital\n2:16\nexpenses, or net\n2:19\nor um the net working capital. Um so we\n2:23\ndo know that we have 900 million\n2:26\num of the operating profit and 400\n2:28\nmillion net income. So we know 500\n2:30\nmillion of that goes towards taxes,\n2:32\ninterest, and depreciation,\n2:33\namortization. So I did use Gemini to\n2:36\nhelp me kind of back into this and how\n2:37\nto approach this. So we're going to use\n2:39\na conversion rate to simplify this. So\n2:42\n50 to 60% of the operating profit is\n2:45\ntypical for mature restaurant chains. So\n2:47\nlet's assume interest is 100 million\n2:49\nwhich is pretty standard. And then\n2:51\ndepreciation, amortization, and capital\n2:54\nexpenses are respectively 200 million of\n2:57\nthat 500 million gap. So that all adds\n3:00\nup. So then we're going to use a free\n3:02\ncash flow conversion rate of 55%. Which\n3:05\nassumes the tax is 25% of the expenses\n3:09\nbefore interest in tax and that capital\n3:11\nexpenses are 5% of revenue and net\n3:16\nworking capital is 5% of revenue growth\n3:19\ngrowth sorry. So um trading comps are\n3:23\nbasically the relative value based on\n3:24\npeers. Um, using the operating profit,\n3:28\n900 million x 12 is our lower bound,\n3:31\nwhich would give us 10.8 billion. Our\n3:33\nupper bound for that is going to be the\n3:35\n900 million * 15, which ends up being\n3:37\n13.5\n3:39\nbillion. Um, using the price to earnings\n3:42\nratio, we see that it's about 22 um is\n3:47\nthe how the competitors trade. So based\n3:49\non that, we would be at 8.8 billion\n3:52\nbecause we use the net income for that.\n3:55\nAnd then looking at how Chipotle trades\n3:57\num they do that with the price to\n4:00\nearnings ratio times 35. So with the\n4:02\nsame value it would be 14 billion. So\n4:04\nthen also the president transactions are\n4:06\nrelative value based on based on past\n4:08\nsales of similar companies. So those are\n4:10\nthe three methods we're using to find\n4:11\nour range. And then what we're going to\n4:13\ndo with those is use the football field\n4:15\nto find the overlap between these three\n4:17\nmethods and thus find the best range for\n4:19\nthe bid. So implementing that we go to\n4:22\nPython in collab. So, what this first\n4:25\ncell does, it's basically the define and\n4:27\ndiscover portion. We're laying out\n4:28\neverything that we're given. Our assumed\n4:30\ntax rate, um our terminal growth rate,\n4:33\num current revenue, current operating\n4:36\nprofit, current net income, their\n4:38\nexpected growth. We're just laying all\n4:39\nthose out. Um and then moving down to\n4:43\nthe other part, we're going to use the\n4:45\nfree cash flow. So, again, I mentioned\n4:47\nthat conversion rate. Um we're going to\n4:49\nuse that to kind of calculate what's\n4:52\nimplied with what we're given. because\n4:55\nthe networking capital and the capital\n4:57\nexpenses are necessary to find the free\n5:00\ncash flow. So we just kind of have to\n5:02\nyou know use that logic to back into it\n5:04\nlike I explained earlier. So that's\n5:07\ngoing to discount all the cash flows.\n5:09\nIt's going to find the terminal value\n5:10\nusing exit multiple and Gordon growth\n5:12\nand average two for the blended\n5:14\nenterprise value and then run that in\n5:16\nthe base case. Um so what we see is that\n5:20\nour projected year 5 revenue is about\n5:22\n8.8 8 billion. Um, and our implied\n5:25\nenterprise value is about 11.9 billion.\n5:28\nAnd so we kind of see this projection\n5:30\ntable which shows us our revenue and\n5:32\nkind of just the cash flows. So that's\n5:35\njust laying out this basic kind of\n5:37\nvalues. This next cell we will get to\n5:40\nfor the evolve portion. Um, but then\n5:43\nafter that we're going to find the\n5:45\ncomparables and precedents. So we're\n5:48\ngoing to use the industry, the\n5:49\nMcDonald's, and the Chipotle. um price\n5:52\nto expense ratios that they usually bid\n5:54\nat, calculate the value from that. Um\n5:58\nand look at just precedent transactions\n6:00\nand also how financial and strategic\n6:03\nbuyers differ. Um but basically our\n6:06\noutput is going to be that our trading\n6:09\ncomps are 8.8 billion to 14 billion.\n6:12\nPrecedent transactions are 10.8 billion\n6:15\nto 13.5 billion. Our financial buyer\n6:19\nwith the discounted cash flow base is\n6:21\nbasically what we calculated and this\n6:23\nfirst one is implied enterprise value.\n6:24\nIt's about 11.9 billion. And then our\n6:27\nstrategic buyer with um synergy is going\n6:30\nto be 13 billion. So how we did this for\n6:33\nthe synergy values, we use some pretty\n6:36\nstandard um basically because when they\n6:39\nhave synergy they can kind of use their\n6:41\nown operations in tandem with the one\n6:43\nthey're acquiring cuz they're in a\n6:44\nsimilar business. they can kind of um\n6:48\nsave on costs because like supply chain\n6:50\nand headquarters, those can be merged\n6:52\nand then they can also cross sell. So I\n6:55\ndo have this little table that kind of\n6:57\ngoes over the differences between\n6:58\nfinancial buyers and strategic buyers.\n7:01\nSo we're more concerned as a financial\n7:03\nbuyer on the internal rate of return and\n7:05\nour cash on cash return. Our valuation\n7:07\nceiling is again 13.5 billion and some\n7:11\nadvantages that we have is the speed\n7:14\nmanagement will roll over. We won't\n7:16\nchange their management at all. But our\n7:18\nkey risk is that overpaying might\n7:20\ndestroy the internal rate of return if\n7:23\nsome of our assumptions end up being\n7:25\ndifferent. But for a strategic buyer,\n7:26\ntheir main risk is that they might not\n7:28\nintegrate well and there will be a\n7:30\nculture clash because this synergy\n7:33\nessentially allows them to combine in a\n7:35\nsense like their headquarters, some of\n7:37\ntheir operations because they're in this\n7:38\nsimilar business. That's how they save\n7:40\nthe money and have a higher valuation\n7:42\nceiling.\n7:44\nSo then again, that's why we see\n7:46\ndifferent valuation ranges for Synergy\n7:48\nversus our KKR company. So moving on,\n7:52\nit's going to combine all these ranges\n7:54\nthat we found into a football field\n7:56\nchart. So what we see is that we have a\n7:59\nlow of 8.8 billion for trading comps and\n8:01\na high of 14 billion. But then our low\n8:06\nfor precedence is 10.8 billion with a\n8:08\nhigh of 13.5 billion. For discounted\n8:11\ncash flows, our base is 10.7 billion\n8:13\nwith a ceiling of 13.1 billion. And then\n8:16\nstrategic has a base or a low of 11.7\n8:20\nbillion and a high of 14.3 billion. So\n8:23\nwhat we find that falls within all these\n8:25\nranges kind of towards the middle middle\n8:28\nis 12.5 billion.\n8:31\nto get to that range for our DCF because\n8:34\nagain we calculated the enterprise value\n8:36\nas um 11.9 billion we kind of just you\n8:41\nsee in this code that we have it go a\n8:44\nlittle bit lower so 90% and then a\n8:46\nlittle bit higher 110% of that um just\n8:50\nbecause that gives us room for bidding\n8:53\nwe're not going to get the exact\n8:54\nenterprise value so that's kind of where\n8:57\nwe see the recommended bid falling at\n8:59\nabout 12.5 5 billion. So then moving on\n9:02\nto the validate, an independent sanity\n9:04\ncheck is the math by hand from the\n9:06\nrepresent portion compared to the\n9:07\nfootball field graph. So what I did was\n9:10\ncalculate the minimum by um some of the\n9:14\nstandard price to expense ratio or\n9:18\nearnings to expense ratio, sorry, price\n9:21\nto earnings ratio.\n9:24\nAnd we see a lower bound of 8.8 billion\n9:27\nwhich shows up down here at the trading\n9:29\ncomparisons. And then we do see a\n9:30\nceiling of 14 billion which we take from\n9:33\nChipotle's trading. Um our precedence\n9:37\nwith the um using the operating profit\n9:43\nwe see 13.5 billion um as our ceiling\n9:46\nand that's what we calculated in there\n9:47\nand it's just similar thing to validate\n9:50\nthe discounted cash flows. What I did\n9:52\nwas just an estimate um just because the\n9:55\ncode is going to be better at doing it\n9:56\nthan me with all the nuances. So our\n9:59\nyear 1 of that we grow at 8% we get 972\n10:04\nmillion. Um then we find the year five\n10:06\nand finally terminal value which is this\n10:10\num\n10:12\nwhat we use to multiply the price to\n10:14\nearnings ratio times the final operating\n10:19\nprofit. um find the present value of the\n10:22\nterminal value and then approximate the\n10:25\npresent value of the 5-year cash flows\n10:27\nand we estimate it to be about 14\n10:29\nbillion which is in the ballpark of how\n10:32\nwe find this to be. It's pretty close to\n10:36\n13 billion. Um obviously this is an\n10:38\nestimate but it's in the ballpark. It's\n10:40\nnot abnormally different.\n10:42\nSo that's how we validate it. And then\n10:44\nmoving on to the evolve portion. What I\n10:47\ndid for this was the sensitivity table.\n10:49\nSo obviously what we predict in the\n10:52\nmarket isn't always going to be true. So\n10:54\nlooking at different combinations of the\n10:57\nweighted average cost of capital and the\n10:58\nactual growth of Panera. So in this\n11:01\nwe're saying that the weighted average\n11:02\ncost of capital that we defined here is\n11:04\n9%. And we predict Panera to have 8%\n11:08\ngrowth per year. But obviously that's\n11:10\nnot 100% going to be the case. So using\n11:12\nthis valuation table we can see at\n11:15\ndifferent combinations from 7 to 11%\n11:17\nweighted average cost of capital and 6\n11:19\nto 10% growth. Um so that will give us\n11:22\nlike a worst case scenario which is\n11:24\ngoing to be this bottom left corner with\n11:26\nthe highest weighted average cost\n11:27\ncapital and the lowest growth which\n11:29\nwould value it at about 9.3 billion. And\n11:32\nthen the best case scenario which is\n11:34\nthis top right with high growth and low\n11:36\nweighted average cost capital um being\n11:38\nat 16 billion. So this also kind of\n11:41\nhelps define our range as well for the\n11:43\nbidding. Um it gives us some leeway\n11:45\nbetween the possible scenarios too\n11:47\ninstead of just going off of one\n11:49\nassumption. And something that this also\n11:52\ndoes is give us negotiation leverage. So\n11:55\nif we obviously have low growth that\n11:58\nreally hurts the um value of the\n12:02\nenterprise. So what you can do when\n12:05\nyou're negotiating is say you have to\n12:06\nguarantee this amount of growth um in\n12:08\norder for us to bid this much because it\n12:10\nis a risk that you're taking on. Um and\n12:14\nso that's just something that can be\n12:15\nused as negotiation leverage. So moving\n12:18\non to the reflect portion, the valuation\n12:21\nrange for our bid has a floor of 10.8\n12:23\nbillion and a ceiling of 14.5 billion.\n12:26\nOur fair value that we calculate is\n12:28\nabout 13.5 billion. Um, this just comes\n12:32\nfrom,\n12:34\nyou know, the middle of the range. Um,\n12:36\nwhat falls between this like football\n12:38\nfield graph, what's in the middle and\n12:40\nwhat would be accepted pretty much. Um,\n12:44\nbut my final recommendation is to open\n12:46\nthe bid at 12.5 billion. That offers\n12:50\nabove the floor, but it also leaves room\n12:52\nfor negotiation. And so if they do want\n12:54\nhigher, you know, you always want to\n12:55\nkind of set it lower because you don't\n12:58\nwant to offer more than you think\n13:00\nthey'll actually ask for. Um, again, you\n13:03\njust want to keep it. Obviously, you\n13:04\nwant to acquire them for less because\n13:06\nthat would be better for your business.\n13:08\nUm, because KKR cannot pay for synergies\n13:11\nit does not have. Um, strategic buyers\n13:15\nlike McDonald's may be able to pay more\n13:16\nthan our ceiling, which we see in this\n13:18\ngraph. Their ceiling is 14 billion\n13:21\ncompared to ours. Um, but this would\n13:23\nresult in something like a merge of\n13:25\noperations, which is what enables them\n13:27\nto save that money to then put into the\n13:29\nacquiring. If we pitch KKR as a\n13:32\nmanagement friendly option that allows\n13:34\nthe current team to continue overseeing\n13:36\ngrowth instead of just this monetary\n13:39\nquantitative value once off, it offers\n13:42\nthis qualitative value. um this may give\n13:45\nmore of a mental rather than monetary\n13:47\nadvantage and is just a strategy to\n13:49\napproach um the negotiations and\n13:52\nsomething to bring to the table.\n13:54\nRegarding reflection, this is definitely\n13:57\na lot more complex of a topic than I\n13:59\nthought. I hadn't really considered\n14:01\nsynergies because looking at previous\n14:04\nmergers, I mean, one out there right now\n14:06\nis believe it's Paramount and Netflix.\n14:10\num that kind of thing or sorry it's\n14:12\nWarner Brothers and Netflix. Um it's\n14:15\nkind of interesting to see what goes\n14:17\ninto this and that kind of synergy\n14:19\nbecause that's an example that has\n14:21\nsynergy. They could merge through\n14:22\nstreaming platforms. Um so it's just\n14:25\ninteresting to look at this while these\n14:26\nkinds of things are happening and also\n14:28\njust how the government regulates them\n14:30\nto prevent things like monopolies. Um I\n14:33\njust thought this was an interesting\n14:35\nassignment to look at for that. Thank\n14:36you."
