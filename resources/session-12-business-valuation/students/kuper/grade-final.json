  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states they implemented a \"discounted free cash flow projection\" with terminal value and used WACC/sensitivity analysis to show value changes from varying discount rates. This demonstrates correct conceptual use of DCF (present-value FCFs) and application of WACC, with scenario and sensitivity work sufficient for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly separates a 5-year explicit forecast and a terminal value, uses explicit short-term growth assumptions (e.g., 8% base, 10% upside) and lower terminal growth sensitivities (1–3%), and runs scenario/sensitivity analysis to show effects. These elements demonstrate a thorough, well-grounded multi-stage growth reasoning consistent with the DRIVER stages, so PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used a DCF/discounted free cash flow framework and identified an industry WACC (9%) as the capital assumption, then ran sensitivity tests (9%→10%) showing valuation effects. This demonstrates both use of WACC as the discount rate for FCFF and a defensible WACC choice with supporting sensitivity analysis, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a working use of DCF and free cash flow modeling (implementation and use of EBITDA and multi-year FCF outputs) but does not explicitly identify core FCF components (NOPAT/EBIT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. This supports a correct but incomplete (PARTIAL) understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly included a terminal value in their DCF and ran sensitivity analysis (evidence of implementation), so the technical element is present. However, they did not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript reports enterprise/transaction valuation totals and an implemented DCF, but contains no explicit step subtracting Net Debt (Debt less Cash) from EV to arrive at Equity Value, nor any division by share count to produce a Price Per Share. Given those required elements are absent despite implemented valuation work (Discover/Implement), the criterion is not met.",
