  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames DCF as the present-value projection of future free cash flows including a terminal value and shows implementation details (FCF drivers, adjustments). They also demonstrate use of a discount-rate sensitivity (WACC) and validation via implied multiple, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly includes a terminal value (perpetuity growth) and validates it via an implied exit multiple. The sensitivity analysis highlights that terminal growth materially drives enterprise value, demonstrating both inclusion and acknowledgment that TV dominates the valuation — meeting the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five-year explicit forecast from a perpetuity terminal value, uses a declining near-term revenue growth path (8% → 6%) and margin expansion as rationale for short-term strength, and validates terminal assumptions with sensitivity and implied-multiple checks. These elements collectively show a thorough, conceptually sound multi-stage growth treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly treats free cash flow in the DCF context, references \"free cash flow firm\" and \"cash flow available to the firm,\" and models working capital and store roll-out impacts (implying CapEx). However they do not explicitly identify key FCF components such as EBIT/NOPAT and depreciation or separately state CapEx and depreciation items in detail, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript documents an EV result and a recommended bid but includes no evidence of subtracting Net Debt (Debt less Cash) to derive Equity Value or dividing Equity Value by share count to get Price Per Share. Implement and Discover stages confirm valuation work occurred but do not show the required EV→Equity→Price-per-share bridge, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates use of a DCF on firm free cash flows and explicitly tests valuation sensitivity to WACC, indicating conceptual use of WACC as the discount rate (Implement + Validate). However, no specific WACC value, calculation, or defensible source/justification is presented, so the criterion is only partially met.",
