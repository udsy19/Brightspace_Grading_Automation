  "transcript": "ript\n\n\n0:07\nGood evening. We're presenting a\n0:09\nvaluation and bid recommendation for the\n0:11\nacquisition of Panera Bread targeting a\n0:14\nhigh RR investment for KKR. We will\n0:17\nbegin by looking at the Python model of\n0:20\nthe inputs dictionary which centralizes\n0:22\nthe define and the discover stage. I'm\n0:26\nusing Google Collab today with code\n0:28\ngenerated by Google Gemini.\n0:31\nWe're going to start with Panera's\n0:33\nanchor metrics. So, $6 billion in\n0:35\nrevenue and 900 million in EBITDA.\n0:39\nSo, our investment thesis is built on\n0:41\nexploiting the company's strong digital\n0:43\nadoption which we're going to drive the\n0:46\nsignificant operating leverage. The key\n0:48\nchallenge discovered through our market\n0:50\nreferences is competing against\n0:51\nstrategic buyers who can just justify a\n0:54\nmultiple based on synergy. So then we\n0:57\nmove on to represent and implement by\n1:00\nthe core valuation function of the\n1:02\ndiscounted cash flow DCF. This is a\n1:04\nfive-year projection of the free cash\n1:06\nflow firm before calculating the\n1:09\nterminal value. Before I continue, I'm\n1:12\njust going to scroll through these code\n1:14\noutputs.\n1:17\nThis is just the code entered within.\n1:20\nThese are our outputs which give us all\n1:22\nof the graphs numbers the checks\n1:26\nand it even generated these analysis and\n1:30\ngraphs for us for the synergies. So\n1:33\ncheckpoint number one is in the body of\n1:36\nthe function we see our base case\n1:37\nassumptions. So the revenue growth is\n1:39\nthe declining 8% down to 6% by year five\n1:43\nwhich reflects the discipline store roll\n1:45\nout of 500 new units and moderate same\n1:48\nstore sales growth. So the margin is a\n1:51\ncrucial driver. We project the margin\n1:53\nexpansion from 15% up to 17.5% by year\n1:58\nfive. This is KKR's operational value ad\n2:02\nrealized through digital efficiency and\n2:04\nsupply chain optimization. So then\n2:06\nnotice the line calculating um it\n2:09\ndeducts for the store roll out and\n2:11\naccounts for changes in the networking\n2:13\ncapital which gives us cash flow\n2:15\navailable to the firm.\n2:18\nUm we also see\n2:22\nthat the terminal value calculation\n2:25\nemploys the perpetuity growth method\n2:28\nwhich is based on the strong stable\n2:31\nlong-term growth and then when we\n2:32\nexecute the base case DCF the code\n2:36\nprints an interv value enterprise value\n2:39\nof 11 billion. So critically it's also\n2:44\nan implied exit multiple of the 12.2 on\n2:47\nyear six which we use in the validation\n2:49\nstep. So then we um execute the\n2:53\nmarketbased valuations using the\n2:55\nmultiple analysis function. So for the\n2:58\ncomparable company analysis, we select a\n3:01\nrange of 14 to 16 and Panera's high\n3:05\ngrowth merits a premium to general QSR\n3:08\nindustry. And then applying the math, we\n3:11\nget a range of\n3:13\n12.6 to 14.4 billion.\n3:21\nScrolling up here so you can see this.\n3:25\nAnd then for the precedent transactions,\n3:28\nthe market references um are the 12 to\n3:31\n15. So we use the slightly broader 13 to\n3:33\n16 range to account for the competitive\n3:36\nnature of the bidding process. And the\n3:38\ncontrol premium yielding the 11.7%\n3:41\nbillion to 14.4 billion which you see\n3:46\nright here. I just selected it.\n3:50\nSo this provides the intrinsic value\n3:52\nfloor which multiplies um where the\n3:55\nmultiples provide a market-based\n3:57\nvaluation ceiling.\n3:59\nUm the validate stage is crucial for\n4:01\nensuring the robustness of our model and\n4:04\nwe leverage the Python's ability to run\n4:07\nmultiple scenarios instantly. Um\n4:12\nI used all of this right here. Here um\n4:17\nis the DCF sensitivity analysis across\n4:20\nWCZ and terminal growth. The output\n4:22\ntable clearly shows that the EV shifts\n4:25\nin billions with changes to these two\n4:27\nvariables. This confirms that valuation\n4:29\nis highly sensitive to terminal growth\n4:31\nrate underscoring Panera's long-term\n4:33\ngrowth to the primary valuation driver.\n4:37\nSo the fact that our base case implied\n4:38\nmultiple of 12.2 falls within the\n4:41\nprecedent range validates all of our\n4:43\nassumptions. So that did check out for\n4:46\nthe validate stage. And then checkpoint\n4:49\nfive is just the strategic buyer\n4:51\nquantification. That's where we evolved\n4:53\nthe model to incorporate the competitive\n4:55\nreality. So we explicitly quantify the\n4:58\nvalue of synergies for the strategic\n4:59\nbuyers like Starbucks or McDonald's. Um\n5:03\nwe estimate 50 to 100 mil in annual\n5:07\nsynergies primarily from the supply\n5:09\nchain and GNA rationalization. So\n5:12\ndiscounting the perpetuity of these\n5:14\nsynergies uh it's 600 million to 1.2\n5:18\nbillion to the value. So then this\n5:20\nanalysis push it pushes the strategic\n5:23\nbuyer ceiling to from 15.6 a price KKR\n5:28\nas a financial buyer cannot and should\n5:30\nnot match.\n5:34\nHere are all of the sensitivity checks.\n5:38\nThe triangulation shows a competitive\n5:42\num quarter between the DCF and the comps\n5:47\nand precedent high-end. The financial\n5:50\nbuyer discipline is our approach is\n5:51\nanchored by the internal value creation\n5:54\nwhich is the projected margin expansion.\n5:57\nSo we don't pay for the external\n5:59\nsynergies. So then a recommendation\n6:02\nwould be we recommend the KKR bid to\n6:04\n13.75 billion.\n6:07\nUm this recommends and represents a 15.3\n6:12\num ei\n6:15\nmultiple placing us at premium to the\n6:17\nlow end of the market but well below the\n6:20\nuh strategic ceiling. The walkway price\n6:23\nis 12.5 billion representing the floor\n6:25\nof the composite valuation um and the\n6:28\ndisciplined downside. So the rationale\n6:30\nwould be that the bid is positioned to\n6:32\nbe competitive while maintaining KKR's\n6:34\nrequired return profile relying on\n6:36\noperational execution and alignment\n6:39\nprovided by the $10 management\n6:43\nrollover to secure the deal against the\n6:45\ndisciplined strategic offers. And then\n6:48\nby using the disciplined but aggressive\n6:50\nbid of 13.75 billion KKR minimize the\n6:54\nintegration risk they leverage the\n6:57\nmanagement alignment and they maintain\n6:58\nthe financial discipline\n7:01\nrequired for success.\n7:03\nSo here is just one more look at the\n7:07\nvaluation triangulation enterprise value\n7:11\ngraph. all of the sensitivity\n7:13\ninformation,\n7:15\num, more of the triangulation numbers,\n7:18\nmultiples, and everything else that we\n7:21\nlooked at for the code. Thank you."
