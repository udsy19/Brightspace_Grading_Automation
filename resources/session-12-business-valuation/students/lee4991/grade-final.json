  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly projects free cash flows and states they are discounted to present using a calculated WACC (with detailed component inputs and a base-case 9% WACC), and performs terminal-value and sensitivity analysis showing awareness of DCF mechanics and key sensitivities. The treatment is detailed and parameterized, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value using a perpetual growth rate (3%), quantifies it (~79% of intrinsic value), and demonstrates sensitivity analysis and reflective discussion of its importance, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly distinguishes a finite explicit forecast (five years with unit and same-store assumptions) from a terminal period and uses a lower, conservative perpetual growth rate (3%). Multiple scenarios (5%, 7.5%, 9%) and sensitivity testing demonstrate reasonable short-term vs long-term growth reasoning and thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models and references CapEx, working capital adjustments, and discounts projected free cash flows (FCFF) to enterprise value, indicating understanding that these are firm-level cash flows. However, they do not explicitly state key FCF components NOPAT/EBIT (they use EBITDA) nor mention depreciation, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual understanding of bridging EV to equity by reporting enterprise value (DCF) and an LBO debt/equity split that imply subtracting debt to arrive at equity value. However, there is no explicit calculation or mention of dividing resulting equity value by share count to produce a price-per-share, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
