  "transcript": "0:00\nHello everybody. My name is Javier\n0:02\nPatino and this is uh my analysis that\n0:04\nevaluates a potential KKR acquisition of\n0:06\nPanera Bread. Uh my objective is to\n0:08\nrecommend a defensible bid range using\n0:10\nintrinsic valuation and market\n0:12\nbenchmarks while explaining how\n0:13\nfinancial and strategic buyers view\n0:15\nvalue differently. So I'm going to\n0:17\ndefine and discover um the decisions is\n0:19\nwhether Panera Bread uh creates value of\n0:23\n4K at an acquisition price that\n0:25\npreserves downside protection. Panera\n0:27\ngenerates roughly\n0:29\nuh 6 billion in revenue and 900 uh\n0:32\nmillion in EBITDA across more than 2100\n0:36\nstores with digital sales already at\n0:38\n50%. Before modeling, I identified the\n0:42\nmain value drivers which were revenue\n0:45\ngrowth from store expansions and digital\n0:47\nadaptation. Uh margin expansion from\n0:49\noperating leverage, reinvestment,\n0:51\nefficiency, cost of capital and terminal\n0:53\nvalue assumptions.\n0:56\nAnd then uh our next thing is looking at\n0:59\nrepresent our represent section. I\n1:01\nstructured the analysis in three layers.\n1:03\nSo first is my multi- uh my multi-\n1:06\nscenario my DCF to estimate intrinsic\n1:09\nvalue. Uh second is trading comps um and\n1:12\nprecedent transactions to anchor market\n1:14\nreality. Then finally a football field\n1:16\nyou know to synthesize the results into\n1:18\na bid strategy.\n1:20\nUm and off to my implement section. Um I\n1:23\nwe developed well not we but I developed\n1:26\num a DCF with a downside base and upside\n1:29\nuh scenarios uh with the help of um chat\n1:33\nuh with this code. Um the revenue growth\n1:36\nreflects new store openings and a higher\n1:38\ndigital penetration. Um margins improve\n1:41\ngradually through o opening leverage uh\n1:45\nnot opening leverage through operating\n1:46\nleverage rather than aggressive step\n1:48\nchanges. uh free cash flow is discounted\n1:50\nat 9 9% walk and terminal value uses a\n1:54\nconservative per uh perpetual growth\n1:56\nassumption. Um this produces enterprise\n1:59\nvalues at uh 8.6 billion uh about 11\n2:03\nbillion and then 13.3 billion in the\n2:06\nupside. Um\n2:09\nand just to clarify the downside was 8.6\n2:11\n6 billion. The base was the uh 11 11\n2:15\nbillion and the upside was the the 13\n2:18\nbillion. Um off my validate section to\n2:21\nvalidate my results. I validated the DCF\n2:23\nusing market benchmarks uh trading comps\n2:26\num based on 20x to 26x on it um\n2:33\non the P over uh multiple um implied\n2:38\nequity values between 8 and 10.4 4\n2:40\nbillion as you can see here. And then I\n2:43\nhave my um president transactions using\n2:46\n12x plus 15x uh not plus 15x 21x um eb\n2:53\nitda you can see right here and just to\n2:56\ndouble check uh just double checking\n3:01\naudio. Okay, good.\n3:06\nUm sorry. Okay, so they implied the\n3:08\nenterprise value is between 10.8 billion\n3:11\nand 13.5 billion. Um, and then these\n3:15\nranges overlap cleanly with the base on\n3:17\nupside DCF cases. Um, reinforcing\n3:20\nvaluation credibility as you can see um\n3:23\nover here.\n3:26\nUm, now off to\n3:29\nmy evolve\n3:32\nsection.\n3:33\nUm, I also I uh have a visualization\n3:36\nright here. my football field that I\n3:38\nthat we created just to have a visual\n3:40\nvalidation. Um a financial as a\n3:43\nfinancial buyer as for my evolve section\n3:45\num KKR must underwrite returns without\n3:48\nrelying on speculative synergies. Uh so\n3:52\nlike triangulating DCF and president\n3:55\nproduces a financial buyer value uh\n3:58\nrange of roughly 97\n4:01\nto 12 uh sorry hold on to\n4:05\nto 12.2 2 billion um with a walk away\n4:08\nprice uh near at 8.6 billion. Um as you\n4:12\nsee here um\n4:15\nsensitive um sorry strategic buyers um\n4:20\ncan justify a higher valuation due to\n4:23\nscale and digital synergies um which\n4:26\nexplains why they may outbait KKR but\n4:29\nthose synergies carry execution risk. um\n4:33\nsensitivity analysis shows uh valuation\n4:36\nis most affected by WACCC or walk um and\n4:40\nterminal growth assumptions. This\n4:42\nconfirms that long-term macro conditions\n4:44\nand discount rates matter more than\n4:46\nshort-term operating noise. Um given\n4:49\nthat\n4:51\nuh given that after uh running this\n4:53\nsensitivity, our recommendation um or my\n4:56\nrecommendation would uh be for KKR to\n4:59\npursue Panera within the financial buyer\n5:01\nrange um anchoring negotiations near the\n5:03\ncenter of that range and maintaining\n5:05\ndiscipline at that walk away price. Um\n5:07\nKKR should not chase valuation levels um\n5:12\njustified only by strategic synergies.\n5:14\nUm then finally on my reflect section\n5:19\num this analysis reinforced that you\n5:21\nknow valuation is both quantitative and\n5:24\njudgment based. Strong incentive uh not\n5:27\nincentives uh strong investments\n5:30\num and strong investment decisions come\n5:32\nfrom triangulating methods um stress\n5:34\ntesting assumptions and maintaining\n5:36\ndiscipline under uh uncertainty. So yeah\n5:40um thank you for watching my video. US."
