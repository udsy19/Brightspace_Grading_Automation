  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly discounts free cash flows using a stated WACC (9.9%) and constructs multi-scenario DCF outputs, then validates with sensitivity analysis—demonstrating correct conceptual use and application of DCF methodology. The treatment is applied and specific (scenario values and discount rate), meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly ran and reported a multi‑scenario DCF and compared it to trading comparables and precedent transactions, showing overlapping ranges (8.6–13.3bn DCF vs. ~8–13.5bn market anchors). They also discussed sensitivity drivers (WACC, terminal growth) and recommended a financial‑buyer valuation range and walk‑away price, demonstrating thorough triangulation and judgment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly delineated the DCF section, referenced WACC, terminal value, and discounting of free cash flows (PV), and reported specific enterprise values for downside, base, and upside scenarios. Validation via market benchmarks further supports the completeness and credibility of the model structure.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used free cash flow in a DCF and recognized reinvestment as a driver, showing conceptual use of FCF. However, they did not explicitly enumerate FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student included a terminal value using a perpetual growth approach and acknowledged terminal growth materially affects valuation, satisfying the criterion in concept. However treatment is brief and lacks detailed TV calculation, magnitude (e.g., % of total value), or multiple-method comparison, so the response is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguishes an explicit forecast (revenue drivers, margin progression) from a terminal assumption and flags terminal growth as materially important, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment lacks detailed multi-year growth rates or specific short-term vs long-term numeric assumptions, so the coverage is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
