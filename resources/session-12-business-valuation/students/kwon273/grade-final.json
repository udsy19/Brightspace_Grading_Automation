  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly projects free cash flows, states the use of WACC (9%) to discount those cash flows, and calculates a Gordon-growth terminal value—demonstrating correct, detailed application of introductory DCF methodology and alignment across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly outlines the FCF build (EBITDA → EBIT → NOPAT → subtract CapEx and incremental working capital) and implements it in the Implement stage. Discounting FCF using WACC to obtain enterprise value demonstrates understanding that these cash flows are valued as cash available to all providers of capital.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value using the Gordon Growth method with a justified 3% rate and shows model implementation. They also discuss how changes in terminal growth and discount rate materially affect value, demonstrating awareness that terminal assumptions drive valuation outcomes—meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes enterprise value and performs market/transaction validation (Implement and Validate) but never shows subtracting net debt to derive equity value or dividing by share count to produce a price per share. Because the required EV→Equity Value bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly includes the DCF structure components (projections, WACC, terminal value, and PV/discounting) and reports producing enterprise value outputs. However, the transcript does not present any specific numeric enterprise value(s) for review—only that a table was produced—so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the valuation object (Panera) and acquisition context and clearly identifies KKR and strategic buyer stakeholders. However, they do not explicitly identify Panera management as a key stakeholder, so the requirement to name both KKR and Management is not fully met.",
