  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes a DCF engine that computes free cash flows and terminal value and demonstrates application via scenario automation and a numeric sensitivity to cost of capital (discount rate). Implementation evidence and linkage to decision-making show a thorough introductory-level grasp of DCF methodology and use of a discounting framework, satisfying the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student ran and compared multiple valuation approaches (DCF, LBO, and market comps), performed sensitivity analysis on key drivers (WACC, growth), and translated results into a recommended bid range with rationale. This demonstrates a thorough triangulation and discussion of which valuations are reasonable, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission explicitly documents DCF model sections (projections, FCF mechanics, terminal value) and addresses cost of capital sensitivity, and it reports specific enterprise value outputs (e.g., ~$7.5B target and $10.8B opening bid). The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) provide coherent evidence that the model structure and a numeric EV were implemented and checked, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly cites key FCF components (taxes, capex, working capital) and uses EBITDA as a starting metric, and demonstrates practical application (using cash flows to service debt). However, they do not explicitly state depreciation or NOPAT/EBIT adjustment, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, earning a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a terminal value calculation in their DCF engine and performs sensitivity analysis around terminal growth (evidence of applied understanding). However, they do not explicitly state that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of enterprise value; the treatment is correct but relatively brief, so it meets PARTIAL rather than full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit five-year forecast and a terminal value, provides distinct short-term growth scenarios (4%, 8%, 11%), and runs sensitivities between \"walk\" and terminal growth (Implement evidence). However, terminal growth rates themselves are not specified nor justified relative to the forecast (limited discussion on why long-term rates would be lower), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
