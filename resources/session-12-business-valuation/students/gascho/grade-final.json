  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly frames a DCF by building free cash flows from EBITDA, specifying reinvestment and terminal growth, and explicitly cites a 9% WACC as the discounting benchmark. The treatment is detailed (multi-scenario DCF, FCF construction, terminal value) and demonstrates thorough, introductory-level mastery of the DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value using a 2.5% perpetual growth rate and integrates it into a multi-scenario DCF, and they state that terminal value comprises about two-thirds of total value—fulfilling both required points. The Implement and Represent stages provide the calculational detail and integration, while Validate contextualizes the TV share, supporting a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit five-year forecast period from a terminal period and uses multi-scenario (base/upside/downside) reasoning. The assumed short-term growth (8%) and lower long-term perpetual growth (2.5%) are reasonable and justified (terminal share acknowledged), demonstrating thorough multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual approach by building FCF from operating cashflow drivers (EBITDA after taxes and reinvestment) and using it in a DCF to derive enterprise value (implying cash to all capital providers). However, they do not explicitly identify standard FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or explain their treatment, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports enterprise-value results and a bid range (Represent/Validate) but never shows subtracting net debt or converting Equity Value to Price Per Share (no net-debt adjustment or share-count division). Because the specific EV-to-Equity bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly summarizes valuation outcomes and triangulates DCF, comps, and precedent ranges, demonstrating understanding. However, it does not explicitly present or reference a distinct table or simple chart as a visual summary; therefore the visual-summary requirement is only partially satisfied.",
