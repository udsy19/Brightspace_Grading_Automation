  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the PV of future free cash flows, details projecting FCF and discounting steps, and demonstrates use of WACC (including sensitivity analysis). Across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages they show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value calculation in the DCF and its PV, and repeatedly acknowledges that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of enterprise value, with sensitivity analysis showing its impact. These elements demonstrate a thorough, professional treatment of the terminal value concept across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates an explicit forecast period (10 years) from a terminal value and models higher short-term growth (40% initial declining to a mature floor) with lower long-term terminal assumptions. They supplement this with sensitivity grids and scenario analysis, demonstrating thorough, well-supported multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies FCF components (EBIT/margins→tax/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, NWC) and states FCF as cash after reinvestment, shown in the Implement and Discover stages. However the treatment is conceptual and brief without detailed walkthroughs or numeric examples, so it meets a correct but not thorough standard — PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes Enterprise Value and compares it to the $500M ask, but the transcript contains no mention of subtracting Net Debt (or debt less cash) to derive Equity Value nor dividing by share count to obtain Price Per Share. Therefore the specific EV→Equity→Per‑share bridge is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly uses WACC to discount enterprise free cash flows and demonstrates sound practice by running sensitivity analyses and sanity checks, showing conceptual mastery (Implement + Reflect). However, they do not present a defensible single WACC estimate or a calculation/justification (industry average or CAPM), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
