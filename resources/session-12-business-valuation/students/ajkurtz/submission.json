  "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,590\nHi, my name is\nAlex Kurtz, and\n\n2\n00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,350\nthis is my session\n12 assignment.\n\n3\n00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,950\nSo what we are\ndoing here is we are\n\n4\n00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,410\nthinking like a\nprivate equity investor\n\n5\n00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,870\nand looking into\nan acquisition of\n\n6\n00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,190\nPanera Bread. So the\nfast casual chain.\n\n7\n00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,830\nSo we're valuing\nPanera Bread,\n\n8\n00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,630\nkind of walking\nthrough here.\n\n9\n00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,930\nWe're buying. So who\nis buying is KKR. So\n\n10\n00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,770\nKKR is this financial\ngroup, and so we are\n\n11\n00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:40,030\ntrying to analyze\nPanera's value through\n\n12\n00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,690\nthree different\nmethods, DCF, comps, and\n\n13\n00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,650\npresidents. So we are\ngiven some assumptions.\n\n14\n00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,410\nRevenue, EBI,\n\n15\n00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,710\nEBITDA, which is\nearnings before income\n\n16\n00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,550\nor before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation,\n\n17\n00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,670\namortization, our\nWOC, which are\n\n18\n00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,810\nweighted average cost\nof capital growth.\n\n19\n00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,010\nAnd so we're trying\nto end up finding our\n\n20\n00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,850\ndecision. What price\nshould KKR pay? Okay,\n\n21\n00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,210\nso before we start,\nwe're defining the\n\n22\n00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,910\nproblem. We're\nvaluing Panera for a\n\n23\n00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,930\npotential KKR acquisition.\nWe are documenting,\n\n24\n00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,450\nwe're scaling,\nwe're growing, and\n\n25\n00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430\ndocumenting margins,\ncapital assumptions,\n\n26\n00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,610\nand market context.\nSo our valuation is\n\n27\n00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,590\nanchored in facts\nrather than outputs.\n\n28\n00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,410\nSo that's kind of what we\n\n29\n00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,150\nhave going in\nour stage here.\n\n30\n00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,530\num so now going to\nour uh so we have our\n\n31\n00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,750\ncore assumptions here\nthis is all given so\n\n32\n00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,710\nwe have our revenue\nour EBITDA net income\n\n33\n00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,710\nour digital mix our\ntax rate depreciation\n\n34\n00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,590\num and then we have\nlike an opposition\n\n35\n00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:55,210\nlike uh value or market\nshare uh so yeah we\n\n36\n00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,250\nhave then we have three\ndifferent scenarios.\n\n37\n00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,890\nWe have a downside,\na base, and an\n\n38\n00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,130\nupside. So a downside\nis kind of like our\n\n39\n00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:10,790\nworst case scenario for\nthe future growth of\n\n40\n00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,690\nPanera. So it's\nslower growth and flat\n\n41\n00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,530\nmargins. Then we have\nour base right here.\n\n42\n00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,450\nThat is a management\nplan execution. So\n\n43\n00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,450\nif it kind of just\nstays the same, that's\n\n44\n00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,890\nkind of what it's\ngoing to look like.\n\n45\n00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,430\nAnd then we have our\nupside, which is strong,\n\n46\n00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,190\nmargin expansion and\ngrowth so we have\n\n47\n00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,430\nnew stores new digital\nmarketing and growth\n\n48\n00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,630\nthrough the digital\nsector and stuff like\n\n49\n00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,900\nthat so now we are\ngoing to build our model\n\n50\n00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,670\nhere so our revenue\ngrows each year based\n\n51\n00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,650\non our scenarios so\nit reflects new stores\n\n52\n00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,730\nsame same store sales\nand digital penetration\n\n53\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,970\nwe factor in our\ntaxes and so we kind\n\n54\n00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,230\nof find our free cash\nflow so we're trying\n\n55\n00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,190\nto find our free cash\nflow so our free cash\n\n56\n00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,690\nflow represents the\ncash available to all\n\n57\n00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,290\ncapital providers that\nwe model through capex\n\n58\n00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:18,080\nand working capital\nso now we see our in\n\n59\n00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,550\nour driver stage three\nwe say our DCF results\n\n60\n00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,750\nwhich give us our\ndownside our base in\n\n61\n00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,910\nour upside so it gives\nus a range of values\n\n62\n00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:32,250\nthat we should pay so\nnow we have trading\n\n63\n00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,630\ncomps right here so\ntrading comps inform\n\n64\n00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,670\nour market expectations\nbut understate what\n\n65\n00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,670\na buyer must pay to\nacquire control so it\n\n66\n00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,430\nreflects minority\nownership we are using\n\n67\n00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,210\nindustry averages from\nMcDonald's Chipotle in\n\n68\n00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,050\nthese and then our\npresent transactions\n\n69\n00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,610\nbasically include our\ncontrol reflect our real\n\n70\n00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,510\nmoney paid and usually\nset the auction\n\n71\n00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,690\nclearing price for our\npresent transactions\n\n72\n00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,210\nand then we go into\nour strategic synergies\n\n73\n00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,630\nbasically what this\nmodel shows is 150\n\n74\n00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,810\nmillion dollars EBITDA\nour tax adjusted rates\n\n75\n00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,030\nare discounted or\nrisk adjusted. So this\n\n76\n00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,790\nis key for us because\nKKR cannot guarantee\n\n77\n00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,250\nsynergies and they\nshouldn't pay for\n\n78\n00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,900\nthem. So that's like\nkind of like goodwill.\n\n79\n00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,950\nStrategic, so it may\njustify higher bids\n\n80\n00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,950\nface integration risks.\nSo this explanation,\n\n81\n00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,030\nthis explains the\nstrategic synergy model\n\n82\n00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,950\nexplains the valuation\ngap between financial\n\n83\n00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,630\nand strategic buyers.\nSo financial buyers\n\n84\n00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,660\nare going to analyze\njust hard capital and\n\n85\n00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,230\nvalue and strategic\nbuyers are going to factor\n\n86\n00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,510\nin more of goodwill\nthat we talk about\n\n87\n00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,890\nespecially in accounting\na goodwill is an\n\n88\n00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,690\nintangible asset that it\ncould reflect a strong\n\n89\n00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,970\nmanagement team synergies\nyeah it's basically\n\n90\n00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,960\nwhat you pay over\nfinancial value so we\n\n91\n00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,950\nhave our sensitivity\nanalysis are basically\n\n92\n00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,770\nand then this is kind\nof like our kind of\n\n93\n00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,310\nlike final thing here\nit's we call it the\n\n94\n00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,810\nfootball field so what\nthis does is it combines\n\n95\n00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,450\nour DCF range our\ntrading comps present\n\n96\n00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,870\nstrategic value so this\nis a decision slide\n\n97\n00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,230\nso basically it's\ngoing to produce this\n\n98\n00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,550\nimage right here and we\nwill get into that in\n\n99\n00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,630\na second and then we\ngot here we have our\n\n100\n00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,970\nvalidate evolve and\nreflect so basically we\n\n101\n00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,650\nvalidate so we see the\nmath works and responds\n\n102\n00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,930\ncorrectly to our\ndrivers a full LBO model\n\n103\n00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,610\nwould sharpen the max\nbid and the risk is\n\n104\n00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,690\noverpaying for optionality\nit's kind of what\n\n105\n00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,470\nwe're analyzing there\nso a financial buyer\n\n106\n00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,830\nwould like KKR would\nanchor with the base\n\n107\n00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,350\nDCF walk away if there's\nlow-end precedence\n\n108\n00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,710\nbut a strategic buyer\ncan pay more for\n\n109\n00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,550\nthose synergies but you\nwant to make sure that\n\n110\n00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,610\nthose synergies are\nreal and executable so\n\n111\n00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,470\nnow if we go down here\nto our football field\n\n112\n00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,230\nso what this shows\nis that Panera's\n\n113\n00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,410\nstandalone value clusters\naround the base case\n\n114\n00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,870\nDCF while present\ntransactions define the\n\n115\n00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,430\ncompetitive clearing\nrange as a financial buyer\n\n116\n00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,370\nKKR should anchor\nits bid on intrinsic\n\n117\n00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,250\ncash flow and cap its\nwillingness to pay near\n\n118\n00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,590\nthe low end of precedence,\nso around here.\n\n119\n00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,550\nStrategic buyers may\njustify higher prices\n\n120\n00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,910\nthrough synergies,\nbut those benefits\n\n121\n00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,150\nare not transferable\nto KKR. Therefore,\n\n122\n00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,710\ndiscipline, not\nwinning the auction,\n\n123\n00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,270\nshould define the bid.\nSo KKR should be bid\n\n124\n00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,050\nnear the base case\nDCF, walk away at the\n\n125\n00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,150\nlow end of precedence,\nso here. So this\n\n126\n00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,770\nis strategic value\nhere, and this is the\n\n127\n00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,210\nprecedence, which\nkind of factors in\n\n128\n00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,810\nthat goodwill that we\nwere talking about.\n\n129\n00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,070\nAnd if we factor in\nthat goodwill, like\n\n130\n00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,050\nit can go up to here,\nbut we don't know\n\n131\n00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,070\nfor KKG that that's\nnot viable for\n\n132\n00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,710\nthem. They want a\nfinancial kind of look\n\n133\n00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,350\nat it. They're not\nreally in a strategic,\n\n134\n00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,150\nthey're purely in\na financial mode.\n\n135\n00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,570\nSo somebody in a\nstrategic mode would bid\n\n136\n00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,490\nkind of anywhere in\nthis purple bar here.\n\n137\n00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,700\nBut the president or\nthe financial KKG group\n\n138\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,470\nwould look at it\nmore in this brown\n\n139\n00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,810\nstrategic value. So they\ndon't want to really\n\n140\n00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,010\ngo any really far into\nthis purple sector.\n\n141\n00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,030\nSo we want them\nto bid lower.\n\n142\n00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,350\nSo, yeah, we are\nrecommending bidding\n\n143\n00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,030\nmodestly above the\nbase intrinsic value\n\n144\n00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,770\nto remain competitive.\nBut we're going\n\n145\n00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,810\nto remain below\npresident midpoints to\n\n146\n00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,990\nprotect returns.\nSo we're trying to\n\n147\n00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,690\nprotect our investments\nhere.
