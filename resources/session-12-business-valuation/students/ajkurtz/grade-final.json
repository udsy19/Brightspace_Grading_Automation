  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly triangulated valuation using DCF, trading comps, and precedent transactions, produced scenario-based DCF ranges and sensitivity analysis, and explicitly recommended anchoring the bid to the base-case DCF while using precedent lows as a walk-away — demonstrating a thorough, conceptually complete treatment that meets the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly produced and described a visual summary (\"football field\") that consolidates DCF, trading comps, and precedent ranges and used it to recommend a bid anchoring near the base DCF. While numeric table cells aren't shown in the transcript, the detailed conceptual description and use of the visual to inform decisions meets the moderate-standard requirement for this criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defines key inputs (revenue, WACC/growth implied among core assumptions) and demonstrates multiple mechanisms (downside/base/upside scenarios, sensitivity analysis) showing the model responds to input changes and validation that \"math works.\" This meets the moderate-category standard for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies free cash flow as the basis for the DCF and references WACC/discounting, showing conceptual understanding and execution (IMPLEMENT). However the treatment is high-level and lacks detailed demonstration of discounting mechanics or worked examples; under the rubric this is correct but basic, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key FCF elements conceptually (taxes/NOPAT implication, capex, working capital, and depreciation listed in assumptions) and states that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, but the treatment is brief and lacks detailed numerical demonstration or multiple examples. This meets a correct but basic conceptual understanding, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript discusses free cash flow and DCF results but contains no explicit Terminal Value calculation (growth or multiple) nor any statement acknowledging that Terminal Value typically comprises the majority of DCF value. Therefore the criterion is not demonstrated.",
