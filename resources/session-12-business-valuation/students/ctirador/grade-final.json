  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as PV of future free cash flows discounted at WACC and applies it in modeled scenarios (implementing code and reporting a $13B intrinsic DCF value). This shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly states that FCFF should be discounted at WACC and uses a defensible industry WACC (9%) as a capital assumption, which was applied in the implemented DCF to produce an intrinsic value. This shows correct application and an appropriate, justifiable WACC choice.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulates valuation methods (DCF scenarios and comparable/precedent multiples including strategic ceiling) and reports numeric downside/base/upside and multiples-based values, then discusses which value guides bidding (stop above $13B intrinsic, opening bid $11.5B). The analysis includes scenario sensitivity and strategic vs financial buyer implications, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames value as the PV of future free cash flows discounted at WACC and applied a DCF model, showing understanding that FCF drives enterprise value. However, they do not explicitly identify the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or demonstrate their calculation, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly included terminal value methods (multiple/exits and referenced multi-stage growth) and applied them in the DCF outputs and bidding decisions (Represent/Implement/Reflect). However, they did not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of a DCF's value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct, applied multi-stage thinking by citing a multi-stage model, short-term growth levers (500 stores in 5 years), and scenario-specific growth assumptions implemented in the DCF. However, they do not clearly separate an explicit forecast period from a terminal (long‑term) period nor fully justify lower long‑term growth/terminal assumptions (no stated terminal growth rate or transition rationale), so the treatment is correct but not thorough.",
