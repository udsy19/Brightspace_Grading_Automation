  "transcript": "For this session assignment, we are to\ndeliver a full valuation of Panera bread\nfor prospective KKR takeover using\ndriver. So for the information that\nwe're given the scale uh so for we have\na $6 billion revenue growing at 8% with\na $900 million IBITa uh 15% uh margin\n$400 million net income across 2,100\nstores digital sales already at 50%. uh\nmarket references. So the industry uh\nprice to earnings is 22x. The president\nI beta multiplies 12 to 15x and then\nChipotle trades at 35x the price to\nearnings and McDonald's at 25x. So for\ncapital assumptions the industry walk 9%\nuh the management wants a 10% rollover\nand strategic biders Starbucks and\nMcDonald's are circling.\nSo for growth levers 500 new stores in 5\nyears digital mix to 70% dinner catering\nexpansion and early stage international\nrollout. So for the management uh some\nnotes to take uh from this information.\nSo the management wants a 10% rollover.\nThis means that they believe that the\ncompany will continue to grow. This\nshows that it is a positive uh company\nthat will grow in the future. Um\nso the some information that we'll be\nusing uh is the industry price to\nearnings 22x the president I ea\nmultiplies 12 12 to 15x and then the\nwalk is 9%. Uh the strategic ceiling uh\nis the 35 price to earnings that we get\nfrom Chipotle and then we're going to\nmultiply that by the net income uh to\nfind the strategic ceiling. So the\nobjective for um this uh assignment is\nto construct evaluation of Panera bread\nthrough the use of DCF analysis and\nassess financial buyer versus strategic\nbuyer perspectives. We also want to\ntriangulate the approaches and recommend\na bidding strategy for KKR.\nSo for the represent stage we'll be\nusing a few of these um formulas that we\nget from the chapter uh the free cash\nflow calculation uh the multi-stage\ngrowth model determinal value\ncalculation are a few that we'll be\nusing. We also be thinking about the\nenterprise valuation principle. A\ncompany's value equals the present value\nof its future free cash flows discounted\nat the weighted average cost of capital\nplus non-operating assets.\nSo for implement I went and asked Gemini\nto create uh code for me based off these\num values. So here you can see some of\nthe inputs\num the capital assumptions the valuation\nper parameters\num we can see\na few of the calculations\nuh the DCF uh scenarios\num and then we can look here I have to\nvalidate\nuh these values which the DCF uh\ndownside is 8.82 82 billion. The\npresident floor uh with the 12x is 10.8\nbillion. The DCF base which is intrinsic\nvalue is 13 billion. The president\nceiling is 15x at 15x is 13.5 billion.\nDCF upside um is 16.13 billion and then\nthe strategic ceiling is the 35x price\nto earnings that we got from Chipotle\nwith his 14 billion. So to validate the\npres president floor of 10.8 billion the\nlowest defensible marketplace this is\nthe walkway price for the seller and the\npresident ceiling of 13.5 billion is the\ntop end of market expectations. The DCF\nbase 13 billion if the b goes over this\nthen we would stop bidding this is our\nintrinsic value. The DCF upside is 16.13\nbillion uh which is is if the 10th it is\ngrowing at 10% with margin expanding to\ndo 16% with a 14x exit the this is the\ndream scenario the DCF downside uh is at\n4% growth with mar mar mar mar mar mar\nmar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar\nmar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar\nmar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar\nmar mar mar mar margin contracting at.2%\n2% per year uh with 11 times exit and\nthen the strategic ceiling which is the\nhighest valuation for a strategic\nstrategic buyer. So uh for our opening\nbid we'll be opening at 11.5 billion\nbecause it is above the walkway price\nfor seller and gives a margin of safety\nbelow the intrinsic value of $13\nbillion.\nSo for uh evolve how do synergies uh\naffect this data? uh we went ahead and\nasked Gemini to give us\nuh a way to calculate a few of these\nthings for the inputs from the previous\nstep. We have quantifying the synergies.\nWe have LBO returns analysis\nand then IR calculation.\nSo looking at this data we can look at\nthe strategic synergy evaluation first.\nUm so the annual pre pre-tax synergies\nis 153 million which is the cost of\ngoods sold plus the SGNA uh and then the\nvalue of the synergies uh we can see\nhere is the NPV of synergies for\nstrategic buyers which is around $1.4 4\nbillion which gives us the strategic\ntrue ceiling of $14.93 billion. And then\nthe LBO return analysis. So total\nsources/ users is the total transaction\nprice which is $1.5 billion bid plus the\ntransa transaction fees. And then for\ndebt raised we use a leverage ratio of\nsix uh yeah of six. Uh this is an\nassumption made by uh Gemini. The KKR\nequity check is um\nlet me check. Okay. Is the uh 1.65\nbillion total transaction price minus\nthe $5.4 billion debt and then the\nmanagement rollover of $1 billion which\nis approximately 10%. And then the for\nexit enterprise value. So we sell the\nvalue of the company for 21\nuh19 billion. We assume that the that\n50% of the debt is paid over the five\nyears. Uh the total equity at exit is\ntotal enterprise value minus debt. And\nthen KKR exit proceeds is the total\nequity at exit times the KKR ownership.\nSo the KKR ownership is the KKR equity\ncheck uh divided by equity check plus\nthe management rollover.\nThen for the returns we have a 24.2%\nIRRa which is higher than what most\nprivate equity firms target. U most\nprivate equity firms target a 20% IRRa.\nAnd then the is for every dollar\ninvested how much did we get back? So\nfor every dollar invested we get $2.96\nback.\nSo for the overall strategy that we have\nuh for KKR so we start with an opening\nbid of 11.5 billion which is higher than\nthe walk away price of the sellers and\nlower than the intrinsic value that we\nhave calculated $13 billion. We offer a\n10% management rollover. This will help\nus get an edge over the strategic\nbuyers. And then we continue bidding\nuntil we reach our walk away price where\nour irr goes below 20% which is around\n$12.3 billion.\nSo to reflect, we determined that the\nstrategic buyers have an advantage when\nit comes to the buying price of the\ncompany. This is due to synergies that\nallow them to save $1.4 billion by\npurchasing the company. We can gain an\nedge uh bidding for the company by\nchanging the structure to the deal and\nadding a 10% management rollover. This\nwill allow KKR to align with the\nmanagement of Panera. So although our\nreturn analysis relies on a few\nassumptions, we're able to have a uh\nconfidence due to the margin of safety\nthat is created uh by bidding\nat 11.5 billion.That is all. Thank you."
