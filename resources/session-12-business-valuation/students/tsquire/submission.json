  "transcript": "Okay. Hello. My name is Trevor Squire and this is my session 12 or very last um assignment. Please ignore my hair. I know it looks crazy. Um but so this one was definitely a lot uh especially when trying to plug everything into collab. Um quick summary or quick analysis of the assignment. So I was supposed to deliver a full violation of Panera for a prospective KKR takeover using driver. Um combine DCF trading comps and president transactions to produce and inform bid range while contrasting financial buyer discipline with strategic buyer synergies. Um this is all the data given the scale market references capital assumptions and growth levers. says create an executive um ready recommendation that states the valuation range, winning bid strategy and rationale for choosing financial versus strate strategic positioning always using a driver framework. So um that is pretty much the assignment. So this one did take a very very long time. Um, basically I did things I'm I'm still using collab um for the assignment, but I did things a little bit differently. Um, first thing I would did was warn to chat GBT to give me a prompt. Um, it gave me some different code to plug in, but every time I plugged it into Collab, the data wasn't matching the assignment. So, what I did, it took forever. I went into each uh I explained like what took colola what my situation is and pretty much said okay like literally was like pretty please make sure you understand this um I give it this I literally type the scale cuz when I copy and pasted the data still wasn't right so I'll be like here's the scale I type out all this data and then the market references I did all that typed it out and I keep telling it um please reiterate it towards me so I know that you have the information correctly. And basically what I had to do is create a library of all the information that was from the assignment. So um like all this like is from me just telling it to um take the information and re reiterate it so I know it understands it. And then in the end, let me find my start here. I also had to organize everything um by like comments because it's very long. But up here here, this is literally all the data for the assignment. Um this is also going to take definitely like three to four videos cuz it's actually a lot when I plugged it in. Um it really shouldn't be, but it just gave me a lot of great information to use and really went into detail on everything even though I told it to go a little bit less. But yeah, I first thing I did was have um Collab make a library of all the information, reiterate it so I knew and understood and then it took that information and went along with the assignment. Um for every section like using the driver framework, I'd say okay go into the um define discover section, go into the represent section, it will like um go into every section. Sometimes I mess up data like not mess up data. Sometimes it would be um like things didn't like come out right so be like there's a problem let me try it again stuff like that. Um sometimes it went perfectly and it took a very long time but yeah sorry I just wasted like 3 minutes yapping. I'm going to get started. So first we are going to go over a little overview of the valuation methodologies methodology. Wow methodologies. Um so first is the um DCF analysis. So this values company based on present value of projected future free cash flows. Then there's the trading comparables or trading comps analysis. This approach um values Panera by comparing financial metrics and operating characteristics to those similar uh publicly traded companies. Um so I think for examples like enterprise oh no no no sorry um identify peer group of companies in the restaurant or fast casual industry um precedent transactions analysis. So this estimates Panera's value uh by examining multiples paid in recent merger and acquisition transactions involving companies similar to Panera. So in that case we did McDonald's and Starbucks. Um so by utilizing these methodologies we'll obtain multiple valuation perspectives. So those are the methodologies. Um next is the data analysis. So um so this is kind of like analyzing the data it was given a little bit um but knowing like what exactly it's going to do not like the actual data itself but like what um I guess functions or what um analysis it's going to use um pretty much incorporating what it was given into whatever data it's going to use. So um so the information dictionary for example that's the thing I made and it pretty much matches up that dictionary with what it's supposed to do. Um again we have the analysis um some insights next steps. So it confirmed the completeness of the information and is going to proceed to implement the outline valuation methodologies. So that was kind of and that was kind of a quick summary of what uh the like just defining what the problem is or knowing like what it's going to do. So now we're going to go into the represent. So um again everything's um organized by comments because it takes forever. Double check my time because I know it's going to take a while. Um so for our present we have the DCF analysis plan. Um so this is a little bit more detail. So to com um so com to conduct a comprehensive DCF um you need to follow some detailed steps. First is define the forecast period which is five year explicit forecast period for 2017 to 2021 and establish the detailed assumptions for the forecast period. We're doing the revenue revenue growth rates operating expenses like cost of goods sold and selling or um administrative expenses. um the capital expenditures, depreciation, um change in net working capital, tax rate, all that kind of stuff. Um there's the um project financial statements like the income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, typical things you find in accounting. Um calculating the free cash flow to free cash flow to firm FCF. um and then calculating the terminal value or TV. Um and then there's the Gordon growth model and exit multiple approach and then determining the weighted average cost of capital WCC. That's very important. Um so there's the cost of equity, cost of debt, market value of equity, market value of debt, and then the tax rate. And it gives you the different formulas that it's going to use to calculate each thing. So cost of equity, tax rate, stuff like that, as well as the um free cash flow to a firm. Um going it's going to calculate the enterprise value and then calculate equity value. Um and again like everything is very detailed. It gives you a description of what it is and what it's going to do. Um next part is the trading comparable plan. So this is a detailed strategy for the um trading comparables analysis. So identify um robust peer groups. Select a group of public publicly traded restaurant companies that are similar to Panera in terms of business model. Um collect key financial and operating metrics for each identified um comparable company. I uh gather gather recent uh financial data including revenue u net income market capitalization etc etc. Uh calculate the enterprise value and equity value. Um it also gives you um what the formulas are for that and then select the appropriate valuation multiples. So enterprise value um the price and earnings um p/ um calculate the multiples for comparables apply multiples to Panera's financials adjust for Panera specific factors and that part is consider any unique characteristics of Panera and it warrants adjustments to the multiple application potentially leading to premium or discount compared to pure average. So that's um it's kind of adjusting to the factors that it finds and then comparing it to other um industries like McDonald's, Starbucks and figuring out how we going to change how can we make Panaro better. Then there's the president transactions plan. Um so identify the research and identify research um president transactions. So there's the research M&A deal. So this will identify recent merger and acquisition on deals in the restaurant sector. Um and then focus on disclosed values which is prioritizing deals with publicly disclosed transaction values and financial information for the target company at the time of acquisition. So some key resources include S&P capital uh IQ Bloomberg merger market etc. Then it'll gather financial metrics for the target companies. Um so it'll extract financials like revenue, EBITDA and then net income and then document those transactions in detail. Um then calculate transaction multiples. First you compute the enterprise value. Um we were given that formula earlier. Calculate the multiples. Um,Okay. Um sorry, make sure. Okay. Yes, that one did record. Um so after so next is calculate transaction multiples. Um like I said the um EV the enterprise value and then the um multiples which is your enterprise value. Um and then your or enterprise value EBITDA and the enterprise value under revenue and then ensure the consistency. So verify that the financial metrics used um like the revenue and the EBITDA correspond to the last 12 months. Um products and transaction announcement date and are consistently defined across all deals. Um then analyze and establish multiple range. So data organization statistical analysis outlier review um consider president IBA TDA multiples range. Okay. I'm like I don't I don't remember like it being looking like that. Um so that's your minimum maximum that were given the 12 to the 15. Apply multiples to Panera's um financials. So retrieve the Panera financials. Estimate the enterprise value. Create value valuation range. Um adjust for specific factors. So qualitative adjustment. So any unique characteristics of Panera Bread or the current market conditions that might warrant adjustments to the multiple application. So those include digital sales percentage, new stores, dinner catering expansion, international rollout. And then there's also premium and discount rationale. All this is given from the assignment. Determine these factors. Suggest a premium or discount compared to average of the president transactions. Um and then synthesize the results. So combine the ranges, incorporate market references and establish preliminary bid ranges and then um synthes the represent is very long. I know let me see how much is left. Okay, so I I'm not I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing not go too much into detail. Um so synthesize the data um collab. The task was to describe the process for synthesizing valuations from DCF trading comparables and then um presented transactions to establish preliminary bid range. So synthesize values and establish preliminary bid range. Um so this focuses on synthesizing results from valuation methodologies to arrive at comprehensive bid range for Panera bread. So it will review and organize the valuation ranges analyze u methol method methodological uh strengths and weaknesses. So that can be under DCF trading comparables present in transactions. Um reconcile the valuation ranges like waiting averaging overlapping range incorporate um financial buyer discipline. So consider um KKR's financial buyer will primarily focus on financial engineering and operational improvements. Um account for management rollover percentage from the information store which was 10%. And then financial buyers typically value company based on standalone um unlevered free cash flow generation um potential and then layer on debt capacity to enhance returns. Then incorporate strategic buyer synergies. Um so those are analyzing the potential for strategic buyers, identify potential synergies, um quantify synergies, um establish a preliminary bid range and then document key assumptions, sensitivities. So um final task is well under collab is summarizing everything. So um so data analysis key findings detailed DCF analysis plan detailed trading comparables plan um detailed president transactions plan and then comprehensive valuation synthesize plan. So that is pretty much all of the represent section. Um and then next task is in the implement section which this one is definitely a lot and there's a little bit of um represent in there as well. I'm just going to skip over it cuz it's just reiterating everything just so it's organized a bit. So it just knows like okay this is what I'm implementing and this is how it connects to the represent section. I'm just going to skip over it. Um so now we have the implement um collab's task was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of Panerabed including DCF um analys DCF analysis projecting financials and FCFF um utilizing financial data and then synthesizing the valuations. So first things first DCF analysis pro project financials in FCFF. Like I said, this is definitely going to take a couple videos. Um, so this part requires implementing the DCF analysis steps, including projecting revenue, operating expenses, DNA, all that stuff, and calculating SCFF for the 5-year forecast period. So, um, I pretty much told Collab to do what I always wanted to do, give me a description of what it's doing, and then give me the code that it's using. So, I'll use a code block to to perform these calculations. So this is um so again this is um implementing DCF analysis steps um projecting revenue operating expenses all that stuff. So first it defines the forecast period. It initializes dictionary to store that all that data. Uh it gets the base values from information store. It defines the assumptions which is all given. Um it has the initial values for projection loop which is your current revenue equal to your base revenue. Um project financials for each year. Um so it gives the forecast years and um projections. Next is the project project revenue which just gives you the formulas and the numbers that it plugs in over here. As you can see, um project operating operating expenses, the project um depreciation and mortarization, um project capital expenditures, and then the project changes in networking capital. Um calculating free cash flow to the firm. U calculating FCFF um and then update the current revenue for the next iteration and then convert to um a better further analysis. So here are all the results. So this is the year the revenue EBITDA DNA capex uh NWC change EBIT and then FCFF. So this is for year 0 2017 to year 4 2021. So it's a 4-year period and it just gives a quick analysis of the data. So next step in the analysis calculate the terminal value at the end of the forecast period. So again here is all the data and all the calculations it does to solve um and then in the end we're given the terminal value um which is under the Gordon growth model which is um 8532.12 million um and then the terminal value XM multiple EVI EV EVDITA which is 16252.21 21 million average terminal value is 12 3892.16 million which is subtracting those two um sum of value SCF SCFs that's just the sum of FCFF present value terminal value um the DCF derived enterprise value and then the DCF derived equity value um next is okay this is again represent I'm just going to skip over this or if you want you can just get a quick look at it um but it's basically saying what it's going to do next and knowing what it's going to identify. Uh next is trading comparables analysis. So this will identify the peer group, collect financial data for the peer group, calculate the EV value, um calculate multiples for the peer group, apply multiples to printer's financials, establish a trading comps valuation range and then store all that all those results. So for reasoning the previous steps successfully calculate DCF valuation. Now following that plan um collab will implement the trading comparables analysis using hypothetical data for the peer group and Panera's financials um from the information store that um little information thing I made to estimate value and store the results. So here we are hypothetical peer group data. Um this is just all hypothetical. Calculates the enterprise value the multiples for pure group. Determines the median multiples. It gets the financials from the information storage that I made. Um it applies multiples to Panera's financials. Um calculates equity value. Um so then it's assuming net debt is zero for Panera. Um it will solve a placeholder for not explicitity provided and consistent with DCF for now. Adjust equity value from EV if we want to be consistent but be directly equity value. Um is this a lot of information? Oh no, wrong one. I'm just checking my time cuz I know it's going to be a while. Um establishes trading cost valuation range. Um stores the results in information storage. So that's where it is right here. So the peer group median is 19.23. Peer group median pashi is 33.33. Oh. Um Panera's estimated enterprise value is um I'm just going to show not say cuz it's so much. Pen's estimated equity value um Panzer's trading comps EV range which is um 15,000 to Sorry, the trading comps EV range is from 15 to 19 million. Um, and then the trading comps equity value range is from 12 to 14 million. So, next is the precedent transactions plan. Again, this is all the represent if you just want to quickly look at it. Um, just quick details on what it's going to look at. Um and then the steps on what the steps in order. Um so then implementing it. So identify president transactions again hypothetical gather financial data and transaction details. Calculate um EV calculate transaction multiples and apply multiples to Peris financials/president transactions valuation range and adjust for Panera specific factors. Again here we go. Here's all the data. Um so yeah this is a little bit um different from the last one. So hypothetical president transactions data all given and hypothetical. Um calculate transaction multiples determine the median multiples. Um it gets Panera's financials from information store applies multiples to Panera's financials. um enterprise value um it takes the average repriator EV EBITA establishes um transactions valuations range um and then combines everything into the um little data down here. So your transactions median 11.43 43 um transactions median revenues two um estimated enterprise value the estimated enterprise value under revenue um value under present transactions and then the um transactions EV range is 9 to 11 million so then synthesizing um all that data so here it is so it's going to store all the information um calculate the um enterprise value. Determine financial buyer bid range. Estimate the strategic buyer bid range with synergies. Convert to equity value bid range. Establish overall bid range. Store all that bid range. So here is the next part. Um so retrieves the valuation results, retrieves valuation ranges for potential use and weight average. Um calculates the unlevered enterprise value. Determines financial buyer bid range. um established your buyer bid range and then convert to equity value bid range and then establish overall bid range and then store all that bid range. So here's all the data stored. So yeah. Okay, I'm like I thought it wasn't that. Um DCF enterprise range is around 9 million. Okay, 9.9 million. Um trading comps enterprise 17.3 million. um president transactions 1142.86\n\nmillion. The average base enterprise uh financial buyer um enterprise value bid range is from 12 to 13 million. Estimated synergy value 67 um 50 million. Strategic buyer enterprise value bid range is from 12 to 13 million. Financial buyer equity bid range um and then strategic buyer equity value bid range. and then it stores all the information. So final task um is just summarizing all the data or all the results. So here's so this is your DCF analysis valuation um and then the derived equity value um trading comparables analysis valuation um the estimated equity value from trading comparables um double checking my time. Yeah. um present transactions analysis valuation overall base enterprise valuation financial buyer KKR bid range um sorry from here and then the corresponding which is here strategic buyer bid range so here we go and then estimated EV bid range for strategic buyer and corresponding equity value bid range for strategic buyer. So then some insights and next steps. So the significant difference between evaluation range from the three methodologies highlights the sensitivity evaluation to assumptions and market context. Further investigation into the specific characteristics of the comparable companies and present transactions could help reconcile uh the differences or justify waiting strategy. So the absence specific net debt information means the calculated enterprise value are identical. So for more um precise valuation in mid-range determination obtaining and incorporating Panera's actual net debt um figures crucial as it directly impacts equity value and acquire would pay. So that was all the implements. So now we're in the validation. So this is going to be a lot of sensitivity analysis. So taking uh all that information and creating kind of different scenarios of what would we look like if we did this.\n\nSo first is implementing DCF the sensitivity analysis on DCF. So define ranges for the key drive drivers revenue growth WACCC terminal growth mean or rate. Now create a function to recalculate um DCF enterprise value for each combination of the sensitivity variables and store results in data frame. So here we are define the basic DCF parameters um the sensitivity ranges and then function to recalculate the DCF enterprise value for sensitivity. So this is going to be recalculating everything to fit the different scenario. So here is all the information. Um it does the terminal value using Gordon growth model. um exit multiple average them out perform sensitivity analysis and then this is the like library data they created. So um this is the DCF sensitivity analysis. So WCC at 0.08 terminal growth rate is at 2% revenue revenue growth rate 7% DCF enterprise value is 10475 10475.82 82 and then that just does um each year. I'm I'm guessing this is in the span of 26 years. Um so now the DCF sensitivity is complete. So now do the um trading comparable sensitivity analysis. So again same thing um except using the um trading comparable sensitivity or the data. So it defines the given information. It gets the financials um information and performs the sensitivity analysis. So again here is the sensitivity analysis for trading comparables um your EV/EDITDA multiple 17.23 PE multiple 28.33 estimated EV and then the equity value. So again this is I think it's span of like eight years. Um, and then so that was the trading comparable sensitivity. Now it's going to do the president transaction sensitivity. Again, I'm not going to go deep into it, but this is the sensitivity analysis that it gives for the um president um transactions. So now it's going to analyze the impact on bid ranges. Sorry, I I need a break. Um I was looking ahead to see. Okay, so the sensitivity analysis are completed and now it's going to reveal how changes in key drivers can significantly alter Cana bread's estimated value. So these insights directly influence the derived bid ranges for both financial and strategic buyers. So here we have the impact on DCF on bid ranges. So your revenue growth rate um DCF analysis show that higher initial revenue growth rates leads to a higher enterprise value. WACC um DCF is highest sensitive WACCC a lower WACCC um results in higher valuation suggesting a buyers with a lower cost of capital could justify a higher offer terminal growth rate. Higher terminal growth rate seemly increases the terminal value and thus the overall DCF valuation and then overall DCF impact. to the wide range of DCF values from the sensitivity analysis in indicates that KKR's bid range would need to account for its spending growth assumptions expected cost capital and long-term outlook. Next is the impact of trading comparable sensitivities on bid ranges. Um so this is the EV EVIDA multiples PC multiples and then Panera specific factors. I'm not going to get into it cuz I pretty much read for the DCF sensitivity. Um that's this is the trading comparable sensitivity and then the present transactions um sensitivities. So this would be the revenue and EBITDA multiples and the strategic versus financial buyer differences impact overall on the bid ranges. So the sensitivity analysis underscored that the final bid range for Panera Betta is not a static number but rather a function of various assumptions and market conditions. For KKR the bid range will be tethered to a robust financial model that can withstand different WACC growth scenarios ensuring their target IRRa is met. Okay. Okay. Um so now we're in the um conduct scenario analysis. So this is analyzing different scenarios for Panera's future performed based on various growth levers and market conditions. So quick instructions to find three distinct scenarios for Panera. uh free scenario recalculate the free cash flow for the five-year forecast period uh and terminal value based on the what the terminal value FCF for scenario determine the enterprise value present the um enterprise value for each scenario in a clear format and then store all that data. So here we are. So it redefineses the DCF calculations. It unpacks the scenario assumptions. Um it it gives the current revenue, growth rate, projected EBITDA, projected DA, projected CEX, all that stuff. Um it just gives all the projections, calculates terminal value, calculates the present value and define these scenario assumptions. So here is all of the data. It calculates DCF enterprise value for scenario. Presents the results and stores all the information. So here we go all that. So DCF enterprise value by scenario in millions. So optimistic is 14 uh 497.90 base is 911.92 and pessimistic is 6 and 871.78. So that is an optimistic positive approach. base and then pessimistic negative approach. So then now we're going to cross check with market reference points. So um first retrieve Panera's estimated enterprise and equity value, calculate the implied multiples, access market reference points, um compare and analyze and then summarize the findings. Um so here we go. So it retrieved all Panera's information, calculated the implied multiples, um accessed the market reference points, um compared and analyzed everything, and then it did a comparison the EV the enterprise value EV EBITDA um and then um comparison PE summarize the findings and discuss discrepancies. So here's all that. Um so here's the estimated so this is all um like given information um here's the implied information so market reference points all this is given comparison of Panera's implied multiple versus market reference so here is um Panera's implied EV/ EBITDA it's in line with the president so here and it falls in between both Um so then the implied 31.97 is a premium of the industries. Um implied is discount and Chipotles and then it is premium McDonald's. So comparing um each industry one's premium one's discount like seeing which one's better. So summary of the findings. So, um, Panera's invite, uh, EV/Ebita is within the president transactions range. Um, so it I I pretty much summarized it. This is pretty much the whole comparison. Um, so then it's going to review and refine the assumptions. So, first I'm going to review the results. Um, examine DCF scenario analysis, analyze, cross check against market reference. um based on these insights crit critically evaluate the initial base um case determine if any initial assumptions should be modified and then if I decide to refine any assumptions update the corresponding values which I did not. Um so then it just reviews all that information. So sensitiv sensitivity analysis results. Examine the scenario analysis results. Analyze mark market reference cross check critically evaluate the initial base case assumptions and then adjust the assumptions if necessary which again no. Um so that was pretty much summarization of everything. Um here's summarization of all the data that I was able to find. So the DCF valuation sensitivity um the trading comparable valuation sensitivity present transaction sensitivity DCF scenario analysis we got the optimistic base pessimistic market reference cross check um impact on bid range. So the analysis highlight that the final bid range is highly dependent on assumptions. Financial buyers like KKR uh will base their bids on robust financial models while strategic buyers might uh justify higher offers due to potential synergy realization potentially leading to wider bid ranges for strategic biders. Um so insights next steps. So the significant impact of key drivers um on valuation models necessities a careful review of base case assumptions um comparison uh against market benchmarks and competitor multiples provide crucial context.\n\nSo now we're in the evolve section. As you can see we're like got we've gone through a lot. Um okay so now we are going to identify value creation opportunities. So first um review the information, valuation insights, brainstorm opportunities by buyer type and category. So there's operational efficiencies, growth acceleration, financial structuring. Um so that's under the KKR financial buyer. So for strategic buyer um these are operational synergies, revenue synergies and then market expansion and then document document and prioritize. So um first game so wait oh yeah so sometimes it does this it'll show the same thing twice so um identify value creation opportunities so identify specific opportunities for KKR or strategic buyer to create additional value in Panera Bread. So access the information stores that I made um based on insights from PE DCF trading pretty much the um different transactions and comparables um it'll identify concrete value creation opportunities again for KKR for strategic buyer so um it'll implement instructions to identify value creation opportunities for both financial and strategic buyers based on provide details some information storage I made this involves defining opportunities qualitative and then storing them in the information storage excuse me. So this is from the information storage that I made and it continues to build up. So initialize the dictionary for value creation opportunities. Um KR financial buyer opportunities, big growth acceleration, um financial structuring, strategic buyer opportunities, um revenue synergies, growth acceleration and market expansion. Um so again, where was it? Um so this is for the KKR um which is the financial buyer and then this is all for strategic buyer. store the store the identify opportunities and then print the information. So this is all the information.\n\nYeah, it's a lot. So um next is refine the bid strategy and rationale. So this is um refining the proposed bid range and strategy by explicitly detailing the rationale for financial versus strategic buyer. So access the bid ranges review value calculation. Wow. Review value creation opportunities and formulate financial buyer rationale for KKR. Formulate strategic buyer rationale. Um present um refined bid ranges and then store the information. So again same thing accesses the bid ranges this time reuse the u value creation opportunities formulate the financial buyer KKR formulate the strategic buyer both of these ration and then um present the refined bid ranges store all that information. So here is all of that. Um next is quantify impact uh value creation opportunities. So this is translating the qualitative value creation opportunities into quantifiable financial impacts on Panera's future performance evaluation. So reviews the opportunities select key opportunities for quantification. So for financial it shows like um which opportunities under financial buyer strategic buyer um make assumptions. So for financial buyer um operational efficiency um growth acceleration and then for strategic buyer operational synergies revenue synergies calculate the u monetary impact um translate to incremental valuation so that's present present value of additional cash flows um terminal value impact sum of incremental values and a store the impacts all that information um okay so This is the one where the the code did fail and just tried it again. So here is all that. So choose the necessary data, get space projections under financial buyer, the assumptions and the growth acceleration. Um and then recalculate the F FCF. Okay, this is the hopefully final video. Um, so next is recalculating FCF for the KKR scenario. Applying additional revenue growth um the margin improvement applied to the new revenue. calculate the new EBIT TDA from base revenue and then assuming um DNA capeex changes are relative to the base revenue for simplicity um and then treat the incremental EBITDA as increment EBIT discount 2% value sum for the um value. So that was all for KKR. Now is the strategic buyer value creation is going to do the same thing except with um revenue synergies um cost savings additional revenue from synergies total increment cash flow discount to present value and sum for student buyer um store all that information and this is the final result for that. So increment SCFF for KO opportunities um is in this range right here. Total increment enterprise value for KKR is 83.34 million. That's on your financial buyer, strategic buyer. This is your range and then this is the um incremental enterprise value total. So quick summary of everything. So uh value creation opportunities identified. So this is for financial buyer and this is for strategic buyer. Um the refined bid strategy rationale for again um financial versus strategic buyer. Um the quantified impact value creation for financial versus strategic buyer. And then that was um all the um wow I'm blanking. Um\n\nthe the E for the driver method. Now we're on the last part which is reflection. So I'm not going to go too deep into this because it just reflects everything that it found or was given. Um again summarize the identify value creation because I pretty much went over everything. Um here's the summary for KKR strategic buyers implementations. um recommendation. So um this is formulating the recommendation for the very end which is I know a lot stores all the information. Um gives you proposed bid range the winning bid strategy. So um I know this is definitely summarized in better way but this is the recommendation at the end.\nSo um quick summary. So methodology summary um overall base enterprise value preliminary bid ranges value creation opportunities differentiation and recommendation. So KKO's proposed bid range for Panera Bet is set from 12 to 13 million for both enterprise and equity value. The recommended strategy emphasizes discipline valuation, aggressive operational value creation and highlighting KKR's operational expertise and track record negotiations. So insights next steps. So the significant difference in incremental value creation between financial and strategic buyers and uh dictates um distinct bidding strategies. Kr should highlight its operational excellence and long-term value creation plan to um compete against potentially higher offers from strategic buyers focused on synergy realization. Uh the negotiation strategy should actively leverage its commitment to Panera's brand equity, employee employee base and existing management using the detail value creation road map and management rollover um percentage to underpin discipline yet compelling offer. So that was everything. I know it was a lot. Um but I also relayed this through um Google Gemini and it gave me very similar results. Um, obviously not as accurate as Collab did, but it did give me some very similar results. I know this was very long. It probably shouldn't have been this long, but um, wow, it's snowing. It got to the point where I'm just I'm like, I just need to tell Collab personally how I want it to be done because it was just so much before and I would fight with it. I'm like, I just got to type it out. can't use like AI or anything to um like using chatbt or Gemini to plug in code. It's like it just never comes out right. So this time I personally typed the instructions um made its own um information store library so it can u go back take information so it knows what to do. But um that was pretty much it. This was my very last video and I really hope to get a good grade with this. Um overall in the end I definitely learned a lot about um kind of how to implement AI and collab together um which is something I've never done before before and then figuring out how to um figure out financial problems using collab and AI. Um I it used to be I instead of like being like asking AI to do something for me, I would just say what I wanted to do, not even ask. and how I literally ask it to do something a more polite way. Um but yeah, um this one I definitely it could have been better like there's definitely a better way of doing this. Um but I think this definitely summarizes everything very well. A I was able I feel like in the end from this I was able to learn how to give a specific instructions um while also providing many detail and also learning how to make a library or a system that stores all the information I gave so it can solve the problem and go back to that library for more information if needed. But yeah, thank you so much. Um, I very much enjoyed um, this semester in this class and um, I'm submitting a little bit early because I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Um, but yeah, I hope you enjoyed and I I say I hope I get a good Gary, which I really do, but I just want to end this off well. So thank you."
