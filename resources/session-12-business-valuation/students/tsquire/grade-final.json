  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines DCF as the present value of projected free cash flows, details the procedural steps (projecting FCFF, terminal value) and notes WACC components used to discount cash flows, plus performs sensitivity and scenario analyses. These elements show a thorough, applied introductory-level understanding, satisfying PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly identifies all FCF components (EBIT/EBITDA/dep’n, CapEx, change in NWC) and shows implemented FCFF calculations across forecast years and scenarios. It also uses unlevered free cash flow to derive enterprise value and discusses converting to equity value and buyer perspectives, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission includes explicit terminal value calculations by both growth (Gordon) and multiple methods with numeric outputs and an average TV. Sensitivity and scenario work directly acknowledge that terminal growth assumptions drive terminal value and materially affect overall DCF results, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual treatment of the EV→Equity bridge (handling net debt explicitly and noting its impact), but the submission lacks any explicit evidence of dividing equity value by share count to produce a price-per-share. Therefore the criterion is only partially met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used WACC as the discounting concept for FCFF and implemented it in the DCF with sensitivity testing (shows correct conceptual use). However, the submission does not provide a defensible derivation or industry benchmark justification for the chosen numeric WACC (8% is used without documented calculation or source), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
