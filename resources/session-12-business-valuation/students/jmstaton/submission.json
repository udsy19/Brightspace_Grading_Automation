  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and this is\nmy session 12 video assignment for\nfinancial management.\nSo, it gives us this scenario here. Itsays, \"Your private equity firm is\nelevating the acquisition of Cloud Tech\nSolutions and SAS company with promising\ngrowth but complex financials. The\nseller wants 500 million. Your managingpartner asks quote, \"Is this business\nworth the price\nand it gives us some info about theirfinancial profile?\"\nSo, their revenue, it says it's growing\n40% annually, but slowing to 25%\nexpected. Margins currently negative due\nto growth investments. Their customer\nbase is high retention but expensive\nacquisition costs and their market\nposition is strong in niche vertical uh\nfacing competition.\nSo,\nin summary, basically the that $500\nmillion price tag, I would say it's it's\nonly really justified if like the unit\neconomics were favorable.\nUm\nif it was like three times and the high\nretention was verified\nand the company is acquiring valuable\ncustomers even if it is expensive at the\nmoment.\nUh two, if the path to profitability is\nclear uh that you believe the company\ncan maintain its niche advantage or if\nyou sorry if uh your DCF model allows a\nstrong industic uh value based on\nrealistic uh margin expansion\nand three\nif the growth strategy is\nuh defensible\nthat you believe the company can\nmaintain its niche advantage and can\neffectively maintain the growth slow\ndown to achieve a sustainable scale."
