  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly defines the DCF as aggregating projected free cash flows discounted to present value and details how the discount rate (WACC) is computed and applied, plus runs sensitivity checks — meeting the introductory criterion with thorough, applied discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly spells out FCF components (NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, change in working capital) and describes the DCF construction using those cash flows. They also show translating EV to equity by subtracting net debt, demonstrating that the FCF/EV framework represents value available to capital providers; the Implement and Validate/Reflect stages support a thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly implements a Gordon-growth terminal value and computes an implied terminal multiple as a sanity check, plus a WACC×growth sensitivity analysis. The student also acknowledges the terminal value's dominant sensitivity and requires validation against market multiples, meeting the thorough conceptual and practical expectations for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit forecast period (five-year revenue growth) from a terminal period and implements a Gordon-growth terminal calculation with sensitivity across terminal growth and discount rates. However, they do not present explicit, reasoned short-term vs long-term numerical growth assumptions or a detailed justification that short-term rates are higher and long-term conservative—so the treatment shows correct conceptual structure and checks but is not fully thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly demonstrates subtracting net debt from EV to derive equity value and uses that in downstream outputs (PASS for the EV→Equity step). However, there is no explicit mention or calculation shown of dividing Equity Value by share count to produce a Price Per Share, so the full bridge requirement is only partially met.",
