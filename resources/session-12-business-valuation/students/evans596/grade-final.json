  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as the present value of future cash flows and explicitly uses a WACC (9%) in their model, with sensitivity analysis showing value changes when WACC moves. Multiple applied examples (base/upside/downside scenarios, numeric outputs) demonstrate a thorough introductory-level understanding, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used WACC as the discount rate in their DCF (explicit 9% WACC) and justified it as an industry-anchored input, implemented in their model, and tested sensitivities (10% WACC impact). While they did not show a full component-level WACC build-up, the conceptual use, defensible industry benchmark, and sensitivity analysis satisfy the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected an appropriate peer (Chipotle) and explicitly cited precedent multiples (12–15x) which, when applied to the stated EBITDA ($900M), yield the cited transaction range (10.8–13.5B). They integrated these comps into a broader valuation (\"football field\") and validated them against the DCF, demonstrating a thorough introductory comparable methodology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly anchors a DCF on EBITDA and uses WACC, indicating a conceptual grasp that cash flows are being valued for the firm (cash available to capital providers). However, they do not explicitly identify the core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or show adjustments from EBITDA to FCF, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student runs a DCF and reports outputs and sensitivities, but never explicitly calculates or describes a terminal value using a growth or multiple method, nor states that terminal value usually represents most of the DCF. Evidence shows DCF modeling (Implement) and reflection on sensitivities, but lacks the required explicit TV calculation and acknowledgement, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies scenario-based, short-term growth assumptions (e.g., 5% revenue growth, synergy-driven margin uplift) and uses modeling to test them, demonstrating understanding of multi-stage reasoning. However, they do not explicitly state an explicit forecast period length or a terminal (long-term) growth rate/transition specification, so treatment is correct but incomplete.",
