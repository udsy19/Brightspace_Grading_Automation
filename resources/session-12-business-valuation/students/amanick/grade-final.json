  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly builds an FCF-based projection and computes present values and a terminal value, and it specifies a WACC used for discounting, demonstrating correct DCF methodology. The combination of Implement and Define/Represent stages shows a coherent, applied understanding appropriate for introductory-level mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission both implements a terminal value calculation in the model and explicitly states that terminal value comprises the majority (~65%) of enterprise value, with sensitivity analysis around WACC/terminal g. This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly sets multi-year forecast paths with declining growth across scenarios, implements interpolation to transition to a terminal period, and validates the terminal's materiality (~65% of EV). These concrete assumptions, numbers, and checks demonstrate a thorough, reasonable treatment of multi-stage growth.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly models FCF from NOPAT and includes capex as a driver, showing functional understanding (Implement/Represent/Validate). However, it does not explicitly reference depreciation or working capital adjustments (or explicitly state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly used a WACC input (9%) and applied it in the DCF implementation (FCF → PVs → terminal value) and sensitivity analysis, satisfying correct application. However, they did not provide a defensible derivation or rationale for the 9% (no industry-average justification or component build-up), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently justified for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates conceptual and internal validation (sanity checks, cross-method triangulation, and consistency with sector multiples) but does not cite or compare to specific external sources/tools as required for a full PASS. Thus the evidence supports a partial fulfillment of the Validate criterion.",
