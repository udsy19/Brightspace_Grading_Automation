  "transcript": "# Session 12 — Video Script (≈7–8 min)\n\n## Opening (0:00–0:45)\n- Hook: \"KKR is weighing a bid for Panera—can we justify paying up when strategics are circling?\"\n- Explain mission: walk through DRIVER to triangulate DCF, comps, precedents, and synergies, ending with a bid strategy.\n- Preview agenda: Define mandate, map model, demo code, validate ranges, position financial vs. strategic bidders, conclude with recommendation.\n\n## D — Define & Discover (0:45–1:30)\n\n- State mandate: DRIVER-structured valuation with multi-scenario DCF, comps, precedents, synergy overlay, and football field.\n- Inputs: $6B revenue, $900M EBITDA, $400M net income, 2,100 stores, WACC 9%, industry multiples (P/E 22×, EV/EBITDA 12–15×).\n- Critical questions: EV range vs. multiples, financial vs. strategic posture, rollover implications, control premium thresholds.\n\n## R — Represent (1:30–2:15)\n\n- Walk through blueprint: Inputs → drivers → FCF engine → DCF scenarios → comps/precedents → synergy overlay → football field.\n- Highlight variable map (growth rates, margin targets, capex %, WACC, terminal g, net debt, shares).\n- Outline scenario architecture: base 8→6% growth, upside 10→7%, downside 5→4%.\n- Mention plan: parameter block, pandas outputs, bar/football charts, synergy calc, sensitivity grid.\n\n## I — Implement (2:15–4:15)\n\n- Show code structure:\n  - `project_scenario` using `np.linspace` for growth/margin paths, computing revenue, EBITDA, NOPAT, FCF, PVs, terminal value.\n  - Scenario loop storing EV/equity/per-share results.\n  - Trading comps & precedents DataFrames with implied EV.\n  - Synergy section: revenue uplift + cost saves valued at 12× EBITDA.\n  - Football field plotting code.\n  - WACC vs. terminal g sensitivity pivot.\n- Narrate results:\n  - DCF summary table: downside EV ~$9.8B, base ~$11.5B, upside ~$13.6B; terminal value ~65% of EV.\n  - Comps range ~$10–18B (Chipotle skew), precedents ~$10.8–13.5B.\n  - Synergy add-on ≈$3B EV for strategics.\n  - Football field visualization aligning methods.\n  - Sensitivity grid showing EV swings with WACC/g.\n\n## V — Validate (4:15–5:00)\n\n- Reiterate validation bullets:\n  - Smooth growth/margin transitions; FCF positive by mid-horizon.\n  - Multiples consistent with sector data.\n  - Synergy math ties to stated assumptions.\n  - Visual outputs (football field, sensitivity) match numeric tables.\n  - Equity bridge uses $2.5B net debt.\n\n## E — Evolve (5:00–6:00)\n\n- Discuss financial vs. strategic positioning:\n  - Financial buyer ceiling ≈$11.5B EV (12.5× EBITDA) to protect IRR.\n  - Strategics can stretch to $13.5B+ with synergies.\n  - Negotiation plan: open $11.0B, cap at $11.8B unless synergies verified; emphasize management rollover, speed-to-close, financing flexibility.\n- Note future enhancements: live API for multiples, scenario toggles in UI, synergy slider.\n\n## R — Reflect & Recommendation (6:00–7:15)\n\n- Share reflections:\n  - Integration of models reveals how different valuation lenses converge.\n  - Football field simplifies communication to investment committee.\n  - Sensitivity table underscores leverage of WACC/terminal g assumptions.\n- Final recommendation structure:\n  - Present DCF base/upside range, overlay comps/precedents.\n  - Define bid range $11.0–11.8B EV with walk-away at upside DCF.\n  - Plan messaging for strategic counterbids (synergy premium, integration risk).\n\n## Wrap (7:15–7:45)\n\n- Summarize outcome: clear bid strategy backed by multi-method analysis.- Tease Session 13: move from analysis to building AI-powered finance tools."
