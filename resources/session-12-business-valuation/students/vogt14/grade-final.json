  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames DCF as the present value of forecast free cash flows and states discounting at WACC, then demonstrates an applied discount (440M × 0.91743) using a 9% WACC. This shows correct conceptual understanding and basic practical application, meeting the introductory criterion thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a five-year explicit forecast and a terminal value, provides a reasonable declining multi-stage growth schedule (higher near-term, lower long-term), and links those assumptions to specific growth levers and sensitivity discussion. Coverage is concrete and applied in the model, satisfying thorough conceptual standards for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and cited PE and EBITDA multiple ranges, then applied those multiples to produce trading-comps and precedent EV estimates used in the bid range. The work is concrete (numeric multiples and resulting EVs) and integrated across DRIVER stages, satisfying an introductory comparable-methodology requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of DCF/FCF (projecting cash flows, discounting to enterprise value at WACC) and implemented a working model, which indicates understanding that FCF drives EV. However, they did not explicitly identify the standard FCF line-item components (EBIT/NOPAT, add-back depreciation, subtract CapEx and working capital) nor plainly state \"FCF = cash available to all providers of capital,\" so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value calculation (explicit growth method with a 3% terminal growth rate) and integrates it into EV in the implemented model, satisfying part of the criterion. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value usually represents the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding of adjusting EV with debt and cash to produce equity value and reports equity value ranges (evidence above), and implemented this in code. However, they do not show any calculation or mention of dividing equity value by share count to produce a price per share, so the bridge is incomplete. Hence PARTIAL.",
