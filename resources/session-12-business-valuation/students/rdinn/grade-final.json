  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models free cash flows, discounts projected cash flows at WACC, and adds a terminal value to produce enterprise value, demonstrating correct DCF mechanics. Scenario construction and WACC sensitivity checks show thorough, applied understanding at an introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models an explicit forecast period (multi-scenario projections) and separately computes terminal value, demonstrating the forecast vs terminal distinction. They also set and stress-tested reasonable long-term terminal growth assumptions (1–3%) while using scenario-based short-term projections, showing a solid, multi-stage growth reasoning.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used WACC to discount FCFF in the DCF cell and provided a defensible industry-average WACC (~9%) plus sensitivity analysis (8–10%), showing applied understanding and robustness. These elements satisfy the criterion at a thorough, applied level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows the student computes free cash flow and correctly discounts those flows at WACC to obtain enterprise value, indicating understanding that FCF is used for value to all capital providers. However, they do not explicitly identify or discuss the key FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) in the transcript, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly includes a terminal value calculation and treats terminal growth as a key, parameterized assumption (IMPLEMENT/EVOLVE). However, the student does not explicitly state that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so while the handling is correct and careful, the explicit acknowledgement required by the criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes and reports enterprise value and final bid/equity price recommendations, but the transcript contains no statement or code description that they subtracted net debt (or debt less cash) to derive equity value or that they divided equity value by share count to get price per share. Because the specific EV→Equity→Price-per-share bridge is missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
