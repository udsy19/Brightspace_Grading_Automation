  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly distinguishes an explicit forecast path (higher short-term growth of 8% tapering to 5%) from a lower terminal growth rate (2.5%) and links near-term growth to specific operational levers (new stores, digital mix). They also ran scenario/sensitivity analysis, showing a reasoned, multi-stage growth approach consistent with the DRIVER Discover→Implement stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected appropriate comparable peers (Chipotle, McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.) and explicitly applied valuation multiples (EV multiples, precedent multiples) to derive implied enterprise value ranges, with trading and precedent analyses integrated into their DRIVER valuation plan. This demonstrates a thorough introductory-level comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student triangulated valuation using multiple methods (DCF, trading comparables, precedents), reported numerical ranges for each, performed sensitivity analysis, and synthesized these into a justified 12–13bn EV recommendation—demonstrating thorough, coherent treatment of valuation triangulation and sensitivity.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies DCF inputs and explicitly uses a WACC (9%) and terminal growth to produce enterprise values, showing correct conceptual use of discounting future cash flows. However, they do not articulate the DCF definition as the present value of future free cash flows nor show detailed cash‑flow derivation or discounting steps, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows partial understanding by including capex, tax rate and operating margin in DCF assumptions and running multi-scenario DCFs (IMPLEMENT). However, they do not explicitly identify key FCF components such as EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, or changes in working capital, nor state that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a terminal growth rate (2.5%) in their DCF assumptions and runs sensitivity on terminal growth, and reports resulting enterprise values—evidence of a terminal value calculation and awareness of its impact. However, they do not explicitly explain the terminal value calculation method or state that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of enterprise value, so the treatment is correct but relatively brief.",
