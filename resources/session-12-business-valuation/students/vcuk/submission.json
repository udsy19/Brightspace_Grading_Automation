  "transcript": "0:02\nHello.\n0:03\nSo I'll be doing the session 12\n0:06\nassignment.\n0:10\nOkay. So it says assignment overview.\n0:12\ndeliver a full valuation of Perra for\n0:14\nperspective KKR take over using driver\n0:17\ncombined DCF creating comps and\n0:20\nprecedent transactions to produce an\n0:23\ninformed bid range while contrasting\n0:26\nfinancial buyer discipline with\n0:28\nstrategic buyer synergies.\n0:30\nSo\n0:33\nthe deal snapshot\n0:35\nis we have a scale of six six billion\n0:38\nrevenues\n0:40\ngrowing at 8% with $900 million\n0:43\na bid with 15% margin and 400 million\n0:47\nnet income across 2,00 stores and\n0:50\ndigital sales which already reach 50%.\n0:55\nAnd market references is industry PE of\n0:57\nroughly 22x president a bit of\n1:00\nmultipliers 12 to 15x Chipotle trades at\n1:03\n35x PE McDonald's at 25x capital\n1:06\nassumptions industry WCC 5% management\n1:10\nwants 10% rollover strategic strategic\n1:13\nbiders um which are Starbucks McDonald's\n1:16\nare circling growth le levers um 500 new\n1:20\nstores in 5 years digital mix to 70% um\n1:24\ndinner catering expansion early stage\n1:26\ninternational roll out\n1:28\nand so you made a Google slide and let's\n1:31\njust begin\n1:38\nokay so\n1:39\nwe first start start off by looking at\n1:41\nour agenda and our agenda is to define\n1:43\nand discover uh represent implement DCF\n1:46\ncomps presidents validate uh evolve bid\n1:50\nstrategy and the final recommendation\n1:55\nand define and discover the gay\n1:56\ncritical. So the objective is valid\n1:59\nPanera for KKR versus strategic buyers\n2:02\nand some information that we were given.\n2:05\nIt's the six billion revenue grow which\n2:07\nhas grown at 8% the $900 million at bid\n2:11\nwith 15% margin uh 2100 uh stores and\n2:15\nthe 50% digital sales uh and then manage\n2:19\nmanagement targeting 10% all over.\n2:23\nSo some key value drivers are the 500\n2:26\nnew stores over five years. There's\n2:29\ndigital penetration expanding to 70% and\n2:32\nthere's dinner and catering growth uh\n2:34\nand early international expansion or\n2:38\nexpansion\n2:40\nrepresent valuation plan. Um\n2:43\nso the plan is multi scenario DCF\n2:46\nuh which has three different things uh\n2:48\nwith the base upside and downside. Um\n2:51\nand there's a trading comparables\n2:53\nanalysis, president transaction\n2:55\nanalysis, football field valuation\n2:57\nsynthesis.\n3:00\nSo the DCF assumptions\n3:03\nis the revenue growth 8% tapering to 5%\n3:07\nuh the bida margin 15 15% to 17% uh the\n3:11\ncapeex of 5% of revenue a tax rate of\n3:14\n25% WACC of 9% terminal growth of 2.5%.\n3:19\nAnd so what we get from that is the\n3:22\nresults of a downside EV of roughly $6.5\n3:25\nbillion in a base EV\n3:29\nuh with approximately $8.6 billion\n3:33\nuh upside EV of\n3:36\n$10.1 billion or roughly $10.1 billion\n3:40\nuh which is which is a conservative\n3:42\nvaluation excluding synergies.\n3:44\nSo some trade some trade comparables are\n3:47\nwe can look at the peers like Chipotle,\n3:50\nMcDonald's, Starbucks, Yom, RBI, the EV\n3:53\nto the range of 13x to 16x the implied\n3:57\nand then in Panera there's the EV of\n4:00\n11.7 billion to 14.4 billion. Um the\n4:04\npresent transactions recent QSR fast\n4:07\ncasual buyouts the bida multiplies 12 to\n4:10\n15x the implied Panera EV\n4:14\nof 10.8 8 billion to 13.5 billion. So\n4:19\nthe football field summary has a DCF\n4:22\nanchors downside protection trading\n4:24\nclumps define market ceiling the\n4:26\npresidents\n4:28\nprecedents uh reflect control P\n4:31\npremiums. So the val the for the\n4:33\nvalidate sensitivity or some\n4:36\nsensitivities are um the plus and minus\n4:39\n1.1%\n4:40\n1% of the WCC which is um turned into\n4:45\nthe plus and minus of 12% EV and then we\n4:48\nthe terminal growth from 0 uh plus or\n4:51\nminus 0.5% to 8% EV the BPS margin from\n4:56\nplus 100 to plus uh $1 billion EV\n5:05\nAnd so if we look at the difference\n5:07\nbetween the strategic and financial\n5:08\nbuyers, the strategic the synergies or\n5:11\nthe yeah the synergies from the\n5:13\nstrategic side is there's a procurement\n5:17\nand supply chain from roughly $120\n5:20\nmillion to $150 million. Digital and loy\n5:24\nloyalty scale which is uh scaled at\n5:26\nabout 50 million to $75 million. a GNA\n5:31\nleverage of 30 to 30 to $50 million.\n5:36\nSo from the financial buyer or the KKR\n5:39\nperspective, there's a limited synergy.\n5:42\nIt focuses uh mainly on execution and\n5:46\nmargin discipline.\n5:48\nAnd the bid strategy is a there's a\n5:51\nopening bid at 11.5 billion, which is\n5:53\nroughly uh 12.8x of the AIDA. Uh there's\n5:57\na target range at 12\n6:00\nfrom 12 to$13 billion of EV the walk\n6:04\naway price of 13.2 $2 billion which is\n6:08\n14.7x of the AIDA and there's a moderate\n6:11\nleverage and 10% management rollover\n6:15\nand so the final recommendation and this\n6:18\nbasically the last slide KKR should\n6:20\npursue Panera aggressively but remain\n6:22\ndisciplined so a 12 to 13\n6:26\nbillion enterprise value maximizes risk\n6:29\nadjusted returns while avoiding\n6:31\noverpayment driven by speculative\n6:33\nstrategic synergies\n6:36\nIf we go back to\n6:40\nthings that is asking so we can if we\n6:42\nlook back at it it says deliver for\n6:44\nvaluation. So we did that. Um we this\n6:48\nwas the snapshot that we looked at. Um\n6:50\nand this is the\n6:53\nuh this is the framework that we use uh\n6:55\na driver.\n7:04\nOkay. So if we look at it carefully,\n7:09\nif we go back,\n7:13\nwe did these.\n7:25\nIt looks like we got everything. And uh\n7:26\njust to clarify once again about the\n7:28\nending or the conclusion is that KKR\n7:33\nwhich is the\n7:36\nthe financial buyers\n7:39\nthey they should pursue a aggressively\n7:41\nbut they should remain\n7:44\ndisciplined um and 12 to$13 billion\n7:47\nenterprise value maximizes risk adjusted\n7:49\nreturns while over avoiding overp\n7:51\npayment driven by speculative strategic\n7:52\nsynergy. So there's injuries that can\n7:54\nget that can get in the way of it and\n7:56\nthen if the financial buyers just pursue\n7:59\nit properly then should be fine as long\n8:02\nas they uh pursue it aggressively yet\n8:06\naggressively but stay disciplined and\n8:10\nnot um\n8:12\nnot over not over buy it and not overpay\n8:15\nfor\n8:17\nuh something that doesn't need to be\n8:18overpaid for."
