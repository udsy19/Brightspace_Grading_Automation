  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates a 5-year explicit forecast and a terminal (perpetual) value, provides specific short-term growth drivers and projected EBITDA ramp, and analyzes sensitivity to terminal growth. While they did not state an exact terminal growth rate, their modeling of explicit growth, downside/upside cases, and terminal sensitivity demonstrates a correct and sufficiently thorough multi-stage growth reasoning under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student selected appropriate peers and reported PE and EV/EBITDA multiple ranges, then applied those multiples to produce a trading-comps valuation range (11.8–17 billion) and compared it to other valuation methods. Coverage is clear and applied—sufficiently thorough for the introductory, moderate-standard criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student compares at least three methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions) with specific ranges and notes sensitivity to WACC/terminal growth, then triangulates results and selects a base DCF/bid range reflecting standalone vs. strategic value. This is a thorough, coherent treatment meeting the criterion for valuation triangulation and sensitivity.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct, basic understanding: they project free cash flows and a terminal value and state/use a WACC (9%), and interpret a DCF-derived enterprise value. However the treatment is descriptive rather than thorough (no explicit walkthrough of discounting mechanics or in-depth linkage that DCF = present value of projected FCFs), so this meets a correct but basic level (PARTIAL).\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references free cash flow and its role in valuation (notably that financial buyers focus on FCF), but they do not explicitly identify or discuss FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or show how FCF was constructed. This demonstrates correct but basic/partial understanding, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies a terminal value via the perpetual growth method and ran it in their DCF (Implement). They also discuss sensitivity to terminal growth/WACC, implying terminal value materially affects total EV (Reflect). However, they do not explicitly state that terminal value represents the majority of value or quantify TV as a percent of EV, so treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",
