  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames a DCF that projects free cash flows and includes a terminal value, and they state and use a WACC (9%) and sensitivity testing on WACC/terminal growth. The implementation, representation, and validation stages show a thorough introductory treatment of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly implements a terminal-value calculation (perpetuity terminal growth with stated WACC and 2–3% terminal growth) and performs sensitivity testing. The student also clearly acknowledges that terminal value comprises roughly 60–80% of DCF value and discusses its sensitivity, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast from a lower long-term terminal growth rate and provides concrete, reasonable growth ranges (base/upside/downside) plus terminal assumptions and sensitivity testing. This detailed, scenario-based treatment demonstrates a strong, thorough grasp of multi-stage growth reasoning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key FCF inputs (capex, working capital, margins/EBITDA) and integrates FCF into a firm-level DCF with WACC, showing conceptual grasp. However they do not explicitly mention depreciation or NOPAT nor clearly state that FCF is cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computes enterprise-value ranges and a recommended transaction price (Represent + Implement), but there is no explicit equity-value bridge: no subtraction of net debt (or debt less cash) from EV and no division by share count to produce a price-per-share. Given the criterion requires those explicit steps, the submission fails to demonstrate them.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal sanity checks (sensitivity analysis) and cross-checked results against market comps and precedent transactions, showing conceptual external validation. However, they did not name specific external sources, tools, or data providers (e.g., particular databases or websites), so under the moderate standard this meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
