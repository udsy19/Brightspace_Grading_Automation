  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (operating profit after tax/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, change in working capital) and applies that formula across downside/base/upside scenarios (Implement/Discover). They also connect FCF-driven DCF to enterprise value and valuation decisions, demonstrating understanding that FCF underpins value to capital providers.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (McDonald's, Chipotle) and applied an EBITDA multiple range (12–15x) to Panera's stated EBITDA ($900M), demonstrating correct comparable methodology and practical application consistent with the Implement stage. Coverage is clear and appropriate for an introductory/moderate expectation, satisfying the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly triangulated valuation by running a DCF with downside/base/upside scenarios and separately analyzing trading comparables and precedent-transaction EBITDA multiples, provided EV ranges, and recommended the base-case DCF as the most reasonable anchor—meeting the criterion with sufficient depth.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct conceptual use of free cash flows and applies a DCF to produce scenario enterprise values, with DRIVER IMPLEMENT and REFLECT stages evident. However, it lacks explicit discussion or specification of the discount rate (e.g., WACC) or the mechanics of discounting, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly includes a terminal value step in the DCF and produces scenario enterprise values (Implement/Discover stages), but they do not state which TV method (perpetuity growth vs. exit multiple) nor acknowledge that terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value. Coverage is correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student establishes explicit multi-year projections (margins transitioning by year five) and distinct short-term growth rates across downside/base/upside, showing correct multi-stage thinking. However, they do not specify terminal growth assumptions or explicitly justify a lower long-term growth rate, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
