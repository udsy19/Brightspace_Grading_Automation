  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Aaron Grahovski. This is\nmy session 12 assignment um analyzing\nthe business evaluation using the driver\nframework. I'm going to value Panera\nBread for a potential KKR or take\nprivate and I'll do it in three layers.\nA multi scenario DCF, a trading comps\ntriangulation, and a precedent\ntransactions triangulation. Then I'll\noverlay a strategic synergy case, run\nsensitives, and finish with a discipline\nbid strategy.\nSo starting off is our define section um\nwhere we need to decide what we're\nactually solving and that's the question\nof should KKR buy Panera and if yes\nwhat's the highest price KKR can pay and\nstill earn an attractive return and\nbecause strategic buyers may also bid\nthe second part of the decision is how\nfar can a strategic buyer go above a\nfinancial buyer based on synergies and\nwhere should KKR walk away.\nOur Next part is discover still include\nin the D aspect of our driver and this\nis where I identify the assumptions that\ndrive value the most for Panera bread.\nThe biggest drivers are revenue growth,\nEBITDA margin, capital intensity meaning\ncapex and working capital and then the\ndiscount rate or WACC. I'm using the\nassignment starting point. Revenue is $6\nbillion growing at around 8% and EBITDA\nis 900 million which is about 15%\nmargin.\nI also model five years explicitly\nbecause the capstone asks for fiveyear\nprojections and then I compute a\nterminal value beyond that.\nAnd we can see all of those assumptions\nas I've just outlined right here.\nUm to reflect the level uncertainty I'm\nnot using just one set of assumptions.\nI'm using three scenarios, downside,\nbase, and upside. And each one has\ndifferent growth path, margin path,\nWACC, and terminal growth weight. And\nyou can see those three different\nscenarios right here.\nAnd you can see their applications down\nhere as well.\nThe next step is our represent stage. So\nI'm going to explain how the model\nstructure operates before I run it. And\nyou can see all of the output. So you\ncan see that this model has a clean\nflow. First I project revenue each year\nand apply an EBITDA margin to compute to\ncompute it. Uh second I convert E EBITDA\nto EBIT by subtracting depreciation\namortization. Third I compute NOPAT\nwhich is after tax appreciating profit.\nAnd finally I calculate unlevered free\ncash flow which is NOPAT plus\ndepreciation minus capex minus the\nchange in networking capital.\nThen I discount those free cash flows\nusing WACC and I add a turn of value\nusing the Gordon growth method.\nAnd you can see all of that being done\nhere in the core financial functions\nwhere I'm using all of those values that\nI just mentioned and I'm calculating\nexactly what I need. So in the code you\ncan see free cash flow being built line\nby line revenue EBITDA DNA EBIT NOPAT\ncapex working capital change and then\nfree cash flow. Then the DCF function\ndiscounts those cash flows and creates\nthe terminal value that we are looking\nfor. You can see all of that is\nhappening right here.\nAnd the next step is to actually\nimplement this where we run the model\nthat we've just built and we interpret\nthe outputs.\nUm, and the results of the DCF can be\nseen and all of that built is being run\ndown here. And we can see the results\ndown here at the bottom.\nSo starting with the DCF section, the\nmodel prints enterprise value for each\nscenario. Downside, base, and upside.\nDownside has slower growth and a higher\ndiscount rate, so it provides the lowest\nEV. Base uses an industry like WACC and\nmodest margin expansion. Upside assumes\nstronger growth and better margin, so it\nproduces the highest EV.\nUm, one important validation metric\nprinted here is the percent of\nenterprise value coming from the\nterminal value. If terminal value\ncompletely dominates, that tells me I\nneed to double check whether my long run\nassumptions are too aggressive.\nAnd you can see the summations of\neverything I just discussed, all of\nthose values that we calculated all\nbeing printed out through here. We can\nsee the downside DSF, base DSF, and\nupside DSF with all of those little\nvalues put. We got the training camps\nhere, precedent transactions, strategic\nsynergy, overlay, summary ranges, and\nthen at the bottom, the base case\nsensitivity, EV, WACCC times, terminal\nG, of course.\nUm,\nthe next part is trading comps. Here I\nuse P and E multiples as valuation acres\nincluding the industry multiples and the\nreference and the reference companies to\nestimate equity value from net income.\nAnd then I bridge from equity value to\nenterprise value using net debt.\nThen I use precedented transactions. The\nassignment gives a precedent EBITDA\nmultiple range of roughly 12 to 15\ntimes. I apply that to Panera's EBITDA\nto produce an implied enterprise value\nrange. Um then I overlay the strategic\nbuyer case. A strategic acquirer might\njustify paying more because they can\nrealize synergies. I model a synergy ei\nrange haircut it by a capture rate to be\nassertive and capitalize it into a\npotential EV uplift\nand you can see all of that here.\nNow we must validate this. So I bring\nall the methods together and check\nwhether the valuation ranges tell a\nconsistent story. I compare the DCF\nrange, the trading comp range, the\nprecedent range. I also compute a\nfinancial buyer lane, basically the\noverlap region I can offend without\nrelying on synergies. And then I a\nstrategic lane by adding synergy uplift.\nAnd you can see right here where we have\nthe summary ranges EV. I then visualize\nthat triangulation using a football\nfield chart which you can see right\nhere. We have our precedent, our trading\nPE, financial buyer and strategic buyer\nlane all relative to the evaluation.\nUm the next step is our evolve section\nof our interpretation. So I stress test\nthe valuation so I'm not relying on one\nset of assumptions. First I run a\nsensitivity table in WACCC and terminal\ngrowth because those are typically the\ntwo biggest valuation levers. Then I run\na synergy capture sensitivity to show\nhow strategic values change if synergy\nrealization is more or less certain. And\nyou can see that with the\nprinted uh base case sensitiv base case\nsensitivity which is right here.\nAnd as expected a higher WACCC reduces\nenterprise value and higher terminal\ngrowth increases enterprise value.\nAnd the last section of our driver\nevaluation is to reflect. This is where\nI turn valuation into a decision. As a\nfinancial buyer, I anchor my bid to the\ndefendable lane that's supported by\nintrinsic cash flows and deal pricing\nreality. Meaning the DCF and precedented\ntransactions overlap. I do not want to\npay the full strategic premium because\nsynergies are uncertain and often belong\nto a strategic buyer, not a private\nequity buyer. So my output is a clear\nbid strategy, an opening bid to anchor\nthe negotiation, a target zone where\nreturns can still work, and a walkway\nprice where the risk no longer justifies\nthe purchase.\nAnd that can be seen\nwhen we were discussing the bid strategy\nand and simple discipline link.\nAnd to wrap up, I follow the driver end\nto end. Define the decision, discover\nthe drivers, represent the model,\nimplement the valuation methods,\nvalidate the triangulation, evolve with\nsensitivities, and reflect with\ndiscipline bid recommendation. Thank you\nfor watching. This has been my session12 assignment."
