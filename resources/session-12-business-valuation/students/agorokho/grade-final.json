  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructs unlevered free cash flows and applies WACC to discount them, plus computes a Gordon-growth terminal value and sensitivity tests—demonstrating a thorough, correct introductory DCF methodology consistent with the DRIVER implementation and validation stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and implements unlevered free cash flow with the required components (NOPAT, depreciation, capex, change in working capital) and shows the calculation in code, demonstrating clear conceptual and practical understanding. Their use of intrinsic cash flows to set bid strategy further confirms they recognize FCF as the cash that underpins value available to capital providers.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates a terminal value (via the DCF/Gordon growth method) and implements it in code, and they also explicitly acknowledge and validate the share of enterprise value coming from terminal value and sensitivity to terminal growth. These show thorough conceptual and applied treatment, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly shows conceptual understanding of using net debt to bridge EV and equity (quote 2) and uses P/E to derive equity value (quote 1). However, they do not explicitly state the arithmetic direction (subtracting Net Debt from EV to get Equity Value) nor explicitly mention dividing Equity Value by share count to obtain Price Per Share, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies multiples (P/E and a 12–15x EBITDA precedent) and bridges equity to enterprise value, demonstrating method application (Represent/Implement). However, they do not explicitly name or show selected comparable peers (e.g., Chipotle, McDonald's), so peer selection is not clearly documented—hence PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the valuation object (Panera) and acquisition context and names KKR as the financial buyer, meeting part of the requirement. However, they do not explicitly identify \"Management\" as a stakeholder (only financial/strategic buyer perspectives are named), so the criterion is only partially satisfied under the strict DRIVER standards.",
