  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames a forward-looking DCF that projects free cash flows and deducts capex, and repeatedly uses WACC scenarios (including sensitivity) to derive present valuations. These combined DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stage elements demonstrate correct and applied understanding of DCF methodology at an introductory level, meriting PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year explicit forecast (6% growth) from terminal assumptions and tests multiple terminal-growth scenarios, showing reasonable higher short-term vs lower long-term growth. The use of sensitivity analysis and parameterized DCF demonstrates thorough, applied multi-stage growth reasoning aligned with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulates valuation (DCF vs. relative comps and precedents), reports numeric outcomes (DCF floor 10.5B; comps/precedents and strategic ceiling ~12.4B), and runs sensitivity analyses that produce a value range which informs a reasoned mid‑point bid—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references key FCF elements (NOPAT and CapEx) and applies them in a DCF (Implement), showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not mention depreciation or changes in working capital nor explicitly state that FCF represents cash available to all capital providers, so coverage is incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly incorporates a terminal growth parameter in the DCF and tests its impact, showing conceptual use of a terminal value driver. However, they do not show an explicit terminal value calculation method (growth vs. multiple) nor explicitly acknowledge that the terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents EV-level valuations and a recommended bid using DCF and comps (Implement) but never shows subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to convert EV to Equity Value nor dividing by share count to derive a price per share. Because both required bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not met.",
