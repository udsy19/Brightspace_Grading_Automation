  "transcript": "Hello. Today I'm going to be talking\nabout u Panera Bread's valuation. I'm\ngoing to start off with the define and\ndiscover. And in this area, the input\nparameters, also known as the define and\ndiscover stage. Our objective is to\ndeliver an executive ready build bid for\nPanera to KKR.\nThe constraint is balancing KKR's\nfinancial discipline, which is 9% WACCC\nagainst strong strategic buyer interest.\nWe have to justify a bid range between\nthe financial floor as well as the uh\nstrategic ceiling.\nUm three of the valuations that we're\ngoing to be using here. So our plan is a\ntriangulation approach. We're going to\nstart with a forward looking DCF and\nkind of sanity check it with a relative\nvaluation. So PE and EBITDA multiples\nand then apply potential synergies to\ndefine that strategic ceiling.\nThen implement stage it's going to be\nseen down here and this uh all of this\nis going to be seen in the implement\nstage\nand basically uh this this base DCF\nuses a 6% growth leveraging the digital\nand store expansion layers and we\nproject the FCF over 5 years calculating\nthe NOAT and then deducting capex for\nexpansion. This results in a financial\nbuyer valuation floor of 10.5 billion.\nMoving on\num this kind of more the implement phase\nas well. This is going to be the run\nvaluation and strategic um bid function.\nSo this relative valuation confirms our\nfloor. So the trading comps uh give 8.8\nbillion to 14 billion and the precedent\nM&A deals uh place core value range at\n10.8 billion to 13.5 billion. The\naverage precedent transaction value is\n12.2. two\nkind of validating this. We're going to\ngo down here to uh calculate the\nstrategic bid.\nA strategic buyer such as McDonald's may\nbe cap capturing a $150 million annual\nsynergies and can justify a ceiling up\nto 12.4 billion. So this gap represents\nthe required control premium KKR must\npay to win.\nAnd then this is a kind of a critical\ncheck. We're just going to rerun the DCF\nwith a manual WACC change that's down\nhere. Um, this model is parameterized\nfor a quick validation. So, if KKR's\nWACCC rises to 10%, our DCF value drops\nto 9.6 billion. A critical data point\nfor that walkway price.\nMoving on to this analysis here, we're\ngoing to go down to table. This is a\nlittle heat map here. So we use the\nsensitivity analysis to evolve our\nunderstanding. This heat map shows that\nif WACCC is 10% and terminal growth is\nonly 1.5%\nthe value falls to 9.3 billion. So if\nour execution is perfect 9% WAC 2.5%\nTG then that value is going to be 11.6\nbillion. And then moving further into a\nfootball chart we have down here.\nSo this kind of uh shows our analysis\nand it triangulates the value between\n10.5 billion which is the DCF\num to about 12.4 billion which is that\nstrategic ceiling. So final\nrecommendation here\nuh based on the valuation and strategic\npositioning\nuh we recommend KKR's winning bid\nstrategy. We recommend bid of 11.8\nbillion. Um this represents 3 point or\n13.1 times eBida uh placing it above the\naverage precedent or yeah precedent\nmultiply multiple and ensuring KKR\noutbids financial peers. It leaves about\n600 million of upside potential before\nhitting that strategic ceiling which\nprotects KKR from required IRR. And some\nof the rational behind this is that KKR\nis discipline and we're basing our\nprimary value on the cash flows\ngenerated by the existing business and\nachievable growth, not the speculative\nsynergies. So require 10% management\nrollover incentives. Um this kind of\nmanaged to hit the upside case aligning\nwith KKR's PE model. And then the\nwalkway price is going to be 12.2\nbillion. uh bidding higher than this\nmeans that accepting too much execution\nrisk for the remaining irr. So given the\nsensitivity results so our final is just11.8 8 billion bid"
