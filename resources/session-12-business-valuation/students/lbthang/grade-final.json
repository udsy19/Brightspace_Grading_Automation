  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as the method to value future cash-generating activities, models free cash flows from EBITDA adjustments, specifies and applies a WACC to discount/value the cash flows, and conducts sensitivity analysis—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a passing introductory-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and applied an EV/EBITDA multiple (12–15x) to derive an implied enterprise value range (10.8–13.5B). They also reflected on how that range compares to their DCF, demonstrating correct and adequate application of the comparable methodology for an introductory level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly triangulated multiple valuation methods (DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions), reported numeric ranges from those methods, and discussed sensitivity to WACC and what valuations would erode returns, culminating in an advised bid range. This demonstrates a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct elements—starting from EBITDA, adjusting for taxes and capex, and using DCF to produce enterprise value—indicating awareness that FCF drives value to capital providers. However, they do not explicitly mention key FCF components such as depreciation/Amortization or changes in working capital nor reference EBIT/NOPAT terminology, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a clear Terminal Value calculation and method (Implement), satisfying half the criterion. However they do not explicitly state that the Terminal Value comprises the majority of DCF value; only a brief reflective comment implies awareness of TV-driven risk. This shows correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguishes an explicit forecast (8% growth) from a terminal period (3%) and implements the terminal via the Gordon growth method, showing reasonable short‑ vs long‑term rates. However, the treatment is brief—lacking detailed multi‑stage timing/taper logic and fuller justification—so it meets the criterion only partially.",
