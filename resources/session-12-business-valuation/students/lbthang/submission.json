  "transcript": "0:02\nHi, my name is Law and for today's video\n0:07\num we're on session 12 business\n0:10\nvaluation and financial modeling and we\n0:13\nare on section six\n0:16\nassignment comprehensive business\n0:19\nvaluation. Our assignment overview is\n0:22\ndeliver a full valuation of Panera Bread\n0:26\nfor a prospect\n0:28\nprospective\n0:31\nuh KKR takeover using driver.\n0:35\ncombine DCF trading camp comps and\n0:39\npercentage transitions to provide an\n0:41\ninformed bridge bid range while\n0:44\nconcentrating financial buyer discipline\n0:46\nwith strategic\n0:48\nbuyer synergies\n0:51\nsynergies.\n0:52\nOkay. So our deal Snapchat is our we\n0:56\nhave our scale this 6 billion revenue\n0:59\ngrowing at 8% 900 million EBITDA 15%\n1:04\nmargin 400 million network income across\n1:09\n2,100 stores digital sales already by\n1:13\n50%.\n1:14\nAnd we have our market reference our\n1:17\ncapital assumptions and our growth\n1:19\nlevers.\n1:21\nSo our job is our assignment is to\n1:24\ncreate an executive ready recommend\n1:27\nrecommendation that states your\n1:28\nvaluation range, winning bid strategy\n1:31\nand rational\n1:34\nrationale\n1:37\num for choosing financial versus\n1:39\nstrategic positioning\n1:42\nand to in our we'll be using the driver\n1:47\nframework requirement. Start with define\n1:49\nand discover. Map your planet and\n1:51\nrepresent then execute through implement\n1:53\nand validate. Evolve, reflect, capture\n1:56\nevidence as work progress rather than\n1:57\nsummarizing after the fact.\n2:00\nOkay.\n2:03\nSo\n2:06\nI am going to be presenting the buy side\n2:09\nvaluation for Panera Bread as we read.\n2:13\nSo we are evaluating a potential 12 to\n2:16\n14 billion take private deal. I will use\n2:20\nthe driver framework to analyze the\n2:23\nintrinsic value and determine if we can\n2:25\nwin against um strategic biders like\n2:30\nStarbucks.\n2:32\nOkay. So let's go to my notes.\n2:36\nStarting with the discover. Um, Panera\n2:39\nis a strong asset with 6 billion in\n2:42\nrevenue and 900 million in Ebitda.\n2:46\nThe growth story is solid\n2:50\nwith 50% digital sales with a plan to\n2:54\nopen 500 new stores. The core retention\n2:57\nhere is buyer type as KKR. Um, we need\n3:02\nan irr of 20% plus. However, um\n3:07\nstrategic buyers can pay more because\n3:10\nthey realize synergies we need to um to\n3:15\nfind a price that works for our returns\n3:17\nbut is competitive enough to win.\n3:22\nAll right. Okay. So, moving to our\n3:25\nrepresent\n3:27\nto find the fair price. I am\n3:31\ntriangulating three methods. First is\n3:35\nDCF to capture the value of the new 500\n3:40\nstores and margin expansion.\n3:43\nSecond, trading comps um looking at\n3:45\npeers like Chipotle and McDonald's.\n3:48\nThird is to\n3:51\nprecedented transitions applying a 12 to\n3:54\n15 times\n3:57\nEbitda\n3:58\num multiple base on historical\n4:01\nrestaurants. M&A\n4:04\nthis creates our um a view of our\n4:08\nvaluation.\n4:12\nOkay. So for the implement\n4:16\num I am going to use Python or Google\n4:18\nCollab\n4:21\nto implement it. So,\n4:25\nuh, I've for on my input, um, I've\n4:29\nmodeled revenue growing at 8%\n4:33\nat 8% tampering down to a, um, terminal\n4:37\nrate of 3%. I've assumed margins expand\n4:41\num, slightly from 15% to 16.5\n4:46\ndue to digital um, efficiencies.\n4:50\nand I'm using 9% uh WAC.\n4:55\nThe code calculates uh free cash flow by\n4:58\nadjusting EBITDA\n5:02\nfor taxes and necessarily um capex for\n5:06\nthe new stores. The terminal value I'm\n5:09\nusing the Gordon growth method\n5:13\nis and so that's what I'm using for the\n5:16\nterminal value. And if we\n5:19\nrun the code and click play,\n5:24\nit should Yep. So, we got a check mark.\n5:26\nSo, it's good.\n5:30\nAnd to validate our inputs, um, we check\n5:33\nthe numbers. The DCF gives us a base\n5:36\nenterprise value of roughly around 9.7\n5:40\nmillion.\n5:42\nComparing this to the market um the\n5:45\nprecedent transition at\n5:48\n12 to 15 times\n5:51\nAB ITDA imply a range of\n5:56\n10.8\n5:58\nbillion to\n6:00\n13.5. Our DCF is at the top of the end\n6:04\nof historical deals. This implies we are\n6:08\npaying for future perfection.\n6:11\nAnd my sensitivity table shows us that\n6:14\nif WAC\n6:16\na WACCC\n6:19\ngoes to 10% value drops to 11\n6:25\nbillion which is a significant risk\n6:28\nand so that is pretty much it for the\n6:31\nimplement. And going back to our\n6:37\nevolve here.\n6:39\nUm\n6:41\nso to evolve the strategy, how do we\n6:44\nbeat a strategic buyer? Um a strategic\n6:49\nlike Starbucks could pay 15 billion\n6:51\nbecause they can cut overlapping supply\n6:54\nchains.\n6:56\nUm we can't do that. However, our edge\n6:59\nis the management rollover. Management\n7:03\nmanagement wants to stay involved.\n7:05\nStrategics usually replace management\n7:08\nby offering Panera's leadership a chance\n7:11\nto roll 10% of their equity into the\n7:15\ndeal. we uh align\n7:19\nincentivists\n7:21\nand become the partner of choice even if\n7:24\nour bid is slightly over for our evolve.\n7:30\nSo speed of um execution and allowing\n7:34\nmanagement to\n7:37\nretain equity upside down for our for\n7:41\nour edge or evolve. And to reflect\n7:45\noverall, um, so to reflect and conclude,\n7:50\nI recommended, um, KKR submit an opening\n7:53\nbid of\n7:57\n12.5 billion with a ceiling of 14\n8:01\nbillion. Anything above 14 billion\n8:04\nerodess our private equity returns. Our\n8:08\npitch is not just price. It's the\n8:13\npartnership model with management to\n8:16\nexecute the digital um ex expansion and\n8:21\nexit in five to seven years.\n8:24\nSo that is it pretty much for our flip.\n8:28\nLet's double check and see our\n8:32\nrequirements.\n8:34\nBuild a multi scenario. Okay. Base\n8:37\nupside down. Okay. We got that. Run a\n8:41\ncomparable company.\n8:44\nOkay. Did that.\n8:48\nWe did that.\n8:52\nTriangulate the approach f.\n8:54\nOkay.\n8:56\nWe did that. So the football field was\n8:58\nlike the the beginning during the\n9:02\nthe define and we use Python.\n9:06\nOkay.\n9:09\nAll right. So I think we pretty much did\n9:11\neverything.\n9:13\nSo 50 points for\n9:16\naccuracy,\n9:18\nconcept accuracy, technical implements.\n9:22\nYes.\n9:27\nYes.\n9:30\n306 stage.\n9:32\nYes.\n9:37\nAll right. Okay. I think that will be it\n9:40for my video. Thank you."
