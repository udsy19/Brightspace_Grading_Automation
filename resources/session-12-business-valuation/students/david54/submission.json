  "transcript": "Hello. For this assignment, I'm acting\nas an analyst for KKR,\na financial sponsor. My objective is\nto build a valuation model for Panera\nBread to determine a winning bid price\nfor the offer\nprice that offers a strong return for\nour investors while competing against um\nour strategic buyers like McDonald's. To\nensure this analysis is rigorous, I am\nusing the driver framework. I have built\nthis Python script\nto document my process in defining\nthe inputs and involving the final\nrecommendation.\nso let's walk through the step one by\none.\nPhase one is the define and discover.\nhere I will translate the case studies\ndetails into variables that can model\nits process. we have the 9 million in\nLMT ebitda\nwhich is our starting point for cash\nflow. I have set the growth rate at\n8%. This is a critical assumption based\non the case studies mentioned of our 500\nnew stores and 50% digital sales mix. I\nhave defined the WACC at 9% which acts\nas a discount rate for the DCF.\nbelow that is the multiples\ndictionary. I've captured the market\ncontext. precedent transactions what\nother buyers have paid for similar\nchains from range from 12x to 15x\nebitda.\nWe also see trading peers like Chipotle\ntrading um massive\npremiums like 35x P/E\nwhich suggests the market is willing to\npay up for growth. Defining these\nvariables up front allows me to\neasily run sensitivity analysis later\nwithout rewriting the whole code.\nMoving to the represent implement phase,\nI chose to use a discounted cash\nflow model as a primary tool because we\nneed to understand the intrinsic value\nof Panera's full growth, not just what\nthe market is paying today. I\nrepresented a logic and function\nand let me explain how it works. The\nloop simulates\nthe growth\nsimulates the next five years of\noperations growth and deterioration. And\nI multiply the previous years eB\nplus the growth rate. This models the\ncompound effect of the new store's\nopening into discounting. I take the\nfuture cash flow and divide it by 1 +\nwacc raised to the power of the year.\nThis adjusts for the time value of\nmoney. $1 and year five is worthless.\nToday is $1. today. After the loop, I\ncalculate the terminal value.\nthis represents what we could call\nwhat we could sell Panera at at the end\nof year five. I'm assuming we can exit\nat 14x multiple, which is consistent\nwith the high end of current valuations.\nI\nwhen I run this function, the model\ninputs the intrinsic\nenterprise value of roughly 14.2\nbillion.\nhowever the DCF is theoretical when we\nneed to ground in reality. in this\nnext section I implement the\nthe comparable company analysis to build\na valuation floor and ceiling. I'm\ncalculating the values based on the\nprecedent multiples we discovered\nearlier. A low case is 12x gives us a\nvaluation of roughly 10.8 billion. The\nhigh cases at 15x gives us 13.5 billion.\nThis creates conflict. My DCF at 14.2\nbillion is higher than the historical\nmarket range of 13.5 billion which\nsuggests that Panera's sign specific\ngrowth plan digital plus catering might\nbe worth more the average historical\ndeal. But as a disciplined financial\nbuyer, paying above historical multiple\nis multiples is risky.\nthis leads us to the validate\nphase which is arguably the most\nimportant part of the analysis. I need\nto stress test my assumptions against\nthe competitive landscape. Here I am\nmodeling the strategic buyer threat.\ncompetitors like McDonald's have\nfive synergies. They can merge supply\nchains and cut duplicate corporate\ncosts. I've estimated these synergies at\n100 million per year. When you add that\n100 million to Panera's EBITDA,\na strategic buyer essentially sees a 1\nbillion dollar company, not a 900\nmillion one.\nThis means McDonald's can bid up to 15\nbillion and still achieve the same\nmultiple we do. The valuation the\nvaluation finding. My code confirms that\nwe cannot win a bidding war on\nprice alone. If we try to outbid\nMcDonald's ,dollar for dollar, we will\ndestroy our returns. This validation\nstep forces us to change up our\nstrategy. And based on the value\nvalidation, I can evolve this\nrecommendation.\ninstead of bidding the full DCF\nvalue of 14.2 billion, I'm recommending\na bid of 13.8 billion. Why 13.8 8\nbillion. Uh for the financial\ndiscipline, it implies an entry multiple\nof 15.3x.\nThis is aggressive, but it's supported\nby the 8% growth in a high digital mix.\nIn the strategic positioning, since we\ncan't beat McDonald's 15 billion\ncapacity, we must offer something else.\nGovernance, I'm proposing we use the\nmanagement rollover as a key duriator.\nWe tell Panera's management, if you sell\nto McDonald's, you will get fired. If\nyou sell to KKR, you keep 10% ownership\nand run the show.\nto reflect to conclude this driver\nanalysis, it helped me move from a\nsimple math exercise to a strategic bid.\nWe used\nthe implement phase to find intrinsic\nvalue, but the validate phase saved us\nfrom overpaying. Final verdict bid at\n13.8 a billion positioning KKR as a\npartner for growth rather than just anexit. Thank you."
