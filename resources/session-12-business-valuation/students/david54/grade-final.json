  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies DCF as an intrinsic valuation method and explicitly states and applies WACC as the discount rate with the standard PV formula, projects cash flows and terminal value, and reports a computed enterprise value. The implementation and validation discussion shows applied, not merely superficial, understanding, meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selected relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's) and cited market/trade multiples, then applied precedent EV/EBITDA multiples (12x–15x) to produce concrete valuation outcomes (10.8B–13.5B) and used those to validate the DCF and inform a bid. Coverage is specific, numeric, and integrated into the DRIVER workflow, meeting the threshold for a thorough introductory comparable methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student triangulated valuation by presenting a DCF and running comparable/precedent analysis, discussed the divergence (DCF vs. market multiples), and used validation (synergies/competitive bidding) to justify a conservative final bid. This shows a thorough, applied treatment of valuation triangulation and sensitivity consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct, conceptual approach—using EBITDA as a cash-flow starting point, projecting cash flows, discounting by WACC, and producing an enterprise value—showing partial grasp that valuation reflects value to all capital providers. However, they do not explicitly identify or adjust for core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, changes in working capital) or discuss taxes/NOPAT, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes a terminal value calculation using the multiple method and applies it in the DCF (Implement/Represent), satisfying the first sub-criterion. However, they do not explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value or discuss its dominance/risks, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly separates an explicit five-year forecast from a terminal value and justifies a higher short-term (8%) growth rate with operational drivers. However, they do not articulate a lower long-term growth assumption or explain the terminal assumption beyond choosing a 14x exit multiple, so the multi-stage growth reasoning is correct but incomplete.",
