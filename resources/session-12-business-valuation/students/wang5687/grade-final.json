  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly triangulated valuation across DCF, trading comps and precedent transactions, produced numerical low/med/high EVs and a football-field summary, and performed sensitivity checks (synergies, terminal growth) to test robustness. These elements show a thorough, applied treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly multiplies the base metric (base EBITDA = 900) by peer multiples to produce implied EVs (e.g., 11×900 = 9,900; 13×900 = 11,700; 12×900 = 10,800; 15×900 = 13,500) and presents low/mid/high ranges across trading comps and precedent transactions, and notes converting equity/EV—meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed values across multiple scenarios (trading low/mid, precedent low/high, DCF downside/base/upside and strategic with synergies) and provided numeric EV examples. They also explicitly identified how key drivers (higher WACC lowers EV; higher terminal growth raises EV; synergy capture increases EV) and validated ordering, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct, conceptual use of a DCF workflow (projecting future operating metrics and using DCF alongside comps/precedents) and awareness of terminal-value sensitivity, but it does not explicitly state DCF as the present value of future free cash flows nor mention using a discount rate/WACC to bring future values to present. That omission prevents a full PASS but demonstrates basic, correct understanding -> PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows partial understanding by modeling EBITDA→EBIT and applying a tax rate (implicit awareness of profit-to-cash adjustments), but they do not explicitly identify key FCF components such as depreciation, CapEx, or changes in working capital, nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers. This meets a basic correct treatment but lacks the comprehensive component-level discussion required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual awareness of terminal growth and exit multiples and plans a DCF, indicating partial grasp of terminal value methods. However, they do not present an explicit terminal value calculation (growth or multiple) nor explicitly acknowledge that terminal value typically comprises the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
