  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly projects free cash flows, computes terminal value using both exit-multiple and Gordon growth approaches, and identifies a WACC (9%) used in the valuation—demonstrating correct DCF mechanics and discount-rate application. The student applied these methods across scenarios and sensitivity analyses (Implement) and interpreted results in the deal recommendation (Reflect), meeting thorough introductory-level expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes terminal value using both Gordon growth and exit multiple methods with implied EV ranges and sensitivity analysis. Their sensitivity/heatmap discussion shows awareness that TV and exit assumptions drive a large share of enterprise value, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly distinguishes a five-year explicit forecast and separate terminal-value treatments (exit multiple and Gordon growth) and provides concrete short-term growth scenarios (base 8%, upside/downside cases) plus a lower terminal growth (2.5%) and WACC. That demonstrates a clear, reasonable multi-stage growth approach and sufficient depth for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly includes Free Cash Flow in their DCF workflow and implements it in projections and terminal-value assumptions, showing functional understanding (IMPLEMENT and REFLECT). However, they do not explicitly identify core FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) or state that FCF represents cash available to all providers of capital, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains multiple references to enterprise value and adjustments (e.g., adding synergies to EV) and a final bid range, but it does not show subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to arrive at Equity Value nor dividing by share count to compute Price Per Share. Given the absence of those explicit bridge steps, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external sanity checks by benchmarking against peers and precedent transactions and ran sensitivity scenarios discussing upside/downside and risks, but did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, CapIQ, specific market reports). That meets partial validation standards under the MODERATE rubric.",
