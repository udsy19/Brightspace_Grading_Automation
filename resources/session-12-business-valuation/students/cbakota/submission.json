  "transcript": "Hello, welcome back to uh session 12\n0:05\nassignment. Today we're going to be um\n0:08\ndelivering a full valuation of Panera\n0:10\nBread for a prospective KKR takeover\n0:12\nusing driver combining the DCF trading\n0:14\ncomps and precedent transactions to\n0:16\nproduce an informed bid range while\n0:18\nconstraining financial buyer discipline\n0:20\nwith strategic buyer synergies. Our deal\n0:22\nsnapshot is a scale of 6 billion revenue\n0:24\ngrowing at 8% with 900 million uh EBITDA\n0:28\nwith 15% margin, 400 million net income\n0:31\nacross 2,100 stores uh and digital sales\n0:34\nalready at 50%. Market references, we're\n0:36\nusing the industry PE um 22x uh with the\n0:39\npresident IB EITda multiple uh multiples\n0:44\nof 12 to 15X and then Chipotle trades at\n0:47\n35X, PE and McDonald's at 25x. Um\n0:51\ncapital assumptions of the industry has\n0:52\na WACCC of 9%. Management wants about\n0:55\n10% rollover. Strategic biders like\n0:57\nStarbucks and McDonald's are circling.\n0:59\nUh growth levers are 500 new stores in 5\n1:02\nyears. Digital mix to 70%. Dinner\n1:05\ncatering expansion early stage\n1:07\ninternational rollout and we'll have to\n1:09\ncreate an executive ready recommendation\n1:11\nthat states your valuation range,\n1:12\nwinning bid strategy and rationale for\n1:14\nchoosing financial versus strategic\n1:16\npositioning.\n1:18\nAll right. Uh so for our work we have\n1:21\nhere um we have a our code um this is\n1:25\nour projections for five years and has\n1:27\nall of our um you know snapshot we have\n1:29\nsix billion revenue 15 EBITDA um so\n1:32\nforth right here um we have FCF um the\n1:36\ncalculation for that our terminal value\n1:37\nTV um we have different methods so we\n1:40\nhave exit multiple Gordon growth\n1:42\ndiscounting um and much more um we have\n1:45\nour data frames right here uh this runs\n1:48\nour sensitivity report. Um, and then\n1:51\nthis is our execution of it for printing\n1:52\nout what we have. And this gives us our\n1:56\nsnapshot uh for 5 years. Um, see we have\n1:59\nour years, we have our revenues. Um,\n2:03\ngoes from 6,000 roughly to uh roughly\n2:06\n9,000 close to it. Um, and these are the\n2:08\nrest of our, you know, metrics that we\n2:10\nhave going forward.\n2:12\nUm, and based on all this and then also\n2:15\nhere's our sensitivity analysis. Um\n2:17\nwe'll go deeper into that and we'll show\n2:19\nsome illustrations of this as well. Um\n2:21\nwe can see our enterprise value um right\n2:24\nhere with the exit multiple and implied\n2:26\nEVLTM EVI TDA uh TDA. Um so going over\n2:32\nexecutive summary for a paner bread\n2:33\nvaluation bid strategy. Uh the\n2:35\nrecommendations for this would be about\n2:37\n14.2 billion to 14.8 billion. Um based\n2:41\non our driver um understandings right\n2:44\nhere\n2:46\num the bid opens up at 13.8 to clear the\n2:49\n15% um 15x precedent floor and then it\n2:53\nreserves capacity to stretch to 14.8\n2:55\nbillion. The angle is we're leveraging\n2:57\nthe 10% management rollover to lock in\n2:59\nleadership um pitch KKR as the\n3:01\nacceleration partner for the IPO exit.\n3:04\nUm and contrasted with the integration\n3:05\nswallow up risk of a sale to McDonald's\n3:07\nor Starbucks. the edge. We use the\n3:09\ndigital catering growth lever to justify\n3:11\na higher exit multiple of the 18x in the\n3:14\nLBL model, allowing you to pay more\n3:16\ntoday while sitting at a 20% um plus\n3:20\nirr.\n3:21\nUh and for our valuation triangle, we're\n3:23\ngoing to go over a few things with our\n3:24\nmethodology uh methodologies. Um so for\n3:27\ntrading comps, um we're going to use a\n3:29\nmetric of P& 22x to 30x multiples with\n3:33\nan implied ED range of 18 uh 8.8 to 12.\n3:37\nUm this is the industry average at 22x\n3:39\num versus the premium peers McDonald's\n3:40\nat 25x and Chipoli at 35x um is an\n3:44\noutlier ceiling. Um for president's\n3:46\ntransactions we're using a metric of\n3:47\nEBITDA at 12x to 15x with an implied EV\n3:52\nrange of 10.8 um billion to 13.5\n3:55\nbillion. Um JAB and Panera in 2017 and\n3:58\nrecent QSR deals uh likely undervalues\n4:02\ncurrent digital scale. And then for a\n4:04\nGCF, our Gordon growth, we're going to\n4:06\nuse the metric of WACCC\n4:08\num with a multiple rate of 9% um over\n4:12\n2.5% um implied DV range of 11.5 billion\n4:15\nor third uh to 13.2 billion. Um this\n4:18\nconservative assumes steady state cash\n4:20\num flow per uh perpetuity. Um then DCF\n4:23\nfor the exit multiple we're going to use\n4:25\nmetric EBITDA\n4:27\num with a multiple of 14x to 17x um with\n4:30\nimplied EV range 13.9 to 16.2. two. Um\n4:34\nthis is a primary benchmark. Captures\n4:35\nthe value of the 5-year growth plan and\n4:37\nIPO exit. We know our winning bid uh\n4:40\nrange is going to be 14.2 billion to\n4:42\nabout 14.8 billion. Um the floor is a\n4:45\n16.5. Um that's our walk away. Um\n4:49\nreturns compressed below 18% IR. And\n4:51\nthen our ceiling, the strategic knockout\n4:53\nstrategy like Starbucks could pay up to\n4:55\n17 billion due to supply chain\n4:57\nsynergies, but antitrust scrutiny may\n4:58\nsideline them.\n5:00\nNow we're going to talk about the\n5:01\nfinancial versus strategic buyer\n5:03\nanalysis. Um so for synergies with the\n5:06\nfinancial buyer um it's operational cost\n5:09\ncuts um digital efficiency and capex\n5:11\ndiscipline while strategic buyer um for\n5:13\nsynergies it's hard um supply chain\n5:15\nconsolidation sgna um elimination we\n5:19\nvalue um the financial buyer at 200\n5:21\nmillion added to EVV and then strategic\n5:23\nwe at around 1.5 billion um added to EVV\n5:26\num for strategic um constraints for\n5:29\nfinancial buyers of the IR threshold\n5:31\nmust achieve 20% IRR valuation cap is\n5:34\nstrict based on the exit assumptions. Um\n5:36\nand the strategic buyer EPS\n5:39\naccretion um can pay higher prices if uh\n5:42\ndeal is accreditive um less sensitive to\n5:46\nWAC um and then for management for\n5:49\nfinancial buyer it's aligned management\n5:50\nroles 10% equity stays autonomous\n5:53\nincentivized by second exit um while\n5:55\nstrategic buyer um management is\n5:57\nreplaced management often redundant\n5:59\nculture class highs a high risk um for\n6:01\nthe financial buyer advantages are the\n6:03\nspeed of execution no antitrust hurdles\n6:05\nIPO story appeals to ambitious founders.\n6:08\nWhile the strategic buyer, it's a lower\n6:10\ncost capital and massive distribution\n6:12\npower.\n6:14\nUh the winning narrative for KKK are um\n6:17\nStarbucks wants to own your customers.\n6:18\nKKR wants to fund your vision. We will\n6:21\nexecute this international role in\n6:22\ncatering expansion and take the public\n6:24\nat a 25 billion valuation with our\n6:27\nfinancial um buyer.\n6:29\nUh now we're going to go over the\n6:30\nscenario analysis and growth levers. Um\n6:32\nat the base case we have 8% revenue\n6:34\ngrowth and 15% margins maintaining 500\n6:37\nstores added. Um the result is a solid\n6:39\n2.2 MIC a multiple uninvested capital.\n6:43\nUm and then our upside case with tech\n6:44\nenabled um the digital mix hit 70%\n6:47\npushing margins to 18% lower label uh\n6:49\nwhich will result in lower labor costs.\n6:51\nUm the result of this also is a\n6:53\nvaluation unlocks 18 billion IPO exit\n6:56\nbecomes a tech offering. Um and then\n6:58\nanother one is the downside case um or a\n7:01\nrecession growth lows to 2% margins\n7:03\ncompressed to 12% on input inflation. Uh\n7:05\nthis results in DCF values drop to\n7:08\nroughly 10 billion and then downside\n7:09\nprojected is the real estate and steady\n7:11\ncash flow. Um so then on top of that we\n7:14\nalso made models for everything that we\n7:16\nshowed here and our valuations. Um this\n7:18\nis just all the plot and then putting it\n7:19\nin. It's basically everything we had up\n7:20\nthere but it's just visualizing it now.\n7:22\nUm so\n7:25\nfor this one right here in the top left\n7:28\num you can see in the top left it's our\n7:30\noperating um projections. Um this\n7:32\nillustrates the Jaws effect where the\n7:33\nEBITDA or the blue line right here um\n7:37\ngrows faster than the revenue which is\n7:38\nthe gray bars um due to margin expansion\n7:41\nfrom the digital mix shift. Um and then\n7:43\nwe're going to see on the top right over\n7:44\nhere is our valuation football field. Um\n7:46\nthat's what we named it. Um this shows\n7:48\nhow the recommendation bid of 14.5\n7:50\nbillion our red dash line um sits\n7:53\naggressively at the top of the precedent\n7:54\ntransaction um where is president right\n7:57\nhere um sits at the top of president\n7:58\ntransaction range but comfort when\n8:00\nwithin the DCF ratio uh scenarios\n8:05\num and then the base case as well right\n8:08\nhere um\n8:10\nuh this suggests we are paying a premium\n8:12\nfor control but buying below intrinsic\n8:14\nvalue. Um, now we're going to move down\n8:16\nto the bottom left right here, which is\n8:17\nour sensitivity anal analysis. Um, it's\n8:20\na heat map um of enterprise value in the\n8:23\nbillion dollars. Um, the dark blue\n8:26\nquadrant right over here. Um, is a high\n8:29\nexit multiple and a low WACC.\n8:33\nUm, while this uh shows value\n8:36\napproaching to 16 billion,\n8:39\num, which validates the IPO exit story.\n8:41\nUm and then our fourth one down here on\n8:43\nthe bottom right is our projected\n8:45\nreturns. Um confirms that the uh even in\n8:47\na base case uh right here at KKR\n8:51\nachieves a 2.6 uh MOIC a multiple down\n8:54\ninvested C capital I'm clearing the\n8:56\nstandard of 2.0 uh 2.0x to 2.5x hurdle\n9:01\nrate. Um the downside case remains\n9:03\nsolvent at 1.5x\n9:05\num protecting the firm's capital. Um so\n9:08\noverall I mean we learned a lot about\n9:09\nour sensitivity analysis, our projected\n9:11\nKKR returns, our MOIC. Um we evaluated\n9:15\non a football field playing field um\n9:17\nright here in this um graph right here.\n9:19\nWe also showed our operating projections\n9:21\nand our base case. Um and we went over\n9:23\nall our numbers here and our reasoning\n9:25\nbehind it and why we are choosing our\n9:27\n14.2 billion um to 14.8 8 billion\n9:32\naggressive buy um on Panera in\n9:35\ncomparison to um our competitors. We\n9:38\nlearned a lot today. Thank you so much\n9:39\nfor tuning in um and we'll see you um\n9:41\nfor our last um capstone after this.\n9:44\nThank you. Um have a great rest of your\n9:46day."
