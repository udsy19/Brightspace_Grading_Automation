  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly defines key inputs (WACC, terminal, DCF values, and multiples) and provides numeric ranges and cross-checks, plus discussion of factors that change results, demonstrating parameterization and scenario sensitivity conceptually. Given the MODERATE rubric accepts conceptual treatment and multiple concrete examples are provided, this meets PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission explicitly names the valuation object (Panera), frames the context as an acquisition by KKR with stated objectives/constraints, and references management as a stakeholder. These explicit statements satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover problem framing.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly selected DCF and multiples/precedent methods and listed concrete assumptions (5-year DCF, starting value, digital sales %, WACC implied elsewhere) and multiple ranges (12–15x). These explicit method choices and inputs satisfy the strict DRIVER requirement for clear methodology selection.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies a DCF (five-year model and value range) and names WACC as the discount constraint, and identifies free cash flow as a key driver—showing correct, conceptual use of DCF and discounting. However, they do not explicitly define DCF as the present value of future free cash flows nor show discounting mechanics or a thorough explanation, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly mentions free cash flow and applies DCF ranges (Implement/Discover), showing conceptual awareness. However, they do not identify FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT, depreciation, CapEx, working capital) nor state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers, so the treatment is correct but basic — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes a terminal value input (2.5% growth) and uses comps/multiples in valuation, showing they calculated TV. However, they do not acknowledge or discuss that the terminal value typically constitutes the majority of DCF value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
