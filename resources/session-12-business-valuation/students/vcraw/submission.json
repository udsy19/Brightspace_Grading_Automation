  "transcript": "All right. Hello, I'm Vincent Crawl.\nThis is my session um 13 or session 12\nassignment. Uh so today we're going to\nbe going over evaluation of Panera Bread\nfor potential takeover by KKR. Um we're\ngoing to be contrasting the financial\nsponsors discipline approach with the\npremium paid by strategic biders. Um\nwe're going to do it with the driver\nframework. So first we have the define\ndiscover stage. Um so that sets our key\ndata points. So our scale is $6 billion\nin revenue 9 900 million in um earnings\nbefore interest tax uh depreciation\namortization and that's 15% margin. And\nthen we have the weighted cost capital\nfor the industry is 9%. And then that's\nKKR's assumed cost capital. So that's\ntheir hurdle rate. And then the\nstrategic context, we have KKR, that's\nthe financial buyer versus the strategic\nbuyers like McDonald's or Starbucks. Um,\nand then the growth levers are a\nsignificant growth strategy including\n500 new stores and scaling digital sales\nfrom 50% to 70%. Um, so pretty much our\ngoal is to combine the discounted cash\nflows, trading comps, and precedent uh\ntransactions to determine KKR's in firm\nbid range and walkway price. So now\nwe're going to go on to the represent\nand implement stage. So we're going to\nrun our code.\nScroll down. Here's our code.\nAll right. So our represent stage\noutlines the core approach um a\ntriangulated valuation using discounted\ncash flows trading comparables\nuh precedent transactions um we're going\nto focus primarily on discounted cash\nflows as it captures value of Panera's\naggressive 5-year growth plan. So our\ndiscounted cash flow base case\ncalculations from years 1 to five uh\nthey assume a conservative decelerating\nrevenue growth profile to model the\nuncertainty of in executing the 500 new\nstore plan. Um and pretty much to find\nour revenues we're going to use that\ninitial revenue times\nuh 1 plus the growth rate. So that's\n6,000 million * 1 + 8%. So that gives us\n6,480\nmillion. Um and then we're going to use\nthat to calculate our earnings before\ninterest, um tax, depreciation,\namortization. So we're going to use that\nthat uh revenue times 15%\nwhich is the tax rate. So you do that 6\n480 million times 15% and that gives you\n972 million for the earnings before\ninterest, tax, appreciation,\namortization. And then we're going to\nfind our net operating profit after tax\nusing that EBIT DA uh time 1 + or time 1\nminus the tax rate. So that's that um\nEBITD DA which is 972 million\nuh times 1 minus that 40% tax rate\nassumption and then that equals 583.2\nmillion and then we'll use that uh NOAT\nnet operating profit after tax to find\nthe free cash flow. So that free cash\nflow formula is the NOAT minus uh our\ncapital expenditures.\nUh so we're using that uh NOAT 583\nmillion 83.2 million\num minus our revenue\nof 6 6,400 million times 5%.\num which is that uh capital expenditures\nassumption and that equals 448.8\nmillion. And then finally,\nwe're going to find that present value\nof the free cash flow. So, uh we're\ngoing to use that free cash flow that we\njust found at 448\n448.48\n48 million divided by 1 plus the\nweighted average cost of capital of 9%\nfor the industry to the one because\nwe're finding it per year. Um, and that\nequals 411.743\nmillion.\nUm, and then those are pretty much our\nintermediate projections for year one.\nthe free cash flows is 44\n40 448 million.\nUm and then the year five uh free cash\nflows is 445.5\nmillion. Um as the capital expenditure\nis high, the free cash flows remain\nuh relatively flat despite the high\nEBITD DA. And then the total present\nvalues of the free cash flows from years\n1 to 5 uh or the sum of the present\nvalues from free cash flows from years 1\nto5 is\n1,746\nmillion. Okay.\nNow we're going to go to that terminal\nvalue.\nAll right. So\nto calculate the terminal value uh or TV\nat the end of year five, we use the\nperpetuity growth method use assuming a\nlong-term growth rate uh which is G of\n3% and the weighted average cost of\ncapital is 9%. So that terminal value is\nequal to the free cash flows year five\ntimes that 1 plus the perpetuated growth\nmethod or uh the growth rate at 3%.\nUm\ndivided by the weighted average cost per\ncapital minus that growth rate again. So\nthat's\n4,400\n445.5\nmillion times 1.3%\nuh divided by 9 9% - 3% equals 458.8\nmillion / 6% which is equal to 7,648\nmillion which is that uh\nterminal value. And then we're going to\ngo go and find that discounted cash flow\nenterprise value. Um\nso we discount the terminal value back\nto today year uh zero which is the\ninitial year. Um so we're going to use\nthe present value of the terminal value.\nUm finding that we use the terminal\nvalue divided by 1 plus the weighted\naverage cost capital to the 5th because\nthere's five years. Uh so we put in the\nvalues that's 7,648\nmillion\num\ndivided by 1 + 9% to the 5th and that\ngives us 4,971\nmillion. So that's the enterprise value\nand that's the sum of the present value\nof the 5year free cash or yeah free cash\nflows and the present value of the\nterminal value.\nSo then\nWe go to the discounted cash flows base\ncase summary. So enterprise value is 6.7\nbillion. Uh the implied EBITD DA\nmultiple\nis 6 6,717\nmillion divided by 900 million which is\n7x. Uh\nand then we're going to validate this.\nSo we're going to do the DCF sensitivity\nanalysis.\nUm\nso\num the validate stage tests the\nrobustness of our 6.7 billion dollar\nbase case um\nenterprise value. Uh we perform a\nsensitivity analysis on the two most\nimpactful variables. the weighted\naverage cost capital and the terminal\ngrowth. Uh the table shows that our base\ncase of 6.7 billion sits at an\nintersection of 9%.\nAnd\n3% terminal growth, a slight reduction\nin the weighted average cost capital to\n8.5% and an increase in growth to 3.5%\npushes the enterprise value up to 7.9\nbillion. This suggests that KKR's\nmaximum defensible valuation or walkway\nprice ceiling is around 7.2 billion uh\nwhich is 3.5% growth and 9% weighted\naverage cost capital consistent with our\nDCF upside down or upside case. Um so\nthat's pretty much the validation or the\nsensitivity analysis and then we'll go\nto the evolve stage. So that requires us\nto model the potential premium for a\nstrategic buyer like McDonald's.\nUm they could afford it which KKR cannot\nignore in a competitive bidding process.\nSo first we assume the strategic buyer\nbenefits from lower weighted average\ncost capital 8% due to size and superior\ncredit rating synergies uh 3.5% of\nPanera's revenue from supply chain\nmarketing. uh store overlap leading to\nhigher free cash flows. So their synergy\nvalue is uh 6,000 million times 3.5\nthat gives them $210 million per year.\nFor the synergy value um the value of\nthese synergies is calculated as an\nannuity and discont discounted at\nstrategic buyers 8% weighted average\ncost capital with 3% terminal growth\nrate. So that value of synergies the\nsynergy at year five times 1 + the\ngrowth rate divided by weighted average\ncost capital for the uh strategic buyer\nminus the growth rate time 1 / 1 +\nweighted average cost capital of the\nstrategic buyer to the fifth power. And\nthis results in an added added synergy\nvalue of approximately $4.1 billion to\nthe discounted cash flow base case. So\nthat strategic buyers um\nenterprise value would be the discounted\ncash flows base of the enterprise value\nplus the value of synergies. So that's\n6.7 billion plus 4.1 billion which\nequals 10.8 billion. So the strategic\nbuyer resulting enterprise value is 10.8\nbillion and their implied earnings\nbefore interest tax depreciation\namortization multiple is 10.8 billion\ndivided by 900 million which is 12\ntimes. This 12 times multiple align\nperfectly with the lower end of our\npresident transaction range confirming a\nstrategic buyer can pay significant\npremium.\nAnd then that brings us to our reflect\nstage. So we use our valuation football\nfield.\nUm\nso basically we see the DCF of the\nfinancial buyer. Um and then we see all\nthe different\nbid ranges. So KKR's bid bid range must\nbe anchored between their DCF value 7.2\ntwo which is the max and the competitive\nmarket multiplies 9.8 * -5\ntimes um the recommended enterprise\nvalue bid ranges from 8.4 billion to\n10.6 billion and then the implied\nearnings before interest tax\ndepreciation amortization multiple range\nis 9.3 times\nto 11.8 times. uh we are taking a lower\nend of the market multiples giving some\ncredit to KKR's ability to drive\nmoderate operating improvements. Um and\nthen our executive recommendation for\nKKR emphasizes\nuh financial discipline. So we think the\nwinning bid strategy is the financial\nbuyer discipline. So that bid range for\nKKR they should initiate the bid at the\nlower end of the triangulated range at\n8.4. 4 billion or 9.3 times the EBITD DA\nand then that gives them the walkway\nprice ceiling. Uh that they must walk\naway if the bid exceeds the high end of\ntheir DCF upside case which was\napproximately 7.2 billion or eight times\nEBITD DA. The premium above 7.2 2\nbillion is only justified by synergies\nand weighted average cost capital\nadvantage that KKR does not possess. And\nthen a few negotiation talking points\nthat KKR must use um to justify a lower\nbid against strategic interests is the\n50% digital sales reduce the easy upside\ngrowth for financial buyer. the\nsignificant growth is already priced in\num\nthe capital expenditures. So emphasizing\nhigh capital expenditures 5% of revenue\nrequired for the 500 new store plan\nwhich presses near term free cash flows\nand limits the cash available for KKR to\nservice debt. And then uh using the 10%\nmanagement rollover as leverage, um they\ncould structure the rollover as a high\nvalue incentive contingent on hitting\nthe aggressive growth targets, aligning\nmanagement's interest with KKR's\nexecution plan without paying a high\ncontrol premium upfront. And in\nconclusion, KKR's winning strategy is to\nmaintain financial discipline and only\nbid up the value of their free cash\nflows they can capture. uh they cannot\nwin a bidding war against a strategic\nbuyer whose ability to pay is based on\nsynergies KKR cannot realize.\nThat's all I have for the session 12\nassignments. Thank you for this year andhave a good one."
