  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies DCF as the present value of future free cash flows and applies a WACC (9%) to discount annual FCFs and the terminal value, with worked examples and numeric results. The inclusion of a sensitivity analysis on WACC and terminal growth demonstrates thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated and discounted a terminal value using the perpetuity growth method and reported PVs for both the 5-year cash flows (1,746m) and the discounted terminal value (4,971m), showing TV dominates the DCF. They also performed sensitivity analysis on terminal growth and WACC, demonstrating understanding that terminal assumptions drive most of the valuation. This meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly separates a 5-year forecast and a terminal period, models decelerating short-term growth tied to a concrete expansion plan, and uses a lower long-term perpetuity growth (3%) with sensitivity testing. The mix of explicit-year modeling, terminal-rate choice, and sensitivity of outcomes shows a thorough, reasonable multi-stage growth approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes NOPAT and subtracts CapEx to get a free cash flow and uses DCF to value the firm, showing partial understanding. However they rely on EBITDA for NOPAT and omit explicit treatment of depreciation (or adding it back) and changes in working capital, and do not state that FCF is cash available to all capital providers explicitly—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes and discusses enterprise value extensively but never subtracts net debt (debt less cash) to derive equity value nor divides by share count to produce a price per share. Given absence of the EV→Equity bridge steps in Represent/Implement/Reflect stages, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invoked comparable methodology, named strategic peers, and applied EV/EBITDA multiples to Panera (showing implied multiples and using them to set bid ranges). However, the treatment is high-level—there is no detailed comps list or stepwise multiples derivation—so the work demonstrates correct understanding but is not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",
