  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames a DCF, details how unlevered free cash flows are derived (EBITDA → taxes → capex → NWC), and states discounting those future cash flows using a 9% WACC and a terminal valuation approach. The treatment is concrete and applied (projections, terminal multiple, sensitivity), meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly calculates terminal value using an exit multiple and also models the Gordon growth perpetuity, with sensitivity analysis. The student discusses the material impact on enterprise value and exit-risk implications, demonstrating a thorough conceptual and applied understanding of the terminal value concept.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates a 5-year explicit forecast from a terminal period and uses plausible short-term assumptions (5% revenue growth, 15% margin) with an industry-aligned terminal multiple (14x). They also test the perpetuity approach and sensitivities, demonstrating thorough, well-reasoned multi-stage growth treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames FCF as cash available to capital providers and explicitly includes taxes, CapEx, and working capital in the FCF build, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: the student starts from EBITDA and does not explicitly identify EBIT/NOPAT or the depreciation add-back component, so the explanation is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly calculates and uses Enterprise Value in the model and recommendations (IMPLEMENT/REFLECT), but there is no mention of subtracting net debt (or debt less cash) to derive Equity Value nor dividing by share count to get Price Per Share. Because the required EV→Equity bridge steps are missing, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses a WACC (9%) to discount unlevered free cash flows and parameterizes WAC in the model, and runs sensitivity analysis. However, they do not provide a defensible calculation or external benchmark justification for the 9% value (no industry average or build-up shown), so the treatment is correct but not fully substantiated.",
