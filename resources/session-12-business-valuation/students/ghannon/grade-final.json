  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly defines DCF as discounting future free cash flows to present value and uses a stated WACC (9%) to perform the discounting, with numeric terminal value and EV ranges reported. The plan, calculations, and validation steps across Represent/Implement/Validate show a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly includes a terminal value (6.11bn via perpetuity growth) and documents that TV comprises ~77.1% of value, satisfying both parts of the criterion. Implement and Validate stages provide clear, specific evidence of calculation and recognition of TV's dominance, meeting the requirements for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selects relevant peers (Chipotle, McDonald's), describes applying multiples (P/E and EV/EBITDA) and converts those to an EV range, and reports implied multiples and resulting EV ranges. Coverage is substantive and meets introductory comparable-methodology expectations, so it passes.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and uses core FCF drivers (EBIT/EBITDA, CapEx, working capital) and explicitly states FCF is cash available to all investors, but treatment is brief and somewhat imprecise (e.g., NOPAT/depreciation adjustments not clearly delineated). This shows correct but incomplete conceptual coverage, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes an explicit 5-year forecast from a perpetuity terminal period and cites short-term growth drivers (500 new stores, digital mix) and a WACC check, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide explicit terminal growth rate(s) or detailed numerical justification of a declining long-term growth assumption, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculates and reports enterprise value ranges and recommends an EV bid range (Implement and Reflect), but there is no evidence they subtracted net debt to derive Equity Value or divided by share count to get Price Per Share. Because the required EV→Equity→Price-per-share bridge is missing, the criterion is not met.",
