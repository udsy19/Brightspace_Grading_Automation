  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and computes free cash flows, applies a WACC (9%) to discount those FCFs, and calculates a Gordon-growth terminal value across scenarios. Implementation and reflection evidence show a thorough, applied understanding of introductory DCF methodology, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies FCF components (EBIT/NOPAT via EBIT*(1−tax), depreciation as D&A from EBITDA, CapEx, and change in NWC) and applies an unlevered free cash flow model discounted by WACC to derive enterprise value, demonstrating that the cash flows are treated as available to all capital providers. The implementation and reflection stages show correct application and interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates terminal value using the Gordon growth model (with a stated 2.5% growth) and quantifies that TV comprises ~76–78% of enterprise value, acknowledging its dominance and sensitivity. Implementation and Reflect stages provide executed calculations and interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly computed enterprise values and used them to set a bid, but there is no evidence they performed the EV→Equity bridge (subtracting net debt) or divided by share count to derive a price per share. Given the absence of those steps in the transcript despite executed modeling, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used WACC as the discount rate for enterprise free cash flows (explicitly discounted at 9%), demonstrating practical application (IMPLEMENT) and alignment with their DCF anchor (DISCOVER). However, they did not provide a defensible justification or calculation for the 9% WACC (no industry average, beta, capital structure, or input assumptions shown), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly summarized valuation results verbally with specific DCF scenario values and precedent ranges, demonstrating understanding and validation. However, the transcript does not explicitly show a presented table or simple chart; therefore the visual‑summary requirement is only partially met.",
