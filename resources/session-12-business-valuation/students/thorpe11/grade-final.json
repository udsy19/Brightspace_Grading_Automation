  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames DCF as a valuation using free cash flow projections and demonstrates implementation (code, DCF tables with discount factors and present values). They also reference a discount rate (WACC ~9–10%), and reflect on terminal-value treatment, showing a thorough introductory grasp of DCF methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both implemented a terminal value (via the DCF/code) and explicitly justified the method and parameter (conservative 3% growth), and quantified the TV's share (65–70%), demonstrating a thorough conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates an explicit forecast (multi-year DCF with year-by-year cash flows and growth drivers) from the terminal period and justifies a lower long‑term growth rate (3%) while using higher short‑term assumptions (e.g., 8% revenue, 500 new stores, digital mix growth). They also validate the terminal value's share of EV, demonstrating a balanced, well-reasoned multi-stage growth approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses free cash flow in a DCF, generates FCF schedules, and connects enterprise value to equity (showing awareness FCF drives value to capital providers). However, they do not explicitly identify key FCF components (depreciation, CapEx, working capital) and appear to derive FCF from an EBITDA margin plus tax without detailing adjustments, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and implements a valuation bridge and reports equity values, showing conceptual understanding and code-based implementation. However, the transcript does not explicitly show subtracting Net Debt (Debt less Cash) from EV or dividing Equity Value by share count to compute a per-share price, so the required steps are only partially evidenced.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references a WACC benchmark (9%/10%) and produces a DCF with discount factors applied to free cash flows, indicating use of a discount rate for enterprise cash flows. However, the submission lacks a clear, defended choice or calculation of the exact WACC used and detailed justification for selecting between the 9% industry and 10% management figures, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
