So, 0:13 we're going to go to collab. 0:22 In this assignment, we are going to 0:26 figure out 0:29 how to run a code 0:32 that's going to show us how to 0:35 um 0:37 calculate net profit like we did in 0:39 class. So, we go to Gemini over on the 0:44 right, available AI features, generate 0:47 code. 0:49 In the cell, I'm going to say, \"Hello, 0:54 would you generate a code to help me 0:59 calculate 1:01 net profit, please?\" 1:04 I'm nice, so I like to say hello and 1:06 please and thank you to my AI. 1:11 It's going to run. It's working. 1:16 Sure, 1:21 I can help you with that. I'll generate 1:23 some Python codes. 1:28 You can modify the revenue and expense 1:31 variables. 1:33 But right now, we have revenue as 1:35 10,000, expenses as six. 1:39 So, we're going to go ahead and hit 1:42 accept 1:44 and I will run it. 1:52 And there it is. That profit is 4,000. 1:57 And I want to take it one step further. 2:01 I want to know 2:04 a code. No, I'm going to say generate a 2:08 code to help me calculate 2:13 operating profit. 2:17 Thanks. 2:22 I want to see if I can take this one 2:23 step further. See what it does. 2:28 Define the operating consensus. 2:32 Okay, I'll generate code. give it 2:34 profit. 2:37 Okay, let's click accept. 2:44 So once we have net profit. 2:54 Um so we have net profit and then we 2:57 have operating profit I think which is 3:01 revenue minus operating expenses. 3:08 Oh well maybe I did that a little wrong. 3:11 But this is collab for you, professor. 3:16 If there's anything we need to modify, 3:19 just let me know and we can work on 3:22 this, of course, in class. I'm sure that 3:23 we're going to be using collab a lot. 3:26 Thank you.",

      "transcript_text": "So for session zero, our um our first assignment, we were first given the task of making sure collab would run correctly. And so we gave it prompts and our first prompt was calculating gross profit. Um, and as you can see here in the code, we first got to define what revenue is. And then we define the cost of goods sold. And then we just use this equation. Gross profit equals revenue minus cost of goods sold. And then it prints them out. Um, I copied the pro the prompt word by word um in class, but I somehow ended up with like set numbers and like it already solved it for me because I remember in in your prompt or your code, it was giving bigger numbers. Um, so I I don't know. Um, my revenue was only $1,000. Cost of goods sold was 600. And so my gross profit is 400. And so we then had to explain um what the code is telling us. What what are we looking at? So revenue is the total money earned from sales. Cost of goods sold is the direct cost attri attributable to producing the goods sold by a company. And gross profit is the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products. And then after we calculated the gross profit, we decided to calculate the net profit. And then we had a prompt g we gave it a prompt. And so it tells us net profit is gross profit minus operating expenses minus interest minus taxes. And so I had it right out coming for me. And so it adds on, mine added on to what we had previously. Um, and so it just gives us the operating expenses, interest, and taxes. Very low numbers. Um, and then so the net profit equation right here, gross profit minus operating expenses minus interest minus taxes, and then it prints them all out. Um, and then we can run it. Um, it gives us the same the same stuff. It'll give us this. So, um, what I really learned in session zero is, you know, it was kind of a refresher for from accounting. It has been over a year that I've taken it. Um, and so seeing seeing how AI can literally help us, you know, create something that we need to to be able to work and uh get ahead. Um, like and the the good thing about AI is sorry I'm just really sick right now. Um, the good thing about AI is, you know, it gives us code, but we also have to use human um, human wisdom like you were saying, and we have to make sure that what we're given makes sense and, you know, is able to run like this. Um, and if it doesn't, if it gives us an error, I don't know if I have an error. No. um it'll give us an error and then we can just go back ask AI you know what what went wrong what is what is incorrect in this code and then we can have it fixed. So session session zero opened my eyes to the ability to use AI in um our financial management class.",

      "transcript_text": "Hi there, my name is Alexandra Sumter, and I want to talk to you a little bit about what we did for Session Zero's class the other day with Gemini here. So starting off, we worked with a partner, and we were able to ask Gemini to assist us on this financial understanding of a company. they were able to give us a little bit of an in-depth but mostly we asked them to keep it in a k-i-s-s form which is keep it simple straightforward or i i call it keep it simple stupid but with this we asked them to get us the gross profit and the net income of this company and keep it in a coding form, pretty much, and I'm going to go ahead and explain that to you now. So, with the information that we had for our revenue, it was about $10,000, the goods sold was about $6,000, and to create the gross profit, you go ahead and subtract the goods from the revenue, which led us to about the gross profit of four grand total. Next, we're going to go ahead and go into the net income, which you were given the operating cost of about two grand. So the net income would be the gross profit minus the operating cost, leaving us to about two grand in total for the net income. And overall, Gemini was able to explain to us which each of these steps meant, along with any of the errors that came along with the coding. So we can correct that in real time. Obviously, you can see here after we created the coding, there was no actual errors when we did it in class. I don't believe there was any then as well, at least not the first time I did it. I don't know if my partner had any. I think she might have. We went back through and corrected some then, but at this moment in time, no. I can't remember exactly where we got this coding from. I tried to search back through the book. I just found this in my history, but that should be everything. Yeah, thank you for watching.",

      "transcript_text": "What I learned: In this week, we remembered a basic but important concept in finance called Gross Profit. I now understand that Gross Profit is the money a business has left over after paying for the direct costs of making and selling its products or services. The simple formula is: Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Revenue is all the money that comes in from sales. COGS are the direct costs of making the product (like materials and labor). How we used Colab and AI: We used Google Colab as our tool to write and run Python code. Colab is great because it lets us write code in \"cells\" and run them easily. We also used AI (Artificial Intelligence) to help us understand the concept of Gross Profit in a simple way and to draft the Python code needed to calculate it. The AI acted like a tutor, breaking down the steps and providing a clear example. This showed me how AI can be a helpful assistant for learning new things and writing code, especially when you're just starting out!",

My objective is to set up the environment in Google Collab, install the required libraries, pandas, numbies, matplotlib, and yfinance and verify that I successfully pooled data. So first I will start off by going to collab.research.google.com and signing up with Google Account I will create a new notebook and honestly this is fairly simple, just go right here. I will rename this to finance analytics setup and once we have that in the first cell I install the required libraries with the following command. So collab already has many packages but this just ensures that the right versions are installed. Next I test to make sure that everything is installed correctly by running the following... Okay, and when this prints successfully it shows that pandas, numbies, matplotlib, and yfinance are working and again finally I can check that I can access real market data using yfinance for example I can download like 5 days of spy data with the following code so if we go ahead and run this code right here. You can see that it displays the spy functions or data, etf, and now that we confirm that it works we can go ahead and call it a day. So basically in summary I was able to run code in collab, I imported all required libraries, I downloaded market data and that was pretty much it for session zero for the technical setup and environment configuration and thank you.",

      "transcript_text": "Hi, I'm going to be explaining this code that calculates gross profit. So, these first three lines of code here are the inputs. The first line is the sales price per unit and that is 100. And then the next line is the cost per unit which is 40. And then the next line is the number of units sold which is 500. And then this next section here calculates the total revenue. So it takes the sales price per unit, which is 100 up here, and multiplies it by the number of units sold, which is 500. And then this section here calculates the total cost of goods sold. And it does that by multiplying the cost per unit, which is 40, by the number of units sold, which is 500. And then this last section calculates gross profit by taking the revenue that it calculated in step one, and subtracting the cost of goods sold that it calculated in step two. And then these lines down here are what the code prints out then. So this line, it just prints the words financial summary and then this line prints the words total revenue followed by the revenue that was calculated in step one. And then this line prints the words total cost of goods sold followed by the cost of goods sold that was calculated in step two. And then the last line prints the words gross profit followed by the gross profit that was calculated in step three. So then if I run the code here, this is the output and you can see it got the total revenue by taking the sales price per unit which is 100 times the number of units sold which is 500. And so 100 * 500 is 50,000. And then it did the cost of goods sold. So it took the cost per unit which was 40 and multiplied it by the number of units sold which was 500. So 40 * 500 is 20,000. And then to find the gross profit, it did the revenue minus cost of goods sold. So 50,000 minus 20,000 equals 30,000. And that is how this code calculates gross profit. Thanks!",

So our professor is having us use Gemini, because this Google AI tool, and it's free. Most importantly, and AI is becoming a big part of how businesses industries work today. Also students also have been using it for critical thinking skills and most broadly, helping with homework assignments and project researching and stuff. So the goal for us, for me, isn't just to use it, but to learn how AI is responsible. So fact checking and getting results and applying critical thinking and just not copy and pasting answers, which is bad for this course alone, which was discussed yesterday in class, so Jim and I can can help us with research. It can also summarize articles and brainstorm ideas, breaking down complex topics into simple terms. For example, Python, what we've been using for our coding, finding net income, gross income, the statements we talked about yesterday too, that those are big things that it could break down for us, for our projects, and just financing a loan. So basically, by practicing with it now, we're gaining experiences with the tool, and not just us, but the companies are also adapting to their workplaces to help out with their projects, along with anything in construction fields. AI is also being a big part of that as well. So AI, Google, Gemini is not is somewhat similar to chat GBT. They're, I mean, they are both free. They're not always right, but they definitely lead you down the correct path, which helps a lot. Um, most importantly, they are both alone, very good tools to use for school. So um, they help us prepare. Um, if we can, if we don't have video at the top of our head, we use it to prepare for projects, ideas, assignments, even work. I use it in work all the time. If I don't have an exact answer and I can't go to anybody specifically in that time frame, then I can, I can pull up both, either chatgpt or Google Gemini. So it helps prepare for the for the future, and gives us an advantage when we can graduate and continue our careers. Because obviously it's, it's a newer thing now, so hopefully it just gets more advanced later on, and it helps us more out in the future. So basically that was just down my my simple, simple script just going over Google Gemini for this first assignment. And I hope it works. So thank you. Bye.",

So, I'm excited to learn how to implement AI and be the driver of AI. Um, hopefully to be more efficient and maybe ease up the process a little bit. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text": "for the gross profit calculator that we 0:02 had done in class. Um so I'm going to 0:04 walk through you know exactly how this 0:06 works and how this could be used for a 0:08 business. So gross profit is just your 0:10 revenue minus your uh cost of goods 0:12 sold. Um so in this you know with our 0:15 code first here we have you know first 0:17 of all to find the revenue. Um so for 0:21 example you know I used uh 15 or 150,000 0:25 you know for the revenue for this 0:26 example. Uh secondly, you know, we're 0:29 given our cost of goods sold, which is 0:30 really just direct cost of producing the 0:32 goods uh that a company does sell. Uh 0:36 then also include your cost, materials, 0:38 and direct labor. Um so for example, in 0:41 this problem, uh just for simplicity, I 0:43 decided to use 75,000 as a value. uh 0:46 when we move on to computing the actual 0:48 gross profit through the uh you know 0:50 before we move on to the formula uh you 0:53 before I actually apply the formula the 0:54 formula for the gross profit like I said 0:56 earlier is just going to be your revenue 0:58 minus your cost of goods sold um so when 1:01 we actually decide to run this code we 1:03 have uh the placeholder so we have you 1:06 know the revenue placeholder for the 1:08 variable so in this example you know it 1:11 holds revenue the variable holds a value 1:13 of 150,000 So, uh, when you print out 1:17 new results, you print, you know, the 1:19 revenue would be 150,000, you know, and 1:21 that number would take the placeholder 1:23 of this variable. Uh, moving on to your 1:25 cost of goods sold, the same concept 1:27 applies where this cost of goods sold, 1:30 uh, you know, variable has a value of 1:31 75,000 attached to it. So, because of 1:34 that, it gets it spits out the 75,000 1:36 when you put this in there to print it. 1:39 Uh uh finally you have the gross profit 1:41 which again similar to the other 1:44 previous two examples. Um the gross 1:47 profit variable holds the value of the 1:49 revenue variable 150,000 minus the value 1:53 of the cost of goods sold variable being 1:55 75,000. So when you when it runs through 1:58 this it would run through okay we got 2:00 revenue minus cost of goods sold. Put 2:02 that in here. Okay, then it comes out to 2:04 being 75,000 and that ends up being the 2:07 gross profit where the value ends up 2:08 being. It's at the end right here. So 2:10 when you run it, this is what it ends up 2:12 looking like and being displayed where 2:14 you have your revenue 150,000, cost of 2:16 goods sold 75,000 and again like I said, 2:19 gross profit being 75,000.",

      "transcript_text": "Hello. Today we are going to address the question, how do we find the gross profit of a lemonade stand? And we are going to approach this issue using the driver framework um which I'll touch on a little bit on the next slide. So here's a little layout of the driver framework which we'll be going through today to address our question. First we will divi define and discover. Then we'll replicate, represent, we'll implement, validate, evolve and then finally reflect. So the first part of our framework here we are going to define and discover. So we have defined our problem as um how do you find the gross profit of a lemonade stand? And so we have defined our problem um and we um will discover the solution for this problem. And as part of the defining we are also defining it as that we need to know our revenue and our cost of goods sold in order to find our revenue. So secondly after we have defined our problem we're going to replicate and represent. So for this we are going to reiterate that we need to find our input um our revenue and then also find our cost of goods solds sold and then finally compute gross profit. So now we kind of know the different pieces that we'll need to when we use our AI. Um we'll be using Gemini today. So we kind of have those things kind of laid out. Um and we know what we want to input into AI. Um so after we have replicated and represented, we will implement. So in order to do this, we will instruct AI what we want the financial the code of the financials to be in order to solve our problem of how to find the cost of goods sold of a lemonade stand. So I'll show that here on the next slides. I put this into AI. I clearly outlined um that the objective is to follow my instructions to code for gross profit of a lemonade stand and explained our plan um which we represented in step two of the driver framework which was to first find revenue then cost of goods sold and then finally compute the gross profit. I also inputed a few general rules there keep it simple. um our principle for coding is Python. And also just reiterating that we do not want to use functions or classes unless 100% necessary. So this is all part of our I or implementing stage of the driver driver framework. So this is the code that AI um gave us a simple Python script to help calculate the gross profit. Um so as you can see there they they followed our three steps that we established in the represent stage. Um so first they found the revenue of the lemonade stand. Um and we remembered that the revenue equals price per cup plus cups sold. So they then as number two found the cost of goods sold there which is the cost of lemons plus cost of sugar plus cost of cups. And then they computed the gross profit which is found by taking the revenue minus the cost of goods sold. And then they laid out all of the code there of how we would find um the revenue of a lemonade stand. Then finally there they gave us some more clarity of um each step of how to calculate that. So we would calculate revenue then cost of goods sold then compute gross profit as we touched on earlier. So this brings us up to um the next step of our Java framework which is validation. Um so in order to validate we can run this code several times. So we as we ran it in class a few weeks ago or last week I guess um we ran the same code and I got a similar code back and I validated it with my peers in class. So that is our validation and then we can evolve to a bigger problem. So the bigger problem that I saw with this is even though all I asked AI to do was to help us know how to calculate the revenue for a lemonade stand, it can actually help with calculating the revenue in anything. So it could be larger scale in corporations and companies or in small businesses or it could be something as little as a lemonade stand or um some other like small like a garage sale or like one day things like that or for bigger companies. So the bigger problem here is not just how do you calculate the revenue for a lemonade stand specifically but how do you calculate the revenue for any company any business any startup anything like that and we now know that no matter what the organization or company whether it's a lemonade stand or um Apple or Accenture or a bigger company like that um we know that we know how to solve for revenue and finally reflect um kind of similar to what I spoke on in the E or evolve or not. Yes, the E or evolve to a bigger problem step um in the driver framework. um kind of as I reflected on this question and this project um one of my big takeaways was that um it's all kind of goes back to the basics or the simple um things and simple formulas like in here we figured out how to calculate the revenue of a lemonade stand, but it could translate into up into bigger companies or into things like garage sales or startups or um Etsy sellers and things like that. Um, and this can help me if I ever um decide to sell anything. I have um created different like crocheted animals or stickers and other things like that and sold them to family and friends and I never I calculated my um cost of goods sold, but for some reason I never really thought to calculate the revenue itself. So, this could be really a helpful tool for me um to even input specific numbers into Gemini and and have AI help me calculate the revenue that I have made um because I haven't really done that before. I haven't done a great job tracking my supply costs and then my cost of goods sold. So, I think it could be really helpful for me personally to try to calculate my revenue for these small um crafts that I've sold to see how much money I'm making. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text": "Hey everyone. Today we're going to be taking a look at this uh simple Python script that shows us how to calculate gross profit based on revenue and cost of goods sold. It follows the KISS principle. So it's keeping everything simple for us. So step one, we define revenue, which in this case for the example purpose, we've gone with 500,000. And then step B, we move on to finding our cost of goods sold. So this is the direct cost of producing goods like materials and labor. For this example, we're going to be using 350,000. Right here we can see um ourselves defining and then printing uh the revenue as well as the cost of goods sold. And then we move on to step C where we're actually going to be computing gross profit. So what this function does is it takes the revenue and cost of goods sold and inputs and calculates the gross profit out of that. So the formula we're going to be using is gross profit is equal to revenue minus cost of goods sold. So we first have to define uh compute gross profit which is going to calculate the gross profit from the revenue and cost of goods sold which we're doing right here in step C. And uh then down here this is where we're actually going to call the function and run everything in order. And then finally we're going to print it all so that the user can see everything being printed. All right. That's it.",
