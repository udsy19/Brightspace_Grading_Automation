",FALSE,1,"(0:05) For a few weeks in January 2021, the entire financial world was captivated by a single (0:11) stock in GameStop. But beyond all the memes and news surrounding this, the GameStop event (0:20) provides us with a perfect natural experiment to stress test the core rules of finance. Today (0:26) we're going to dissect this event not with headlines but with data.
I'll do the driving (0:30) homework. So, firstly, define and discover our problem is very clearly defined. We are (0:36) conducting a quantitative test of the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis or EMH.
(0:42) The EMH states that all public information should be immediately reflected in a stock's price. (0:47) Our research design is a classic event study to see if this held true for GameStop. (0:52) To discover the context, let's look at the price and volume chart, which is right here.
Also, (0:58) from August 2020, GameStop is a very wide stock where our analysis identifies three key events. (1:06) First, in around August 2020, activist investor Ryan Cohen takes a major stake. (1:17) Second, in January 2021, the Reddit surge, the behavioral bias found as hurting, (1:23) becomes visible in the data.
And third, the squeeze peak, the price detaches from all (1:27) fundamentals. The volume profile is flagging. On several days, volume was more than three (1:33) standard deviations above its average.
This wasn't just high volume, it's a statistical (1:37) anomaly, a clear quantitative signal of a mass hurting phenomenon. (1:44) Next, represent. To test the semi-strong EMH, we can't just look at price, we need a model.
(1:49) We have to represent what GameStop's price should have been. Our framework for this is (1:54) Standard Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM. We can use the CAPM framework to calculate the (2:00) abnormal return.
This R-key metric is the stock's actual daily return minus its expected return, (2:05) given the S&P 500's footprint. This calculation isolates the GME-specific movement. (2:11) Any persistence from non-zero abnormal will find volatile emissions, (2:14) likely anomalies, and sign of inefficiency.
Then we implemented the event study. We (2:22) systematically executed this analysis using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas for (2:27) time-series analysis and Wi-Fi nets to source our data. (2:33) Here are two other graphs.
These charts just show our output of our implementation. (2:39) For months, the cumulative abnormal return is nearly flat. It's flat and zero, (2:49) just as EMH would predict, but then in January of 2021, it goes vertical.
This is the squeeze (2:58) represented in pure data, completely separated from market improvement. Our implementation (3:02) also quantified the behavioral components. We found fat-tailers, which a kurtosis of 19.9 (3:10) and a normal bell curve is only 3. This isn't just a fat-tailer, it's a statistical monster, (3:15) meaning impossible events were happening.
We also saw extreme volatility. During the peak, (3:19) annualized volatility hit 421%. This is a perfect quantitative example of limits to arbitrage.
(3:26) Even if you knew this stock was overvalued, the volatility would force any rational short-seller (3:31) to close their position, allowing the inefficiency to persist. (3:41) So now we have these explosive results. Next, I'll validate, which is crucial.
Are these (3:45) findings statistically real or just noise? Our analysis returned a resounding note that (3:49) the market was not efficient. Here's the validation. (3:57) So quickly before I continue, here's a lot of the outputs and some of the code.
(4:05) Here's libraries defining some of the data, importing data from Y-Finance, (4:11) the Yahoo Finance library, and then just doing some basic analysis of the different things. (4:17) I used M9 to help me out a little on debugging. It kind of guided me along the right way and (4:25) make sure all the formulas in relation to these variables made sense and then (4:30) jumped into visualizations, which I went over and then did a little statistical significance testing (4:38) and then just printed out all the results.
I'll put Sean here so we can see. Our test (4:45) statistic for this period was 2.01, which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that abnormal (4:52) return was 41.55%. Our t-statistic was 2.01, which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that (5:04) abnormal returns were zero. As a robustness check, we also looked at information appropriation, (5:09) which really efficient market, which showed immediate price discovery.
Instead, we saw (5:13) slow persistent wave mean abnormal returns of 21% before the peak, 41% during, and negative 17% (5:20) after. This slow-moving pattern is a classic example of a market anomaly, specifically a (5:24) momentum effect, and to clear a validation of our inefficiency finding. Once we've validated this (5:31) inefficiency, the problem evolves.
We apply this answer to a core financial question. What are the (5:36) implications for investment strategy? Could a rational investor have profited? The answer is a (5:41) yes. Looking back, a simple buy and hold for a period netted about 4,900%.
(5:47) Your analysis of when to enter is key. The early entry period, which was around August or December (5:54) 2020, saw 189% return. The late entry crowd saw 330, but with massive risk.
We even evolved this (6:02) into a simple active strategy, a momentum rule. For example, buy if up 5% yesterday, return to (6:08) 307% with a sharp ratio of 1.71. As you can see right there, this confirms that the momentum (6:21) anomaly was, for the time being, systematically exploitable. This highlights the ex-ante versus (6:29) ex-post problem.
We can't reverse this signal for obvious. In the moment, it would have been (6:32) exactly identical. Finally, we reflect.
This is our synthesis of EMH theory with behavioral (6:39) finance reality and the Balfour-Gamestop choice who won. Clearly, behavioral finance won in this (6:45) case. The GME event is a textbook case of how, in the short term, behavioral biases like herding (6:49) can overwhelm fundamentals and limits our arbitrage, like exchange volatility, (6:55) and can allow dislocation to persist.
What are the final implications for active versus passive (7:00) strategies? For most investors who are passive, this is a powerful lesson that reinforces the (7:07) passive diversified investing. For active managers, it shows that while markets are generally (7:13) efficient, they are not always efficient. For active strategies, this event shows that in rare (7:17) dislocated markets, sentiment is the new fundamental.
For policy makers, this event exposed (7:25) real cracks in the market structure, triggering a vital conversation about short interest trends (7:30) with circuit breakers and the responsibility of retail trading platforms. The GME wasn't just a (7:36) fundamental stress test of our financial theories, and the data shows us exactly (7:40) where the theories held up and where they broke down. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Noah and this is my work for session eight assignment, which focuses on market efficiency and behavioral finance.

And uh throughout this uh assignment which focuses on the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020-2021, we will do an investigation on its market efficiency. And as the first critical step of this assignment, we will first verify the statement that GameStop traded at uh 4 cents in August 2020 and if incorrect—which it is—we will document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication uh approach for correcting the professor, the person watching this video.

So I included, as kind of a context to the problem, we have the event timeline as you can see here. We have uh key data points and we have the most important part of it, which was the required analysis. And using deep research in uh Gemini, I made it in a way that uh the required analysis was actually sections of the actual uh document that we created, the actual market efficiency uh analysis.

So um I'll read that. I'll read two of those quickly and and we'll we'll continue on with the framework. So we have to verify all stated historical price data and document corrections. Test which form of market efficiency—weak, semi-weak, strong—was violated, evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. And we have to compare uh efficient market hypothesis predictions to observe uh behavior while also assessing behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies.

So utilizing the driver framework, we have to first define and discover, and for this assignment, it's the most important part. So the goal here is to have a clear understanding of market efficiency uh testing problems and research design. So the core problem here is that, as I mentioned before, we're using the GameStop event and uh we're using as a real-world case study to test a famous financial problem or financial theory called the efficient market hypothesis.

And to explain uh the EMH simply, it's the idea that stock prices already reflect all available information. So, if true, you can't really beat the market because there's no undervalue. Uh there's no undervalue in the stocks that you're going to buy or that you own, potentially, with the the very bold statement that the price is always, quote unquote, right.

And uh first, as I mentioned before, before we actually um start the actual analysis, we have to have a data verification. And uh we discovered that that was incorrect and that after adjusting for uh GameStop's 4-for-1 stock split in 2022, the historical price in August 2020 was in the $1.85 to $2.50 range. And the other core facts that we had available are all correct, as you can see here.

Now that we have actually defined, I think it's important to show you what uh Gemini has created, and I'll do that right now.

So let me just bring it over here. Perfect.

So uh with all the information, it started uh doing its research on multiple websites and then essentially uh developed this executive summary. And I could read over it, but what I really want to show—and I'll go over the most important parts—is uh here, the report objectives and structure. So we have, as I mentioned, section 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 that all relate to the original question on the required analysis uh section of the assignment.

But now I will actually go back to the Word document and uh we'll go on. So the analytical framework that we used, we used two lenses uh of competing financial theories. That was uh the EMH and behavioral finance, as you could could have seen in in the the beginning of the the document. And um we wanted to to test with one assuming investors are rational and prices reflect fundamental value, but also the idea that investors are human and not perfectly rational. So obviously there's going to be some psychological uh biases like greed, fear, and a tendency to follow the crowd, uh which is often uh mentioned or considered uh the fear of missing out, FOMO.

And consequently, that can create market bubbles. Uh a market bubble that may be occurring right now and um is in the media a lot is the AI bubble, and how that will uh turn out relates directly to behavioral finance. And I thought that was an ""aha moment"" for me uh while doing this assignment.

And uh to test the EMH, we must define its three forms. And the key question here is what information is reflected in the price. And then we have the three types that I mentioned before, which is weak form, semi-strong form, and uh strong form. And essentially, I think the most important ones to to mention is that weak form is all past price and volume data. Uh and uh strong form is all information, public and private. And semi-strong would then be all publicly available information, like news articles, SEC filings, and company fundamentals.

And then we want to to hypothesize that the GameStop event represents a major violation of the semi-strong form of the EMH.

Now we implemented. And essentially here, we used uh the method uh the capital asset pricing model, and uh which I explained in the other assignment, so I don't think I have to go into detail. But it really is uh determining a stock's expected behavior and how uh it correlates with the entire market. And uh we found uh the anomaly, and we also use tools such as uh uh yfinance found in Python to organize the data and uh run the regression model.

So here this can be seen... uh... going and and you can see all that I mentioned. So everything testing on on the weak form violation, the semi-strong form violation, and uh uh the strong form violation. I think we'll we'll we'll go on to that. But you can see that, as I mentioned, uh the document did include that, the executive summary did include that. And in this case, uh the semi-strong form violation was uh—as, if I'm... if I stand corrected—did a clear violation of of what happened in the GameStop uh event. But I was getting ahead of myself. I wanted to show the actual uh uh capital asset model um pricing model. And but here we have all the the math behind it and therefore later the conclusion, which is the GameStop saga was far more than a transient market anomaly. It was a watershed event that exposed deep truths about modern market structure and theory, leaving lasting implications for investors, academics, and regulators.

And this just relates to the idea that behavioral finance in this case took on a really big role, and I'll go into detail on that uh in the findings. So finding one: there's a clear violation of semi-strong uh EMH. Uh the event study show... which show massive statistically significant positive abnormal returns during the squeeze. This confirms the price surge was not driven by new positive fundamental news about the company. The price became completely unglued from its fundamental value, which analysts put at uh between $10 to $40. Therefore, the market failed to rationally incorporate public information, violating the semi-strong form, as I mentioned before.

Finding two was that... why wasn't this fixed? And uh the limits to arbitrage. So the question was that if the stock was so overpriced, why didn't rational investors just short it and push the price back down? Well, that can be... uh... uh and what is short selling, actually, before I go on that? So, shorting is betting a stock will fall. So, you borrow a share today for $100, wait for the price to drop to $40, buy it back, return the share you borrowed, and pocket the $60 profit.

And um... we're into how GameStop comes through this. This is a perfect example of noise trader risk, uh which is uh the risk that irrational traders uh can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

And then uh here we have uh in the ""evolve"" part, the application of efficiency insights to investment strategy. And overall, this just kind of relates, this last part that I I I talked about really relates to this active versus passive debate, where the GameStop event uh paradoxically supports both investment strategies. Which in the case for the passive would be um... to not use the market as a casino. And in terms of being a student studying this, uh the average person should avoid and stick to low-cost, diversified index funds. And uh the case for active investors is that the stock... the event proves the market is not always efficient. This creates huge opportunities for skilled active managers to find and exploit mispricings caused by noise traders.

And as an overall reflection to what... all the information that I kind of went on about, uh the market is usually efficient, but it is vulnerable to ""black swan"" events where human psychology, amplified by modern technology—an example of this is social media—overwhelms rational price discovery. So this whole saga is a lesson in adaptive markets. It shows that finance is not just a spreadsheet. It's a complex uh human system where psychology, technology, and market structures collide. And at the end of the day, you cannot predict the future with 100% certainty. If you were able to, you wouldn't... you probably wouldn't tell anybody. So, uh yeah, this was my project. This was my work on it.

Um, I think I'll just go on showing the sources, uh kind of an overview of what uh Gemini has used and what I have used consequently to to to present this. But you can see that many things were used and uh uh not necessarily copied and paste, as you can see here, but it was processed and... um oh yeah, no, this was actually... these sources were read but not used. Sorry, m- mild confusion.

Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Ronaksai. Uh, today I'm
going over my session eight assignment.
So, first,
uh, let me go through the first code
block um, and really explain what it
does. So, our first example tests the
semi- strong form of the efficient
market hypothesis, the EMH, which this
states that prices should immediately
incorporate all public information such
as earning announcements. So, here we're
going to simulate an event by
Calculating cumulative abnormal returns
C A R car. If the market is ei
plot should jump sharply on day zero and
then remain flat. However, our simulated
data um let me show you this.
Our simulated data here shows that
um shows a continued upward curve for
several days post the announcement known
as the post earnings announcement drift.
This drift represents a persistent
market in inefficiency where the market
process public information slowly
suggesting a violation of semi strong
EMH and potential create and potentially
creating a lowrisk momentum strategy
opportunity. So using um uh Gemini I was
able to create this code block and so
this code block actually shows us the
simulation that I just talked through
where we have our days relative to
announcement. And so normally it should
so show like a flat line if um
if it was um
if it was efficient. But since we don't
have the flat line, we have the the jump
um our chart here is inefficient.
Now moving on to my second example. So
this is going to be modeling the hurting
bias in simulated market. So this code
block shifts our focus to the behavioral
finance specifically
demonstrating the impact of the hurting
bias. Hurting occurs when investors
abandon independent analysis and simply
follow the crowd often amplified by
social media. We modeled this the
stock's price as a function of its
stable fundamental value and a non and
temporary non-fund fundamental behavior
component as you can see that on the
plot. So we have our observed market
price with hurting our fundamental value
and our hurting base period.
So we can we can see that on the plot as
uh the market price the red line
significantly deviates from the
intrinsic fundamental value. We can see
that right around this 45day period mark
where it there's an insane spike um and
during this behavioral period forming a
temporary bubble. So as we can see that
the spike really starts peaking right in
the middle of this hurting bias period
but it starts and ends at at that
period.
So it creates this temporary bottle.
This illustrates how predictable and
systematic psychological biases are
rather than rational information
processing can create substantial and
temporary market mispricings. So I
utilized AI in this case to help me
again create this code block. But AI
also in this case explain how the bubble
is created um with the hurting bias.
Okay. And then now lastly I'll move on
to my third example my final code block
which is assesses the risk versus
inefficiency of the value anomaly. So
our final example that I just started
with uh uses the simplest form of risk
adjusted analysis to determine if a docu
documented market anal an anomaly
such as the historical outperformance of
value stocks represents genuine
inefficiency or merely compensation for
extra risk. We apply the capital area
pricing model CAPM to calculate the
stock's alpha. The CAPM tells us the
expected return based on the stock
market's risk
on the stock's market risk. When we
subtract the expected return from actual
return, the remaining positive um the
remaining the remaining positive return
is alpha. A large positive alpha as
calculated here signifies an um so when
it says as calculated here we can see
that our alpha here is um 4.6% which is
relatively high. So this signifies that
uh an uncompensated return that is not
explained by market risk suggesting that
the value effect is indeed a p
persistent market inefficiency exploited
by skilled investors. So since the al
alpha is large and positive the value
stock excess return is not fully
explained by it market risk the beta in
this case um which is 1.05 5. This
suggests that the value effect is likely
a market anomaly as I just stated at
least by the CA capm test. So again
using AI I had it explain to me exactly
what anomaly risk is versus inefficiency
test and then it created this um code
block that kind of walked me through it.
Um so that's my session eight. Thank
you.

",FALSE,1,"Hello and welcome back to management
0:06
310. Today we're going to be tackling
0:07
session 8 assignment. Um today we are
0:11
challenged with um
0:14
we are given um the case of uh the
0:17
GameStop short squeeze. Um and we are
0:21
evaluating um the event timeline um key
0:25
data points and then required analysis
0:27
of this short squeeze. So to get right
0:30
into this um on this monitor I have um
0:34
all of our data that we're going to be
0:35
talking about my coding um along with um
0:39
just a little bit of information that I
0:41
use to help you know understand this uh
0:43
topic a little bit more.
0:46
So um we have um the first step that we
0:52
have to uh fully make is we have to
0:55
understand um we have to verify the
0:57
price of 0.04
1:00
um so in our assignments instruction
1:03
says the first critical step that we
1:05
need to know um is um whether it is 04
1:10
um for trading price. Um but as per the
1:12
insiders instruction um we had to verify
1:15
this historical data um points. Um the
1:18
provided timeline suggested a price of
1:20
0.04 in August 2020. However, an
1:23
analysis of split adjusted historical
1:25
data from NASDAQ and Yahoo Finance
1:27
indicates this figure is inaccurate. The
1:29
stock traded in a range of approximately
1:31
$1 to $1.70 during August of 2020. Um
1:35
this analysis will proceed using um the
1:37
verified historical data um more in
1:40
depth um later on. This uh correction is
1:43
crucial because it establishes the
1:45
baseline for the entire event. The rally
1:47
was from um roughly $1.70 to 483 not 4
1:52
cents. Um
1:55
so we got this uh majority of this uh
1:58
understanding from uh Wikipedia uh the
2:01
GameStop short squeeze. Um this is a
2:04
just a background of everything that
2:05
happened with this uh short squeeze
2:07
event. Um I've also watched the dumb
2:09
money um movie which uh goes into deep
2:13
um understanding of this um event. Uh
2:17
some things are a little bit you know
2:18
not to the tea. However um very uh
2:22
interesting movie and talks a lot about
2:24
this and it gives you a better
2:25
understanding of this whole um problem.
2:29
So moving forward uh we have to do an
2:31
in-depth analysis. Um
2:33
we have to verify other key points. So
2:35
the short interest at 140%. This is
2:37
correct. It is the single most important
2:39
uh catalyst. This public data reported
2:41
by firms like S3 partners showed that
2:44
more shares were shorted than existed in
2:46
the public float. This created a
2:47
mechanically perfect ticking time bomb
2:50
for a short squeeze. Um and the next up
2:52
is the price per uh price surge to uh
2:55
483.
2:57
This is correct. The uh intraday high
3:00
was 483 on January 28th, 2021. Um and
3:03
the Melvin Capital 53% loss. This is
3:05
also correct. The hedge fund lost 53% of
3:07
its value in January 2021 and required a
3:10
2.75 billion bailout from Citadel and
3:12
72. It ultimately shut down in 2022. And
3:15
the final point was the anal uh analyst
3:18
estimates of 10 to 40. This is a
3:20
reasonable range. Uh at the time, most
3:22
fundamental analysts saw GME or GameStop
3:25
as a failing brick-and-mortar business,
3:26
placing its value in this low range.
3:29
This highlights the disconnect from the
3:31
market price.
3:33
Now, we're moving forward and we're
3:35
going to be testing which form of market
3:36
efficiency was violated. In this case,
3:39
um the first one is the weak form. This
3:40
form was violated. Technical analysis uh
3:43
was useless. More importantly, the
3:44
momentum itself became a self-fulfilling
3:46
prophecy. retail traders successfully
3:48
used past data um to coordinate and
3:50
influence future prices, something EMH
3:53
claims is impossible. Um the next up for
3:56
the semi- strong form, this was
3:58
massively violated. The argument for
4:00
violation um was that the market price
4:02
wildly diverged from all public fund
4:04
fundamental data uh like the 10 to 40
4:07
value. Um the most crucial piece of
4:09
public information, the 140 shortages
4:12
was not correctly priced in. EMH would
4:14
predict that rational arbitrageers would
4:18
have already bought the stock to squeeze
4:19
the shorts, finding the equilibrium.
4:22
Um, however, in reality, the market
4:24
ignored the fundamentals and instead a
4:26
group of retail traders used the public
4:27
short interest data as a weapon to
4:29
create the squeeze. Um, the price did
4:31
not reflect public info and it was
4:32
driven by reaction to it. Um, and then
4:35
finally, the strong form was also
4:36
violated. So, all forms are violated. Um
4:39
if the semi- strong form falls then the
4:41
strong form automatically fails too. Um
4:44
the price was uh the price was wrong by
4:47
a rational me uh rational measure public
4:49
or private.
4:51
Uh finally we're going to evaluating
4:53
systematic profit for rational
4:55
investors. All right. For uh rational
4:57
fundamental investors, um a traditional
5:00
rational investor would have looked at
5:01
GME's balance price uh seen in the 1040
5:04
fundamental value and either stayed away
5:06
or short sold the stock at 100, 200 or
5:08
400 believing it was absurd. Um this
5:11
investor would have been bankrupt. Um
5:14
the new rational investor, a different
5:16
rational investor could have read the
5:17
public info, uh read the public
5:19
settlement, uh rationally concluded that
5:21
squeeze was mechanically inevitable. Um
5:24
and then this investor could this
5:25
investor could have systematically
5:27
profited by buying into the bubble not
5:29
based on the fundamentals but based on
5:30
rational analysis of market mechanics
5:32
and behavioral flaws. Um
5:36
rationality in this case meant
5:37
understanding the game being played not
5:39
the company val company's values of
5:42
GameStop.
5:44
Now moving on to the EMH predictions um
5:47
versus the observed behavior. Um an EMH
5:50
prediction observed uh the GME behavior
5:53
um the prices are correct and reflect
5:55
fundamental data but the price hit 483
5:57
while fundamentals were a 10 to 40 range
6:00
arbitrage is a is a stabilizing force
6:03
however um arbitrage be became a
6:06
destabilizing force in this being the
6:08
short squeeze um all public is instantly
6:11
priced in but the public 140% short
6:14
interest data was available but the
6:16
market didn't price it until a
6:17
coordinator group forced it do um and
6:20
then you can't beat the market. Um but
6:24
uh a large coordinated group of retail
6:26
traders demonst uh beat the specialized
6:29
head uh hedge funds in this um idea. Uh
6:33
next we're moving to the behavioral
6:34
finance explanations.
6:37
DMH fails here because it assumes
6:39
rational um actors on the market.
6:42
However, behavioral finance provides the
6:43
real answers to this. So um there's
6:46
different types of behavior. So the
6:47
first one is herd behavior. the entire
6:49
um Reddit of Wall Street Bets, which was
6:52
what fueled most of uh this GameStop
6:55
short squeeze um phenomenon. Uh
6:59
as more people bought in, it created
7:01
social proof and causing a cascade. Um
7:04
the confirmation bias they used were
7:06
diamond hands. Um and this narrative uh
7:09
was a powerful tool to prevent people
7:10
from selling, encourage them to ignore
7:12
all negative information um and only
7:15
focus on the goal of going to the moon.
7:16
and you know
7:19
squeezing the market. Um and then
7:21
overconfidence uh retail traders new to
7:23
the market believe they had more skill
7:25
and better information than the suits on
7:26
Wall Street. Um and then narrative
7:29
economics. This is the most important
7:30
one. The GME event or GameStop event uh
7:34
was not about a stock, it was about a
7:36
story. Uh it was a David and Goliath. um
7:39
uh people bought GameStop not to make
7:41
money but to make a statement and to
7:42
punish the hedge funds um that had
7:44
profited from the 2008 crash. Uh this
7:47
narrative gave the event a power that no
7:49
financial model could predict. Um so it
7:51
kind of take took it away from a model
7:52
prediction to more of you have to
7:54
understand the behavior.
7:57
The the analysis of these uh hurting
7:59
behavior and social media influence um
8:01
with uh the Reddit of Wall Street Bets,
8:03
it acted as a central coordination hub.
8:05
It was not decentralized um or wise
8:08
crowd. It was a highly motivated,
8:09
self-reinforcing herd. Um and they used
8:13
memes and slogans like apes together
8:15
strong and to the moon. Um they weren't
8:17
just jokes. They were powerful social
8:19
tools to enforce group cohesion and
8:21
discourage selling. Um social media
8:23
created a common knowledge game where
8:25
everyone knew that everyone else was
8:27
going um to hold. Um so now we're
8:31
evaluating the limits of arbitrage.
8:33
Fundamental risk. The rational trade was
8:35
short GME at 400, but the price could
8:38
stay irrational longer than the short
8:40
seller could remain solvent. Um, noise
8:43
trader risk. The noise traders uh were
8:45
not trading on fundamentals and were
8:47
actively working to punish arbitrageers.
8:49
Uh, their actions were unpredictable and
8:51
created massive risk in this market. Um,
8:53
the imple implementation cost as the
8:55
squeezes began, the cost to borrow G
8:57
shares to short them became uh
8:59
prohibitively expensive. Um and then the
9:02
Melvin Capital is a post child for
9:04
limited arbitrage. They were the
9:06
rational arbitrageer uh betting against
9:08
GameStop's fundamentals. They were
9:10
bankrupt by noise trader risk and the
9:12
inability to hold their rational um
9:14
position.
9:16
Um now we're assessing the market
9:18
microstructure issues. Um basically the
9:20
plumbing plumbing of the market broke.
9:22
Um trading restrictions. Robin Hood and
9:24
other uh brokers restrict the buying of
9:26
GameStop. Um this was the most
9:28
controversial uh controversial micro
9:31
structure failure. It directly
9:33
intervened in price discovery affecting
9:35
pulling the the buy support from the
9:37
market. Um and then the T plus2
9:39
settlement brokers like Robin Hood were
9:41
required to post massive amounts of
9:43
collateral to clearing house. Um due to
9:45
the extreme volume and volatility they
9:48
restricted buying not um not to help
9:51
hedge funds but because they couldn't
9:53
afford the collateral requirements. this
9:55
T plus two uh settlement system was
9:57
shown to be a major systematic risk as
9:59
well.
10:01
Um the aval systematic uh profit
10:04
opportunities existed. Um
10:07
yes, but the system was not a
10:09
traditional one. A rational investor
10:10
defined by EMH would have seen GM uh
10:12
GameStop as overvalued and shorted it or
10:15
stayed away. They would have lost money
10:17
or missed the gains. a new rational
10:19
investor, one who read Reddit, um
10:21
understood squeezed me mechanics and
10:22
analyzed public short interest data, um
10:25
did have a systematic profit uh
10:27
opportunity. This system was identify
10:29
stocks with um greater than 100% short
10:33
interest plus high social media
10:34
settlement um and you buy and hold. This
10:36
was a systematically rational response
10:38
to specific game um being played even if
10:40
it was irrationally detached from
10:42
fundamentals.
10:43
Um moving forward, the analysis of risk
10:45
adjusted returns. The returns were
10:47
massive, but the risk was equally
10:48
massive. The sharp ratio would have been
10:50
enormous for someone who bought in
10:51
December and sold at the peak. However,
10:53
the volatility was also infinite. The
10:55
stock could fall 50% in a single day.
10:58
This was not a risk-free arbitrage. It
10:59
was a high-risisk, highreward gamble. Um
11:04
um hedge funds were the losers in this.
11:07
Um they only had fundamental data,
11:09
private and expensive terminals, while
11:11
the retail traders were the winners
11:12
because they had public social media
11:13
data and public short interest data. Um,
11:16
and then the discussion of X amino
11:18
versus XPost analysis. Expost the
11:21
GameStop trade looks obvious. Of course,
11:23
140% short interest stock would squeeze.
11:25
I would have bought and held, but at the
11:28
time it was not obvious. It was an
11:29
extreme high-risisk gamble. No one knew
11:31
if the Reddit herd would hold, if it was
11:32
a whale could would sell or if a regular
11:34
would step in. A rational X anti
11:37
analysis would have seen a possibility
11:38
of a squeeze, but would have had extreme
11:41
difficulty in timing it and assume
11:42
assigning a probability to it.
11:45
Um now moving forward um we can talk
11:48
about active and passive management
11:50
implications. Uh this event had little
11:52
impact. GameStop was a small part of the
11:54
index. Passive investors just rode the
11:56
wave up and down. Um active uh this
11:58
event was a lesson in humility. It
12:00
showed that active managers who ignore
12:02
new de uh new data sources and new
12:04
market participants do so at their
12:06
peril. It has also highlighted the
12:07
extreme risk of shortselling. Um we can
12:10
see uh the market efficiency of policy
12:12
implications. There's more policy
12:14
implications. So the gamification of
12:16
trading are apps like Robin Hood using
12:18
turning investing into gambling. The
12:20
payment of order flow. This is how Robin
12:22
Hood makes money. Is it a conflict of
12:23
interest? And then the short sale
12:25
transparent. Should short um positions
12:27
be disclosed more quickly and clearly um
12:29
we don't know. And then the settlement
12:30
times, the call to move from T plus2 to
12:32
T plus 0 to reduce the systematic risk
12:35
that force Robin to halt buying. Um so
12:37
though that's kind of like our
12:38
understanding of the whole thing. Now
12:40
I've made code to kind of run over this.
12:42
Um we're going to be configuring the
12:44
ticker of GameStop um to um S&P 500
12:49
over here. Uh it fetches our data in
12:51
this subsection and then it prepares the
12:53
data in this section. Um we study the
12:56
event in the abnormal return calculation
12:58
right here. Um we get the market model.
13:01
Um for this um and then we perform the
13:04
OS regression as well. Um we use our
13:07
alpha as our intercept and our beta as
13:09
our slope. We move to step two. we
13:12
calculate abnormal returns of the event
13:13
window. Um
13:16
then we move forward to plotting this
13:18
result uh in numerous graphs alongside
13:21
everything else. Um cumulative abnormal
13:24
returns, volume analysis, normalized
13:26
price analysis
13:29
and then we define the full range uh of
13:31
data. Um and this is where we are right
13:33
here. So um through our calculator and
13:36
you know all the other information that
13:38
we've just learned and we've uh curated
13:40
into this to understand um the basic uh
13:42
fundamental of this GameStop case we can
13:45
now move to this. So this is um fetching
13:48
the data from GameStop and S&P 500 from
13:50
2019 to 2021. It's been completed
13:54
completed. The market model here is the
13:55
estimation period of 2019 um as a year
13:59
and the alpha is negative.4516
14:02
and the beta is 1.48. 4830 and the R
14:05
squar is 0575.
14:08
But however um in the event window
14:10
analysis of 2020 to 2021 we see the mean
14:14
daily abnormal return is at a 025314
14:18
or a 2.534
14:20
uh14%.
14:22
Um the t statistic is 1.6 while the p
14:24
value is 0.1. um and the p value um
14:28
being greater um than zero uh 0.05 we
14:32
fail or reject the null hypothesis. Thus
14:34
the conclusion the abnormal returns are
14:36
not significantly uh uh statistically
14:39
significant in this um
14:43
uh this case.
14:46
So, now we're going to move forward to
14:48
um the normalized stock price in this um
14:51
we can see it compares GameStop and S&P
14:54
500 and you see that huge spike right
14:55
there um at 2021 with the normalized
14:58
stock price. It shoots up right there.
15:00
Now, we're going to move forward to the
15:01
uh GameStop trading volume um trading
15:04
volume. So with this understanding um
15:06
trading volume uh is the understanding
15:08
uh of the total number of shares or
15:10
contracts that are traded between buyers
15:12
and sellers during a spec specific
15:13
period of time typically in a single
15:15
day. Um why is this important now? Well,
15:19
volume is a critical piece of data
15:20
because it helps analysts and traders
15:22
gouge the strength or conviction between
15:24
a stock's price movement. Price alone
15:26
only tells you what happened while
15:28
volume tells you how much participation
15:30
was behind that move. So if the price
15:32
moves up and the volume moves up in this
15:34
case price and volume both moved up this
15:37
is a strong bullish sign. It shows that
15:38
many buyers are enthusiastically
15:40
participating um which confirms the
15:43
upward trend. If price goes down and
15:46
volume goes up this is a strong bearish
15:48
sign. It shows heavy selling pressure
15:49
and high participation in downward
15:51
moving um and confirming the bearish
15:53
trend. If the price goes up and volume
15:55
goes down, this is a weak bearish
15:57
warning sign. This price is rising but
15:58
fewer people are participating. lack of
16:00
interest. Price goes down and volume
16:02
goes down. This is a weak bullish sign.
16:04
The price is falling but selling
16:06
pressure is drying up. Um but in this
16:08
case we have the first one price is um
16:10
going up and volume is going up which
16:12
mean is a strong bearish sign. People
16:14
are not only participating in this but
16:16
they're the price is also going up with
16:18
this participation. So we can see that
16:20
GameStop at this point in time had a
16:22
very strong bullish sign. Now moving on
16:25
to our cumulative abnormal um returns.
16:28
We see that in this time our cumulative
16:30
abnormal returns were skyrocketing at
16:32
this time. Um this is not what we are
16:35
expecting from this stock. You can see
16:37
over here in uh earlier 2020 we weren't
16:39
expecting much but 2021 it absolutely
16:42
skyrockets and that kind of just goes to
16:44
show with the volume is that the
16:45
abnormal returns and um the volume had
16:48
something to um were highly correlated
16:51
um in this um market.
16:54
So understanding all this we now know
16:57
that we have not only um
17:05
understood the market efficiency
17:06
testing. Um we've also just understood
17:09
the behavioral finance analysis. Um in
17:12
that beginning part um we've understood
17:14
the uh rational investor probability
17:16
analysis um that we couldn't really
17:19
predict it at the time. Um and we've
17:21
also understood the theoretical
17:22
implications of um you know our model of
17:26
EMH versus our behavioral finance and
17:29
and we made this code to help us
17:31
understand the abnormal calculations of
17:34
returns of abnormal returns. Um through
17:36
this whole thing we've learned a lot
17:38
about GameStop and we've learned about
17:39
the short squeeze and how sometimes we
17:42
can't really predict things in the stock
17:44
market. Um especially when we don't have
17:46
full understanding of our um information
17:48
and data.
17:50
Um and it all started with uh
17:52
understanding our first critical step of
17:54
verifying the price where we started. Um
17:56
and then also understanding uh our
17:58
ranges um or an our analyst estimates.
18:02
Um going through all this we now
18:04
understand a lot more about trading. We
18:06
know a lot more about the short squeeze.
18:08
We know about herd behavior and how
18:11
behavioral sometimes can uh is a better
18:13
understanding than using certain models
18:16
to predict. Um, only having one view
18:19
doesn't help us. We have to actually
18:20
understand the full story. Um,
18:22
especially when we're looking at
18:24
different charts on volume, um, abnormal
18:26
returns and, um, normalized stock
18:28
prices. Um, we've learned a lot. Thank
18:31
you so much for tuning in. Um, and
18:32
that'll be it for Management 310 session

Certainly! Here is the transcript of the video:

0:00:13 Hello everyone. My name is Krish, and I'll be explaining the analysis on GameStop stock performance in August 2020 and how it connects to the efficiency market hypothesis or EMH. I'll be using the driver framework to organize my explanation that stands for definition, um, 0:00:50 relationships, interpretation, validation, evaluation, and reflection. So, let's start with the definition first. So, the efficiency market hypothesis basically suggests the asset prices are fully reflect all available information it has. Um, 0:01:21 And the three forms are weak form efficiency, semi-strong efficiency, and strong form efficiency. Prices reflect all uh historical prices, meaning you can't consistently earn profits using past trends or charts, which is weak form efficiency. 0:01:46 And um the opposite of that is where prices reflect all information, both public and private, even insider info that is strong form efficiency. My analysis focuses on GameStop's stock during August 2020 by studying how its prices behaved and how information was incorporated in into that price. 0:02:18 We can classify how the market responded relative to these EMH forms. Then uh moving on to the R part, I focused on the key relationship between information and price movement. In an efficient market, 0:02:44 new information should be reflected in stock prices immediately and accurately. If GameStop GameStop's price responded quickly to changes in public information like earnings reports or trading volume, that supports the semi-strong form of EMH. 0:03:19 Uh, but if prices showed delayed reactions of predictable trends, that would uh suggest some inefficiency. By observing the price patterns of uh August 2020, we can analyze whether the market anticipated future changes or overreacted, both of which gives insights into how efficiently the market processed the information. 0:03:52 For the interpretation part, I took GameStop's prices in August 2020, didn't show any evidence of extreme undervaluation like the rumored $0.04 per share. Prices were consistently well above that. This means the market was functioning efficiently. Um, and in other words, the claim that GME traded at an unrealistic low price was inconsistent with actual market data. 0:04:32 To validate this, um, 0:04:40 uh, I even measured the abnormal returns, the difference between stock's actual return and the return expected based on market movements. If abnormal returns occur only around the event date and disappear quickly, the market is considered efficient, but if abnormal returns persist or are predictable, that would challenge the EMH. 0:05:14 For GameStop, price adjustments seem consistent with normal market reactions, meaning there was no clear pattern of abnormal or predictable returns during that period. Uh, to evaluate, uh, I saw if the markets are efficient, especially in the semi-strong sense, 0:05:54 it's extremely difficult for investors to beat the market consistently using public information. This is why passive investing like holding index funds often out performs active trading after cost and risks are considered. However, in practice, markets aren't perfectly efficient. 0:06:29 There are behavioral biases like overconfidence, anchoring, herding, or and loss aversion that can cause prices to deviate temporarily from fair value. In cases like GameStop's later short squeeze, these behavioral factors clearly overpowered rational pricing for a while, showing that even in an over efficient market, 0:07:11 psychology can create temporary inefficiencies. 0:07:14 To reflect, uh, finally to reflect on the analysis, uh, testing the market efficiency, uh, wasn't just about looking at prices, it's also about understanding how information, behavior, and risk all interact in real-time. We also need to consider a limit to arbitrage. 0:07:49 This is where situations where traders can't easily can't easily consider mispricing, correct mispricings because risk, regulation, or costs 0:08:08 and asset substitutions are a problem, where leveraged firms might take on excessive risks for the complicating pricing accuracy. 0:08:24 The key takeaway is that while financial markets are broadly efficient, they're not perfectly efficient. Information is generally incorporated quickly, but investor psychology and structural limits mean that temporary mispricing can and do occur. 0:08:58 So in our analysis of GameStop, prices behaved efficiently in during August 2020, consistent with EMH, but later surge in 2021 reminds us that human behavior can always change theoretically and efficiency theoretical efficiency. 0:09:37 To sum up, the driver framework helps break down the break down complex topics like EMH into clear steps, defining the concept, identifying relationships, interpreting results, validating methods, evaluating implications, and reflecting on the broader meaning. 0:10:04 By applying the framework, uh I moved just uh moved beyond just uh data and numbers, but also to really understand how markets process information and why efficiency uh matters. Uh I you can see over here I have used uh Python uh in Colab to make my analysis much more simple and easier to understand. 0:10:55 Uh so, I have seen uh taken the top five highest positive daily returns and the top lowest negative daily returns uh to make this chart which explains the uh which explains GameStop's daily returns from 2020 to 2023. 0:11:37 Um, then uh I have also used various formulas and gone through many loops to come to that conclusion. 0:11:58 Um, over here you can see I have used the GameStop's closing price from 2020 to 2023 and you can see how there was a huge rise in 2021, but then it slowly started dipping. Uh so, the reason our reasoning has also been provided in the code. So, it shows 0:12:47 how the GME closing prices were plotted successfully and represent the stock's behavior showing significant price movement. The next step is to analyze the visual trends and prepare for in-depth analysis assessment against the market efficiency hypothesis and behavioral finance explanations 0:13:30 which includes identifying key periods of interest from the graph. So, which the previous graph I showed you was about that. 0:13:46 And moving forward, these are all the formulas which I used and the summary of the GME's historical data when it was going on a low, when it was at a high, when it opened, and the total volume has also been shown. 0:14:31 Then the total statistics of the GME in August 2020. 0:14:52 Overall, the analysis really helped me understand how GME stocks were going up and down and the whole statistics and gave me a fair idea of how the market works and how investors should invest. 0:15:33 Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"session 8, our objective is to
rigorously test the efficient market
hypothesis, the EMA using the GameStop
short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 as a
distinctive case study. This analysis is
guided entirely by our driver framework
ensuring a structured datadriven
investigation.
We begin with the most critical step of
back verification. The assigned uh
stated GM uh traded at 0.04 in August
2020,
which is incorrect. Our data confirms
the actual closing price in August 2020
was approximately 6.68 or 1.67
adjusted for the subsequent stock split.
We must use the split adjusted price of
1.67 for academic rigor in our time
series analysis.
Uh this sets the foundation for
professional correction. The research
problem. The GME event uh presents an
unparallel challenge to EMH. Here was a
declining retailer at its stock price
surge from 17 to over 500 per share.
Pre-squeeze analyst estimates uh valued
the company between $10 to $40. Uh we
must uh determine if this
price divergence constitutes a systemic
systematic failure of market efficiency.
We will test the three forms of EMH
weak, semi- strong and strong. To
isolate the abnormal performance caused
by the squeeze, we are going to deploy
the event study method meth methodology.
the gold standard in empirical finance.
Our benchmark for normal return is the
market model. A practical application of
uh CPM that which we did in the previous
session. We use daily returns against
S&P 500 index over a robust 250day
estimation window prior the event. We
define the event initiation as T0 as
January 13, 2021, the first day that GME
experienced a
uh
significant
um unexplained surge following the news
events.
Uh we segment the analysis into three
cry windows. Uh pre-squeeze momentum,
the squeeze peak and the restrictions
aftermath. The core test revolves around
the cumulative abnormal return or car
during the squeak uh squeeze peak.
Following the represent stage, we move
on to the implementation using Python in
Google Collab. First, we ingest the
historical GME and SNP data. Calculate
return and segment the estimation
window. We run the O. We run the OS uh
regression to estimate the market model
parameters to the resulting alpha and
beta. Uh define the stock's normal risk
relationship with the market prior to
the anomaly. These parameters are then
used to calculate the abnormal returns.
The difference between the actual return
and our expected return across the
entire period uh event period. Uh the
validation stage confirms our hypothesis
regarding market inefficiency semi-
strong EMH test public information by
aggregating theor abnormal returns. We
calculate the cumulative abnormal return
or the car the car for peak quiz uh
period was astronomically positive and
decisively statistically significant. T
statistic uh well about the critical
values this confirms a severe violation
of the semi- strong EMH. Why is this?
Because the market fails to
instantaneously and rationally price the
publicly available information.
Uh
I apologize for the pause. I was
extremely sick. Uh well getting back to
our analysis.
uh we were doing the semi- strong em
test uh so by aggregating the abnormal
returns we calculate uh the cumulative
abnormal return uh so forth like once we
have a confirmation of a severe
violation of semi- strong EMH
uh we can know that the market failed to
instantaneously and rationally price the
publicly available information the
fundamental decay of the company and the
structural risk of 140 30% short
interest. The price was driven by
friction and not the fundamentals. Uh
weak form EMH test uh based on the
historical price data. Um
the test the returns during the volatile
period were not randomly distributed
indicating the presence of a short-term
predictability and momentum patterns.
Furthermore, econometric analysis
confirmed an anti-leverage effect uh
which is basically volatality increased
when GME prices went up and a highly
regular irregular phenomenon confirming
speculative trend following uh flows. Uh
coming to the behavioral validations and
limits to the arbitrage. The failure of
arbitrage to correct this mispricing is
the key. The anomaly persisted because
of the limits to arbitrage. As GME's
price soared, short sellers like Melvin
Capital, which lost 53% faced
unsustainable sorting of margin calls.
This forced liquidation or the asset
substitution problem mechanically pushed
the price higher, preventing rational
investors from closing the gap. The
event was fueled by hurting mentality
and conformity bias on social media uh
where investors mimicked group behaviors
disregarding their own analysis and
creating a self-fulfilling price bubble.
Uh while massive profits were generated
uh exposed after the fact, the extreme
nonlinear and unpredictable nature of
the behavioral coordination meant that
no rational investor would have
systematically exploited this mispricing
uh before the fact with a predictable
risk adjusted strategy. Coming to the
evolved part of our driver methodology
which is a theoretical shift in
strategy. Um the GME event requires an
evolution in our theoretical
understanding. It supports the
adaptations markets hypothesis the AMH
uh which is efficiency is not constant
but temporary. The market's ecology
shifted when coordinated. Retail traders
enabled by technology, amplified
behavioral biases, creating fleeting but
extreme arbitrage opportunities that
institutional funds can close due to
leverage constraints.
Uh what are the strategic implications
here? Activ active managers must now
integrate social coordination risk into
their shortselling models. the old
assumption that liquidity and capital
are sufficient to close um
uh any mispricing before margin calls by
it is fundamentally flawed. This also
reaffirms the difficulty of actor
management for majority of investors
underscoring the shift towards passive
index space strategies. Uh reflecting on
of on this policy implications and
conclusions
uh the event exposed significant flaws
in market infrastructure particularly
clearing so and settlement process. The
SE SEC subsequent report identified
critical areas to review specifically
the impact of digital engagement
practices or the gamification of
investing and the transparency issues
surrounding the payment of order flow
PFO.
In conclusion, the GME short squeeze
conclusively
demonstrated that the weak and semi-
strong forms of efficient market
hypothesis failed under structural and
behavioral stress. It was not a failure
of information availability but a
failure of information incorporation due
to collective irrationality and a severe
limit to the arbitrage. Uh this event
underscores the need for robust risk
models and regulatory modernization to
safeguard market stability in the age of
social media driven finance.
And that would be it. And this is what
we got from our code here.
Uh so yeah that is all for session 8.

",FALSE,1,"Alright, welcome to my Session 8 assignment. I'm Spencer Beebe. Umm, So yeah, this week we're looking at market efficiency investigation. Uh, assignment overview. We're looking at GameStop and the short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. Umm. We'll look at the historical data and how it's relative to the efficient market hypothesis predictions, and then we'll evaluate whether the market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or not. Uh, so the first step, verify the statement, GameStop traded at $0.04 in August of 2020. So, uh, I just use Yahoo Finance uh, went over to GameStop corporation GME, Uh, and then I just went back in the historical data here, uh, and as you can see. Uh, of January 2021, it's opened at $4.75. Uh reached a low of 427 and a high of 1/20/75 and it closed at 8125. Umm, so much higher than the four cents that was. Um stated earlier in the instructions, so actually. Uh, in August of 2020. So that would be. Right here. It closed at $1.67. Uh, it opened at $1.01. So much higher than the four cents that was predicted, so I put here in the find and discover right here. GameStop traded at .4 in August 2020, which is false. It was actually $1.67 umm Ryan Cohen stake umm, so it was predicted he had what 13% ownership uh. I found 12.9, so basically 13% uh now is through his RC ventures uh. So that's correct. That timeline fills in uh and then January 20. One, like I said earlier, the peak was 1/20/75. Uh, low 4/20. Or 427 and then it closed at 8125. So that's the, uh, correct data. Umm, so that's what I used going forward. Umm, So I just made a little timeline here. So August 3rd, that's pre Cohen involvement. That was 411. Once he acquired 13%, it jumped up to 656. Umm. January 4th is when it started. That squeeze jumped up to 17 uh, that Reddit attention, the subreddit uh, made it jump to 31. Retail trading spikes to $65 and then uh. Peak closing price was 97, but it jumped up to uh. That was the closing price. The high was 1/20/75 and it closed at UMM. I need to change this close at 8125. Uh, and then. You le going further uh along the line in February, it dropped down again to 60 uh and as you can see here as of uh let's see what's the date November 12th of 2025, it's trading at $21.00 uh and it's kind of evened out it's kind of plateaued since that spike in 2020. Umm definitely still higher than what it was pre 2020 uh, which is good for the company uh revived GameStop uh and you know. Allowed them to to not go out of business. So the goal here is to test the EMH weak, semi strong strong and explain its behavior is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. Umm so a weak EMH reflects all information and past prices. Umm so an interpretation of that significant auto correlation or predictable patterns and returns around the event implies a violation of. Weak form emh umm but temporary auto creation due to microstructures, frictions and information arrival can appear ex post uh. So a a violation of a weak form umm basically means that there's predictable patterns in the returns uh, for that event. So for a semi strong EMH. Umm, if abnormal returns persist after public news is released? Umm. So that means that's a violation of the, uh, semi strong EMH? And then the strong image, it's very hard to test. You got to look for evidence of insider trading or abnormal profits, uh, with, you know, traders with private access. So it's not usually supported. Uh, it's very hard to, uh, uncover unless there's, you know, SEC filing, umm, or you know, investigation into, into the company or the traders. Alright, so that is the define discover there. Uh, we've created a timeline of everything. We found the correct historical data, Uh, and then we kind of just gave a little overview of what we're actually testing for. Umm. So now let's go over to the implement stage, the Colab code. So created this code here. It's using the timelines from 2020. Umm. 20/21/2020. Umm, so it's going to compute the returns, visualize the key events, uh, it's going to classify the emhs. And if there's any violations, uh, per, it's going to. Yeah, it's gonna predict if it's a violation of the EMH. Umm, risk adjusted returns, abnormal returns. We got behavioral finance, herding and microstructure. Uh, so that's just to see if there's, you know, a short squeeze, panic, FOMO, that kind of thing, uh, rational investor profitability. So, you know, who's making money off of this, umm. And then just like a chart here. So the graph is just the timeline of the actual. Uh, closing prices through January of 2021, so as you can see there, that's the Reddit surge on the left uh, and then after that it just continued to increase uh, in price that peak close right there and then the, the peak high umm, the following day. So what this uh uncovered, the code showed the auto correlation of returns is a -0.258. The weak form EMH violated, that's true. Semi strong EMH violated true and strong form EMH violated true. So it's saying that all three Emhs were violated. Umm and the annualized Sharpe ratio is a 7.89. Umm. And then it it just gives some, uh. Summary here. And then this is just some explanation which I'll go over here in a second. So looking on the the right here. So the weak form image violates. So all three emhs were violated. So what does that mean for the weak form? That means past returns were predictive. Umm, so I mean it's kind of in the in the name there umm, the historical data was predictable for what was upcoming on the returns uh, so that was a violation for the semi strong. The public info did not immediately reflect in price umm. So that causes that violation. If the public did immediately, if the public info did immediately reflect in the price, that would be uh, it wouldn't be a violation, but it did. So that does make it a violation of semi strong Uh, and then the strong form was also violated because some participants had insider early information. Umm, this has been proven in the. Uh. With the Reddit surge and I'm pretty sure there's been some SEC investigations into people that played a role into this short squeeze. All right, so let's go over what it's telling us here. Umm, so it says the cumulative abnormal return, uh, was -127.25%? So that just shows that it was abnormal. Returns were extreme. So that shows that the umm event was driven in risk and vitality. Uh, it was a very. Unpre, uh, not unpredictable, but very, umm, kind of out of left field 'cause I remember this, uh, when it happened in, during the COVID years, umm, GameStop was about to go out of business and then the Reddit post, uh, Wall Street bets kind of coordinated to buy up all of the. Umm, the stocks and kind of raise the price and uh, especially because there was a lot of umm, investors that were betting against GameStop, so basically betting them to fail umm. And it was kind of, it was known as like a meme at the time. However, it had extremely high implications on the market and, you know, the future of the market and how people can now, you know, almost work together to to save a company or possibly put them out of business, depending on the situation. Uh, the Sharpe ratio is 7.89. That shows that it's a high risk adjusted return potential during the event. So it's very volatile, very risky, which is kind of uh. Just kind of. You know, warranted given the event. Very risky event, very volatile. Uh, so let's see here the. So some of the, uh, the reasoning. For uh. The violations here, so one could be FOMO or that short squeeze panic. So fear of missing out. People want to be in on it. They don't want to, you know, possibly lose money that they could have made. Uh, like I said earlier, the Reddit, the subreddit Wall Street bets drove coordinated retail buying. Umm. It limits the arbitrage broker restrictions like Robin Hood. Uh, they actually didn't allow people to trade umm GME for a short while. Umm, liquidity issues, market microstructure, high volume spikes, price volatility, uh, systematic profit opportunities existed post event. Umm, so that's a risk-adjusted returns. The sharp is greater than 0, which suggests high volatility opportunity. Umm, so there is opportunity to make money, but it's very risky umm. Information advantages existed for early retail participants and insiders, so that shows it's a violation of the strong form. Umm. Looking at active management could capture short-term games during the event. Passive management would miss event driven returns. Uh, so that just goes to show the type of management and how that could affect it. Umm, going down here I. To the to the evolve stage. So I did a second code in collab here uh and it just shows you know how much money you'd actually be making if you were to buy and trade on these specific days in 2021, umm, following the subreddit surge of the price umm so if you were to sell. On the 27th, that's 100 and 2% umm, return on investment. And if you were to wait another day, that's another 80% uh, increase on, on top of that 100% uh, so 180% increase, umm, in profitability just by, you know. Trading and buying at the at the right times. So definitely opportunities to profit off of this, especially with insider knowledge if you knew what was going to happen with those markets, which is what has been alleged to to occur. So, uh, let's go back here. Uh, where are the questions at? So we tested all the Emhs. All were violated. Uh, we distinguished them all. Umm, we validated the evidence, we analyzed the real world market events. Umm, that's what that code did. Apply the driver framework throughout integrated financial theories. Perfect. Umm. Just need to find. All right, here we go. So we found all the historical price data, uh, we tested umm, which were violated. We. Uh, now let's evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. I kind of already showed you that, uh, earlier with the second code, umm, but over here on the right, uh, I kind of just laid everything out, uh, with bullet points here. So early investors or insiders, uh, who bought GME before the Reddit surge had huge upside. Umm, because someone buying at, you know, $43 on January 13th could have sold, could have sold. $86 on January 27th. So that's, it's like 2 weeks and you're doubling your profit. So very high potential there. Except these investors exploited information advantages, umm, such as the timing of the social media buzz, insider knowledge, or you know, the unusual high short interest, umm, some momentum traders during the spike. So during the actual surge, how they could have made money. Uh, would be, you know, riding that short term momentum buying when prices were trending upward, umm, you know, due to FOMO, so you didn't want to miss out on the opportunity. So you might have bought a little higher, uh, than, you know. You wanted to with that it's high volatility umm and a lot of people had exit quickly uh before the price dipped because as you can see here. A huge spike during 2020 and 2021, and then from there it has just continued to decrease. Umm. I mean, in 2024 it was trading at $7.00. Or excuse me at. Just under $10.00. So you go from selling at $80.00 to selling at $10. That can be a huge downside and a a big loss. Umm for traders. Umm. Short sellers who covered early sell hedge funds or retail traders uh who shorted GME earlier may have profited uh, if they covered their shorts umm before the spike. However, if you did bet on the short and then that spike happened, you would lose everything umm, however. Looking now umm if you were to short GameStop now, it wouldn't be the the worst uh investment because it has already hit that spike that's very unlikely to happen again uh and as you can see year after year it's just decreased uh except for a little spike in the uh. In the start of 2025. Um, and then, yeah, like, uh, like the information provided, uh, Melvin Capitals, we had a 53% loss. Umm, so a late short covering short squeeze can cause enormous losses. Umm and then you have that Sharpe ratio of 7.89 in case there's returns per unit of risk were exceptionally high, which is rare in normal markets. Umm. So you know you wanted to create extreme profit potential if trades were timely, correct, but if not a very volatile and risky. Just reflecting on everything, uh, it's a little quote. The GME short Tweed shows a clash between EMH and behavioral finance. Prices deviated shortly from fundamentals, violating weak, semi strong, and strong form. EMH. Uh, investor herding, FOMO, and social media coordination created predictable patterns and abnormal profits. While EMH provides a baseline for efficiency, behavioral finance better explains the real-world market dynamics. Actually during extreme volatility, umm. So that's kind of just my overall summary of of this entire project here. Umm. So yeah, we did. Did 1, did 2, did 3. We compared them. And then we assess the behavioral finance explanations. Umm. So yeah, we went through a driver defining discover represent right here. Uh, implement with the code. We validated the code. Umm, and we evolved it with that second code and how people could profit off of this and then reflect if we just, uh, compared behavioral finance and EMH and what it does well and what it, it doesn't do well. Umm, and what you need. Uh, behavioral finance for because of those, you know, those real world market volatility, umm, and patterns. Umm, yeah. So I think that is everything here. Uh, we went over all the financial concepts here. Umm. Yes, so the behavioral biases would be that FOMO are hurting umm, which which happens if you, you know, maybe bought a little bit too high after the prices surged a little bit. Umm. But yeah, we went through, uh, went through the driver framework. I used uh, KISS for the code. Umm, and then we found all the data using, uh, Yahoo Finance and the GameStop, umm, price sticker here. Umm, so just I guess to go over it again, the week form pass prices and return data cannot predict future prices. Returns are random. Semi strong means all publicly available information is immediately incorporated into prices and then strong form uh, insider information cannot produce consistent profits. So we found all three of these were violated uh, because daily returns showed strong auto correlation. So. Prices help predict short-term moves for the semi-strong. It was violated because public information such as the Reddit posts, the news, or the short interest data did not immediately reflect in prices. Delayed reaction and it created abnormal returns, uh, which people use to their advantage to, you know, make a good, good profit on the opportunity. And then strong form was violated because early insiders and, you know, traders exploited the timing advantages, uh, to, you know, increase their profit. And it showed that the private knowledge had value and they were able to profit off of it. So in summary, image predicts efficient, largely unpredictable prices, but GME uh, displayed predictable, extremely volatile prices. Uh, abnormal returns, hurting behavior, uh, social media influence contradicted EMH, while the behavioral finance explains the anomalies. Uh, so for a good financial analysis, you want to be able to use the EMH, uh, but also use behavioral finance to explain some of those things that EMH can't, can't explain. Um, so that's going to be everything. Um, thanks for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Okay, so today we're going to be talking about GameStop stock price change during the December 2020 and the January December or January 2021 market. We're going to be looking about did their price change violet violate any market efficiency principles? Did any investors profit by any insider work? Could the average investor profit? And then the key points of the case are that the August 20th, 2020 stock price ch stock price was wrong and that it is not 4. It is $1.15, which isn't a whole lot better than 4 cents when it's going to be rising to the rate that we see. However, it's not as an extreme number as the four cents compared to the$1.15, which at least makes it look like it is a company that is reliable and not a $4 like penny stock. So, that is an important note. And then I have the timeline, which is August 20th, that they're near bankruptcy. Uh they have a new leader takeover.Reddit starts to promote the stock. it surges to $483 in one day. This is the January 21st day. And I looked, according to ABC Finance, the $483 was just an intraday peak, which means that that's what it was traded for one point throughout the day. However, it settled around $94 for that day. So, it didn't close on the market at 300 or $400. That is incorrect technically but it did reach that number. So looking back at the history of GameStop to understand what they really went through and why their price shot up and then uh the reason why their price shot up like it did and it was such a big deal. So GameStop was at 2020 during COVID they were starting to decline especially during 2021 because PC gaming and console gaming wasn't as big of a deal. everything was starting to shift to an online presence. So, they started to lose like the instore feel, which is what GameStop was known for because if you're not going to go to the store to buy games, you're just going to start buying them online. And the company started to appropriate for that, making GameStop feel like a third irrelevant middleman leading to their industry dying. So, then they had a new over new owner take over where they were in a time of disarray. Meanwhile, on a Reddit, uh it was r/wall street bets. So, yes, a formal company like um so they were like formal, but they were not looking at Wall Street. They were more like taking bets or unofficial action. It wasn't not Wall Street affiliated. So it becomes like this meme stock or joke gaining celebrity attack attention as we can see by Elon Musk tweeted out the Reddit that game that everybody was promoting uh GameStop stock to uh implying that he wants to make it rise and bring back GameStop. I have the screenshot of Yahoo Finance as well, showing if we look at the numbers, how it just really increased during this period of celebrity attention and kind of being made fun of to seem like a joke because it was like everybody loves GameStop. We don't want to see the company go out of business, so we're going to offer our support for it and maybe make a little money. So that was kind of the philosophy behind everyone's point of view when they were investing into the GameStop stock. So today we're going to do the market efficiency test versus behavioral finance and just explain how that is a problem and how this relates to this issue. Calculate abnormal returns in communive abnormal returns or the C. Gather GameStop prices using Yahoo Finance as an accurate source. Evaluate the risk adjusted. Is this market predictable is something we're going to be looking for. And then other things are the price behavior compared to the prediction. Is there a large discrepancy? What other behaviors could uh explain this anonymally? Uh, and then did GMV GME violate all three of the market efficiency test? So, going straight into the code, I worked with Gemini to create all of the graphs that I made using Yahoo as a reference for the stock prices and all the other information as it is so easily accessible. I was just able to import Yahoo as one of the accesses for collab. So that was absolutely incredible making my life a lot easier. So this is the stock price uh representation of GameStop stock through August from August 20th to January 2025. So as we can tell GameStop is doing horrible in 2020. their stock is down in the dirt. And then when that January 2021 reaches towards late January 21, the stock immediately peaks to what we know is a high of $94.93. Causing a fall off directly after because most people would sell as reflected by they wanted to make money was the major point behind uh bringing Gamestock back. So most people thought of it as an investment. However, as we can tell, the varying degree at which it was being sold throughout the day heavily influenced whether or not you were going to be actually making money or not. And then ever since it had a bounceback in August of the next year, so about a year, maybe people invested more into their game stock or game stop stock in hopes that it might do better or grow in the future. But it is just a steady decline till about 2024, another 3 years after the event. Slight increase. You never know what the market game could have released, something like that. But overall, it's been decreasing and has never reached the amount that it was during the January 2021 where it got all this propaganda., yep.

Okay. So here is the cumulative market returns where we're going to start talking talking about the market efficiency test. So this is the abnormal returns percentage for GameStop from the years 2021 and January. Sorry, this is just a month from February and 2021. So first off talking about weak forms in the market efficiency test. This would be if we look at historical data or have no other information other than our own intuition and things that we can gather in front of us by looking at the company's information that we should we're going to invest in them. So if I saw a stock that was trending upward I would invest money in that and that would be a weak form. However, this was violated as there was no historical data that showed there was going to be an increase in GameStop stock and it was a complete abnormality. The semi- strong form would be using public forums such as Reddit or like a stock trading website to look at what stocks are doing better and then using that to buy the stock. And then a strong form violation would be or a strong form would be when you have insider information that this like a company is about to like release a new phone and you invest in Apple or something where you directly know their p their price is about to go up so you invest before that. All three of these were violated by from the market efficiency test as it is an abnormality that could not be explained from any of these forms showing that it is a completely different entity in and of itself. As we know the average return went from about 0% rising up from 100 to 400% before it averaged out at about 250%. showing just completely crazy all over the board unexpected the return for GameStop's price was and very low predictability as I said and the price was driven up through social media and what seemed to be jokes or hopeful 

a hope for the future I should say for GameStop to do better and just love that company that so many people grew up with. So, as we can tell, GameStop did violate all the forms from here as the market data doesn't suggest there's anything. Reddit didn't suggest that it was going to be rising this much and there was no insider trading because GameStop was not doing very good at the time. This was all based on behavioral finance as we'll find out later on. So this was not anything that could have been predicted in the financial scope necessarily. So that's what we are saying with our implement stage. So validate checking with the code. I kind of talked about my experience with the coding. It was very simple. Yahoo finance and collab did a very good job. I got a very good uh symbiotic relationship between the two. So I heavily use that to interpret these results. And this verified data about the short interest and the volume I all conser or I confirmed using ABC finance which is how I also confirmed the $483 uh intraday peak which is very interesting. I learned a lot through that ABC article and it helped me understand a lot of what we're going through in this case. So I found it very helpful. Um and then looking at the the short squeeze abnor abnormal returns graph. This just once again validates our claim that the uh forms were completely blown out of the water and there was no predicting the amount or return that we were going to get back from our investment when investing in GameStop between this specific time. And it also brings up the X post and X anti-terms showing that short-term profits at a high risk um for the X post. And so the the meaning for this is when we look in the past so or when X post is looking in the past and X aantie is looking in the future. So looking back from the past, it was obvious that we should have invested January 21st and literally sold the next day to make a bunch of money, but that wasn't the case for everybody as we know. And but a lot of people did do that. And Xanti was predicting when the peach would reach its height. So this this is what we'd see as more of like an expost problem as X anti would be very hard or almost impossible to predict when it would reach its peak as GameStop was not a very stable stock and was relying solely on the support of the people to increase its stock price and not other things like it should have like its product. Um so this is where we're going to talk about the behavioral bias. I mean this is how many people were influenced into buying the stock. This is pro. This is when GameStop started to go under and under new leadership. And this is when the Reddit post was posted in rstap r/wolf of or wall street bets. So yeah, the behavioral bias was a large part of this incident. Uh hurting large groups of people online saw the rising stock in game rising stock of GameStop and wanted to invest. Fear of missing out. Everyone else is going to make money off this. I need to as well. And then overconfidence. Well, since everyone else has invested into this stock, I can't lose money, right? Nope, that is not the case. They are doing other things. They have different motives. They might have already cashed out by the time that you've invested. So this was just a major cause of social media influencing the rise of this price that allowed it to soar so high and even allowed or even made Robin Hood restrict how much GameStop you could buy as its abnormal return was so all over the place and it was just surging and they saw it as unrealistic as I mean look at this. You're not you don't know what you're making when you invest in GameStop. It could be in one thing the next and another thing the other. So they did that to save their butts. Kind of looking on to the reflect, we see how EMH versus behavioral finance is important as EMH shows the long-term price changes and behavioral finance offers an explanation for the short-term chaos. So the EMH shows us that this was not possible through the financial lens and then the behavioral finance offers us an explanation for this short-term chaos pretty much. And the active result was the explanation where people are buying and selling rapidly to increase their profits. And this would be an example of active management in this case. And passive strategies are looking into the market and predicting when it's going to rise and fall kind of like an X anti sort of move. So looking at the market efficiency policy implications uh they trade halted trade. Robin Hood did at least other companies did not. And then have a margin where if it's swaying so much um have it so it limits at maybe 90 and um or caps at 90 and limits at like 60 for that period of time and then change that depending on the day. So overall Reddit and the online culture led to a shock of the Gamestock price increasing so rapidly leading to a unknown financial relationship that violated EMH standards and could be explained using EMH and behavioral finance.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, how are you? This
is my session eight assignment. So again,
as normal on the left, I have my actual like
written summary and kind of what I use to
understand the assignment as a whole. And on
the right, I have the actual code that
we'll go through first. So starting up here,
we have all of our import statements.
Again, these are standard pretty much across
any of our assignments nowadays, especially
because they're getting a little
bit more complex. So we have all of our
import statements. And it also says this time
like from so where we're importing it
from. And it's kind of this little bit
more towards like the data and really
understanding the data and what goes on with
that aspect of it. Moving forward, then
the first thing that we have, and I try
to always add some sort of comments or
something into the codes that when I
look back at it later for my future
reference, I at least understand a little
bit more and I kind of know what I was
planning on doing here. So firstly, we have
the defined constants in Windows, which is
the R stage, right? So then we have the
ticker GME, which we're just saying is GME,
and then ticker market. And then we have
S&Ps at 500 here. Then next, we have
our estimation window. So this is the pre
-event for market model, which is one year
prior to initial rally. And so setting the dates,
we have our estimated start date and our
estimated end date. So estimated start date
is going to be August 1st, 2019, and estimated
end date is going to be one year later
on August 1st, 2020. Then we have the
baseline window. So for volume slash normal
price comparison, which is the August to
October 2020 range, we again have our baseline
start. So baseline start here is going to
pick up exactly where the estimated end here
is. So August 1st, 2020 as well. And
then baseline end is going to be through
Halloween, so October 31st. Then our event
window, essentially we're just setting our
dates so we know what range we're looking at
as far as time-wise. Event window is going
to be the core squeeze period, so for AR
slash car calculations. It's going to be
January 1st, 2021 through February
28th, 2021, so basically two
months entirely. Then we have August
2020 for precise fact-checking,
so August start, which is just going
to be the start of August and the
end of August. Now here, this is one
thing that's a little bit different from some
of the code that we've done. where now we're
downloading necessary data and stuff that
we need for the actual code in general. So
here we're downloading all necessary data in
one go, which includes the full period. So
then an important fix here is that you're
forcing auto-adjust, which is false. So we keep
adjust close and then high-volume columns.
So this is all the data that we're putting in
here. As you can see, ticker GME and then
ticker market as well. Then again, our
start, estimated start, and our event
end, which is numbers that we just went
over. And the auto-adjust is going
to go to false. Then number two,
we're going to have our fact verification
module. So this is its first stage,
which fulfills the D stage verification
in that sense. So we're defining the
check fact verification, and we're using
the data there. Again, this comment
here just kind of explains what's
going on. So what does this actually
mean? It means that we're verifying the
professor's claims about GME price
in August 2020 and confirm the pre
-price specifically. So here it's going
to do a regular print statement,
which we'll see a little bit more later
during my output. But it's going to
correctly slice August 2020 data.
So August 2020 data equals data from
the adjacent close, ticker GME location,
.loc, sorry, August start date
to August end date. And then our minimum
price is going to be whatever the
August 2020 data, the minimum of that was,
and then the August 2020 data, the maximum
that is. So we're essentially taking
our data that we've already imported into
our code and we're pulling numbers
directly from it and we're setting our
min price and our max price to use later
in our calculations. Here are more
print statements where we go over
claim verification, stated price
in August 2024. Then here, actual
GME, and then more print statements
in that sense. Next, we have the use
dynamic comparison logic. So this is the
ratio to claim, which is, again, we're using
that min price. And the minimum price is
what we pulled from the original data that
we're importing into the code. And we're dividing
it by that 0.04. Then here, it's going
to show what the conclusion of that is.
So the conclusion is that the $0.04 claim is
incorrect. Actual prices were roughly, and it's
going to show what the ratio to claim was,
higher than claimed. So this here is just
essentially saying that we know that it's
incorrect, but it's going to pull in the
exact numbers in this ratio to claim, and
it's going to format it to one decimal as a
float. And so we're going to know exactly what
is being pulled in here, and then we're
going to know that it was higher than what
we originally claimed. Then we have the
check January 2021, which is the
peak price claim. So January 2021 high
is essentially what we're labeling our
variable as, which is data high, and then we
have the ticker GME. So, again, these are
the same dates that we talked about
before, so going from January 1st through
the end of January, and we're doing the maximum
of that, which is why it's the January
2021 high. We're essentially taking
our data that we have, we're separating it
into this specific ticker GME, and then
this specific date range, and then we're
pulling the max from that date range to put
into this variable. Then here are more
print statements, so we can see claim
verification stated peak surge was $483 in
January 2021. So essentially the max
value that we were able to get from this Jan
2021 high is 483. Then we have the
actual GME in Jan 2021, which is peak, and then
it's going to pull in what that value is,
which we'll see later. This is again just
a print statement, trying to get
formatting a little bit better
and nicer there. Then we have the
volume analysis, which is the
first stage here, which fulfills week
from test input. So we're defining the
volume analysis using the data, and that's
going to essentially calculate and compare
volume between the baseline and event
periods, addressing the tenfold claim that
we talk about later in the assignment so
print we have the volume analysis week from
test input and just again i do have all of
the information that kind of summarizes
what the product what the session assignment
is about and kind of what i did to get
there but i think at least like generically
going through um the original code and
kind of understanding where that code came
from and then we'll get to that aspect
after um then we have the volume analysis
week from test input volume gme is the data
volume and then wrap the ticker gme this
calculate basically baseline volume August
to October 2020. So baseline volume is
equal to the volume GME, baseline start, baseline
end, again our time range, and then we're
finding the mean of that. So that's why I
just calculating the base volume from these
dates. So we're calculating it from the August to
October 2020, which I'm pretty sure it
started from August 1st and then through end
of October. Then we're calculating event
volume in the same way. So January 2021, the
peak month, sorry about that, there's some
background noise. The January 2021, which is
the peak month, event volume equals volume
gme then we have our volume ratio which is
event volume over baseline volume and again more
print statements here that are going to
make a little bit more sense going forward so
average daily volume we're using this baseline
using our peak month that we just calculated
and then the ratio between them so as you
can tell this is stuff that we had just
calculated and now we're going to kind of output
them and see how they compare to each other
because that's the whole point right how
to compare the numbers so in conclusion here
we can see that the volume ratio that we're
formatting again to two decimal places increases
empirically confirms the retail volume
spike, indicating massive trading activity,
which we'll explain a little bit further
and kind of what that means in reference of
it. Then we have the core event study and
significance testing. So the run event study
data, and then we have calculated daily returns.
So our returns equal data, the adjacent
close, PCTChange.dropNA, RGME, which is the
returns for it, and then returns for the ticker
market. Then we have our market model
estimation, which is the R stage of implementation
and essentially again using the same
range of dates so the estimated start
estimated n and then drop na for these I decided
that a graph would be the best way to
understand these which is why you can see that
for the model there's the y and x so I'm
not going to spend too much time going through
the actual code of how it works just
because for me personally I feel like I understand
the actual graph a little bit better
than the code but you can see the code here
and it drops any of the missing values safely
it's just a little bit easier to see it
because I personally think that a graph was
the best way to output all the data so we
understand it a little better. Then we have
our market model estimation and our alpha
intercept beta systematic risk model R squared
and then again another print statement
to make sure that we're printing our lines
and things like that that we need. Then
we move into our AR calculation our first
stage so our GME event and then again we're using
the same data range and I think that's
kind of the main thing that you see is that
all of our calculations for this homework is
we're pulling numbers from the data and
we're using this to calculate and then
making an assumption or proving an assumption
wrong based off of that. Then we have our
expected event which is going to be the alpha
hat plus beta hat times the r market event
and then ar event is going to be the rgme
event minus the r expected event and this
is abnormal returns which is what that ar
stands for cumulative abnormal returns
which is what that car stands for and then
abnormal return results so semi-strong slash
weak test total car is going to be january
1st through february 2028 we'll see this a
little bit more later and you can see the
different variations here again we're
formatting the two decimal places we're taking
that car event which is that again cumulative
abnormal returns Then we have the
print statement here, which is the statistical
significance test. So this is kind of
the entire part where statistics comes in
in some sort of way where it's either
are we rejecting this hypothesis or are we
accepting the hypothesis, or we're not rejecting
the hypothesis, I think is the more
proper way to say it. Then we have a
one-sample t-test, which is testing
if the mean AR is significantly
different from zero. So we're going to use
a t-statistic and a p -value that we already
have, and we're going to put this into our
stats test. It's going to drop the NENs
before test. again null hypothesis and we're
going to prove it a little bit more i have a
few like diagrams and graphs at the bottom
that i think help explain this really really well
so we'll keep forward to that so here we
know if p value is less than 0.05 so we're
assuming the alpha value in this case is 0.05
we're assuming p value less than 0.05 so
we reject the null hypothesis this
means ar is statistically
significant confirming market
inefficiency so essentially like we have
our hypothesis are we proving or disproving
it using these numbers else if we find that
the p value is not less than the 0.05 and it's
actually greater than we fail to reject null
hypothesis and that's kind of what i was
talking about a little bit earlier where it's
not necessarily we reject and we accept
but it's more we reject or we fail to reject and
ar is not significantly statistically significant
moving forward we have our visualization
model all of this honestly the axes
etc i can like show you all the code here but
most of it is just going to go into what
the actual graph making is and this is something
that i did multiple prompts with um gemini
and i even like tried to help it a little
bit because originally just gave me the
numbers and honestly had a very very slim output
but for me one of the things that I first
needed was I know I needed comments so I
took the time to put in comments into the code
and after I got the comments into the code
and I made sure okay if I looked back at this
code six months from now would I be able
to understand what's going on then I moved
into okay what's like a better way to explain
and show this data and I think a visual display
is obviously always the best way to go so
I decided to go with the graph and I prompted
AI a little bit on what colors to use and
what to make the axes and such which will
be a little bit more easy to explain when I
kind of go back down. This execution block
is basically fact -checking, it's going
to verify all the data, then we're doing the
volume analysis, then there's a core event
and significance test, this is the
accept or reject, then the visualization
which is the all of the actual charts and stuff
we have, as you can see it's a little
preview of some of them, and then we have
the print statements where it's going to
show print statements. So now I'm actually
going to take a minute and kind of switch over
to the other aspect which is the overview.
So this is kind of, the left side is honestly
what I do consistently just because I think
that it's something that I need to understand
the code and understand the assignment as
a whole so overview the assignment analyzes
how much return investors require from three
different companies based on risk levels
so we're using their um oh I'm so sorry this is
the wrong I'm so sorry about that this is
the wrong one I think this is my old one that
kind of pulled into there so um if you
give me one minute I'll pull up the right one
real quickly okay sorry about that I think I
accidentally copied and pasted the wrong one
here so moving forward a little bit essentially
what each part of the code does right
so an explanation and that's kind of what I put
into it like a friendly explanation of this
so originally we're gonna set up our imports
and our time windows which is what we went
over at the beginning so we have our estimation
window essentially what each of these
estimation windows really mean is used to
calculate for example the first one is what normal
GMU returns should look like within that
range then we have our baseline volume window
which is going to be used to measure used to
measure normal trading volumes and used to
calculate what normal gme returns should look
like then the event window is going to
say the short squeeze period where you examine
the abnormal rates august 2020 window is
going to be for fact checking just the 0.04
claims remember we saw earlier the four percent
or not four percent sorry excuse me four
cent claim and kind of how we can approve and
disprove that so the august 2020 window
that data was pulled specifically to prove or
disprove that specifically next we downloaded
the data this is the part that i thought was
honestly really different from any of their
homeworks or session assignments that we've
done, which I really enjoyed, was that the
data was a lot more, it was like we had actual
data that we were pulling from and not just
made up numbers, which I really appreciated.
And so this is just a little bit about the
data downloading. Then we go into fact
verification. So we checked fact verification.
It does two essential things. One, we're
verifying August 2020 price. So they're doing GME's
price between August 1st to 31st of 2020,
and we're calculating the real min and max
price. So this is what we see a little bit
earlier in the code, or we're actually calculating
the price. Then we're taking that
calculator price and we're complaining we're
comparing them to the claim that four cents in
august 2020 is kind of what the norm was and
the result of this that we did see a little
bit earlier which you can see down here as
well um should be here so stated price 0.04 in
august 2020 actual gme this and we can see
this 0.04 claim is incorrect actual prices
were 25.9 times higher than claimed and that's
kind of what you can see here so um actual
prices around four dollars not four percent
so maybe here it says 25.9 but here it says
around 100 times i think the 25.9 is a little
bit more accurate this is more math that i
kind of did a little bit on myself and tried
to put it through and kind of tried to get
some ai to help me as well so this verify
and then the next thing that we move on to is
verifying january 2021 and that intraday peak
so we use the high column to find the
exact peak price in jan in january and it concerns
that confirms that 483 dollars is the
preak so that right here is we're going to
see the claim verification it's going to say
stated peak surge let me see if i can make
this a little bit bigger here just so it's
a bit easier to see. We're going to see
the claim verification state of peace search
483 in January 2021. So essentially everything
that's on the left is going to correspond
with everything that's on the right. I
just personally think the information on the
left is a little bit more flushed out and
I do realize that the flushed out version
is not something that you can really have
as far as like in the input for the code just
because you do want to focus on keeping it
a little bit cleaner on that end. So I
normally tend to try and make a little bit more
of a me version of the information on the
left hand side here. And then this satisfies
the critical first step of my assignment
that's kind of what was going on volume
analysis is the weak form price in the volume
test so we're using the volume analysis
function which we saw which calculates the
baseline average volume event average volume
and the ratio and we have the different
formulas here which we went over already so
I won't bore you with going over them again
and it's kind of where we are right here
volume analysis so it shows you like the
baseline that we use for each of these so average
daily volume average daily volume and how
many shares came as a result of that so
if the ratio is close to 10 times this
confirms the claim that retail trading exploded
during the squeeze. This provides empirical
evidence from weak form market activity
price and volume patterns. So we can see here
there's a volume increase ratio from the
January 2021 baseline, which is 5.81. So we
can see that there was an increase here.
And the conclusion is that the 5.81 increase
empirically confirms the retail volume spike,
indicating massive trading activity. So
because we can see that there is such a
difference between the baseline from August,
October to January 2021, we know that there is
a spike here and we do see the massive trading
activity difference here which proves what
we were originally thinking moving on
to market model and abnormal result abnormal
returns sorry about that i just took an exam
so i think i'm a little bit all over the place
but um the function is the run event
studies so this is the most important analytical
section of the kind of assignment in
general where you're estimating the normal
gme return and then we have our estimated
this is exactly pulled directly from the code
it's something i just copied and pasted over
but it gives a little more insight so the
regression gives the alpha which is the
intercept the beta which is gme sensitivity to
the market and then the R-squared, which is
the fit of the model. This is the baseline
of the expected return model, which I'll show
a little bit later. So again, these are
more calculations, which we've already
seen and kind of going over a little bit in
the code. But going over here, we can
see the total car, which as we discussed,
for this range specifically, 3.8879,
which is IE 388.79%. So the max daily AR is
going to be 1.3754. And we're going to
see it shows the total buildup of abnormal
performance. This directly tests semi
-strong efficiency. Moving on, we have
our t-test for EMH violation. So this
is the same thing that we said because
we know that the p -value is less than
the 0.05 claim, which is going to be
statistical significance. It's going to show
it right here, the validate stage,
right? Like, how can we validate this hypothesis?
So our original null hypothesis, which
is, in this case, the way statistics
works, is what we're assuming is going to be
true, is that the mean AR in event window
equals 0, right? Market is efficient. That's
what we're assuming. Now, mean AR, we
have 0.102313. T statistic that we
got is 1.63, but the real value that we
want to look at is 0 .116. So the conclusion
is that 0.116 is greater than 0.05, so we
fail to reject null. AR is not statistically
significant, right? And so for this, I kind
of had a few different visualizations and
stuff that I thought would make it a little
bit easier. But before that, I did want to
go through and kind of showcase what my driver
cheat sheet was and where I use driver
specifically in the assignment. So for D,
Define and Discover, I first identify like the core
research question, which is, did the GME
event violate market efficiency? And that's
kind of the big thing that we're focusing
on. I probably should have started with that,
but that's kind of what the assignment
focuses on. And this is the needed information.
So we need historical prices, volume, market
proxy, and an event timeline, right? We need
the historical prices just so we know what
we're comparing to. We obviously need an
event timeline so we know the range of time for
our data that we have. Key claims that we
need to verify is the $0.04 price in August
2020, the $483 peak price, and that 10 times
retail volume spike. So R for represent
is going to say, you design how
the analysis will work. This is a market
model regression to compute the
expected returns, event study windows,
estimation windows. This is where I use
AR, CAR, and T-test to evaluate that EMH.
This is the game plan stage. It's kind of
the way that I read it when I looked online
a little bit more. This is where I'm
actually starting to understand, okay, this
is what I'm planning on doing, and this is how
I'm going to do it. Implement. This is
my code. This is me implementing my Python.
This is me going to Gemini and prompting
it over and over again and trying to get the
code that I want and the visualizations
that I personally want. And so moving forward,
then, that's, like, the downloading the
data. This is me fact -checking, like, the
claims, things like that, computing AR, running
a significant sense, and finally generating
the plots that are at the bottom here. Next,
we have validate. This is where we do
the, we decide what the results mean, right?
We're interpreting any of the results that we
got. So we're checking if it's statistically
significant, which is this entire last
section here, right? Are we rejecting the null?
Are we failing to reject the null? In
that sense, all of those things. Then E involves
what does this mean for active versus
passive investing? What does this teach about
risk and short selling? Things more like that.
How can we use this to discuss implications
going forward? Finally, we have reflect,
which is to tie the EMH and behavioral
finance together. This is overconfidence,
things like limits to arbitrage, things like
that. So reflect on what GME events reveal about
real world markets. Now getting into
a little bit more of the more important
stuff, in my opinion, is
understanding these visualizations. So
I'm going to full screen just to show
the visualization. So our first graph
is going to be the GME price
behavior and key events from the
August 20th to 2021. So I have a little
key here that I did have Gemini put in
just because I thought personally it was
really confusing. The blue line is going
to do our GME price that adjusted close.
So we can see there's a spike here that's
a little bit later. So a little bit later,
we can assume it's maybe closer to the end
of that February 2021 period, maybe a little
bit into 2021 there. Then we have the stake
for the September 20th, which is going
to be this green line here. Then the squeeze
peak trading restrictions that we have. So
going into my analysis again a little bit what
it is, the graph shows how GameStop's price
moved leading into and out of the short
squeeze. So the graph shows the blue line,
the GME adjusted closing price over time. The
green dashed line is that 13% stake that
Ryan Cohen bought. this is the first major
catalyst the market started believing gme could
turn around red vertical is going to be january
2027 this is sorry january 27th 2021 the
peak of the squeeze right so this is where
everything kind of took its like had it
was at its highest point this is retail demanded
exploded while short interest was still
greater than 120 this is the part that i
really want to focus on the why it matters why
does this visualization matter it visually
proves no offense Mr. No offense, Professor
Zhang, but it proves that your claim was
wrong. In August 2020, GME was around 3
to 5, not 0.04. And that's something that
we can see here a little bit with the prices
on the Y axis there. So we can see that
this is not clear. You can clearly see
the climb into the squeeze and the explosive
peak at that 483. So not only are we
proving it with numbers, but now you can
physically see it with your eyes using the
data that we imported. Next, we have
the GME trading volume, which is
on the right here. So trading volume is
going to have, again, a little bit of a key
thing we're going to see that we have volume
millions of shares on the left side and
that's kind of what our graph looks like
and so this bar chart shows how many shares
were traded each day from scaled into millions
just to make it a little bit more
readable the graph shows baseline trading which
is 5 to 30 million shares a day and then
the peak squeeze which is this area right
here it's going to show the 500 to 800 million
shares a day again why does this matter that
confirms the statement that retail trading
volume increased 10 times or more we can
see it increase taking this peak here for
example i hope you can see my cursor compared
to something over here we can see that
10x increase a little more. The spikes align
perfectly with the price explosion which
shows clear herding behavior and extreme
market attention there. Finally the last graph
here is going to be the cumulative absorption
returns which is that car during event
window of the January 1st of February 2021
and the line is going to show the actual car
value and so the graph shows how much GME's
return deviated from what is predicted to
return and it shows the starts near zero no
abnormal movement and it spikes to over 400
percent. The abnormal returns during the
squeeze so why this matters ultimately the
car plot provides direct evidence of emh so we
see that it's large sustained statistically
significant abnormal returns which violate
strong market efficiency market prices did
not instantly adjust to this information
but they were driven by behavioral forces
coordination and constraints basically short
covering and trading restrictions so how
the graphs fit together we see that for the
price chart we see price jumps far beyond
fundamentals volume massive retail buying frenzy
where everyone wanted to buy everything at
that point which is because the high shares
per day and then the car chart is the huge
abnormal returns so we can see that this
is semi-strong form likely violated hurting
things like that and then market model
cannot explain the event together it shows that
there's a coordinated social media driven
bubble inefficiency and short-term price
formation and there's a clear like behavioral
finance mechanism here like hurting overconfidence
we can see that the market moves
collectively together and then we see limister
the arbitrage here which is the hedge fund
short squeeze prevented rational correction
so overall this is my assignment I hope it
made sense to you but this is a little bit
way of how I decided to take it on so you can
see I have my general output and then I
have the graphs that honestly help me understand
the information a little bit more but
yeah that's it thank you",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Okay, so this is the driver analysis for
session eight um the GameStop short
squeeze and market efficiency.
So for define and discover, I define the
problem. So the objective is to
investigate the GameStop short squeeze
event as a case study for market
efficiency. Um I need to analyze
GameStop's price behavior against
predictions of the efficient market
hypothesis. And this involves testing
which form of efficient market
hypothesis weak, semi- strong or strong,
was violated, assessing explanations
from behavioral finance, evaluating if
systematic profit opportunities existed
for a rational investor and verifying
all factual claims in the assignment
prompt. So for the discover step um so
the prompt contains a critical first
step and that is to verify a specific
numerical claim that GameStop traded at
4 cents in August of 2020. And so
initially I used Google search to find
historical GameStop price data for
August 2020. And the search results for
the GameStop GameStop stock price of
August 2020 show a price range and not a
single value. Um, one result provides a
table for August 2020 with prices
ranging from a dollar4 cents to $167.
And another result shows prices for all
of 2020 with a low of 0.85 85 in April
of 2020 and prices around 1.15
in August of 2020. So my initial
conclusion is that the prompt statement
that GameStop traded at 4 cents is
definite definitely false.
Um the actual price in August 2020 was
significantly higher likely in the
dollar to 1.7 range and the all-time low
in 2020 was also much higher around
0.85. 85.
So this discrepancy is a critical
finding and will be the first item I
validate with primary data source. Um
Yahoo Finance is what I'll be using in
the implementation stage. For the
remainder of the analysis, the verified
data will be used as my numbers.
So in the represent stage, um this stage
is planning out the how. Um it's how I
will model the problem, what data I will
use, and what steps I'll take. So my
data source, I'll be using the Y finance
library in Python to pull historical
stock data. This is a st a standard and
reliable source for financial analysis.
Um some of the data I'll need is the
ticker GME, the time period,
um January 1st of 2020 to today,
November 12th, 2025.
um some data points adjusted close price
which accounts for splits and dividends
and volume some tools the Y finance for
data acquisition and map plot library
for data visualization
so some of the analytical steps I'll be
taking in the implementation stage I'll
be importing the libraries and
downloading the GameStop data um I will
also be executing the critical first
step by
generating two plots to visualize the
event. So plot one will be a line chart
of GameStop adjusted close price from
2020 to the present. This will visually
show the near bankruptcy level, the Ryan
Cohen buyin period, mass spike in
January 2021 and the subsequent
stabilization.
Um plot two will be bar chart of
GameStop volume over the same period.
This must be aligned with price chart to
show the massive increase in trading
volume during the squeeze. And so during
the validation, I will analyze the
charts and data to test the EMH.
Um for the weak form violation, does the
show chart show predictability?
Um for the semi strong form violation,
did the price reflect all public
information? And this is the core of the
analysis. So, some of the information,
um, high short interest, 140% was
public. Ryan Cohen's 13% stake was
public, which is the SEC filing, and the
Wall Street Bets campaign was public.
The analysis, um, the price explosion to
40 $483 was disconnected from
fundamental value. The analyst estimates
estimates 10 to $40.
The market failed to incorporate this ma
this public information rationally. This
is a clear and massive violation of
semi- strong form efficiency.
So for strong form violation since semi-
strong is violated strong form which
includes all private info is also
violated by definition.
So
another step of the validation is I'm
going to be applying behavioral finance
concepts. So hurting in social media,
the event was driven by a coordinated
self-reinforcing herd of retail
investors via the Reddit thread wall
street vets
and also has confirmation bias and
overconfidence. Investors sought
information that confirmed their to the
moon thesis and believe they could not
lose
and just there are some limits to
arbitrage and this is the rational
explanation for why the price remained
wrong. So for the implementation stage
um this stage details the final code
used to conduct the analysis um the
implementmentation was performed in
Google Collab to ensure a consistent and
reliable environment. The first command
installs the Y finance library
and then the main script then imports
libraries, downloads the data, performs
the critical fact check required by the
prompt and generates the two necessary
um visualizations. I did have a few
iterations of this code. So the charts
do not accurately represent what I
intended to represent. They still have
the same data but not the same chart
format.
So here is the code as you can see it
installs the Y finance libraries library
imports the other libraries which is map
plot library
um downloads the GameStop data from Y
finance
executes the critical first steps this
is going to verify the claim that
GameStop traded at 4 cents in August
2020 with the Y finance data.
It will then also filter the data to
only include August of 2020 to make this
fil like the data search a little bit
easier. And then the if statement checks
if we found data.
So then
this is where we find the single lowest
close price and store it.
And then it'll just print that. So then
the next step is to create the
visualizations. So it will plot the GME
price and this plots the co price and
then
it will also plot the volume.
So as you can see here
um here's the first chart. This chart is
the most important. It shows the stock
price was flat and very low around a
dollar to $2 for most of 2020. And then
in January 21, it explodes upward and
near in a nearly vertical line to its
peak price. And after the peak, it
crashes down but settles at a new normal
price that is still much higher than the
2020 levels.
So here is the second chart. Um, this
chart lines up perfectly with the price
chart. It shows almost no trading volume
for all of 2020. And then in January
2021, at the exact same time as the
price spike, the volume explodes,
showing a massive number of shares were
being traded.
And this is the visual proof of the
retail frenzy.
So our validation of the critical first
step, um the Python script produced the
following definitive output. The actual
low price of August 2020 was $104.
And so the conclusions prompts claim is
verifiably false. Um this confirms the
initial discover finding. Um the
prompt's claim of or sense is incorrect
by a factor of over 25 and this analysis
will proceed using the correct verified
data.
So just some observations based on the
charts.
Um the price chart clearly shows the
stock trading in the$1 to $2 range
throughout mid 2020 um which is the near
bankruptcy levels. It then shows a near
vertical spike in January 2021 peaking
at over $80 or $483 pre-split.
Um a fact we can cite from our initial
research. After the peak, the price
crashes but stabilizes at a new normal
far higher than the 2020 lows.
And so another observation, um the
volume chart is just as dramatic. It
shows near zero trading volume for most
of 2020 and then explodes in January
2021, perfectly matching the price
spike. This visually confirms the
10-fold increase in retail trading and
shows the massive coordinated market
event.
So in testing the EMH forms, um weak
form was violated. The weak worm states
that past price and volume data cannot
be used to predict future prices. The
GameStop event was partially fueled by
momentum and more importantly retail
investors use publicly available
technical data to explicitly cause the
price move. The success of this strategy
based on public technicals is a clear
violation of weak form efficiency. Um
semi- strong form was severely violated.
This is the core of the analysis. The
semi-strong form states that prices
adjust quickly and rationally to all
publicly available information. So
public info was that GameStop's high
short interest and Ryan Con's buyin and
the entire Wall Street Bets campaign
were all public. So the market reaction
to that was the price did not move to a
rational new equilibrium based on
fundamentals.
um it exploded to a price
to an insane price completely detached
from any fundamental value. This was a
clear failure of the market to
incorporate public information
rationally. The price was driven by
sentiment and market mechanics which was
the squeeze and not fundamentals. So
then strong form was also violated since
semi- strong form was violated. Strong
form is also violated by default.
So a behavioral finance finance analysis
um this section actually remains as
planned in the represent stage as the
chart strongly support it. So I will go
over briefly um because I've already
gone over it. Hurting the price and
volume charts are a textbook picture of
hurting behavior which is digitally
accelerated by social media. Um the
limits arbitrage is the key rational
expl explanation for why mispricing
wasn't fixed. EMH assumes rational
investors can short an overvalued stock
but here shorting was impossible due to
the infinite risk. The short squeeze
mechanic created infinite loss potential
and micro structure failure. Brokers
like Robin Hood halted buying a physical
limit to market function that prevented
price discovery.
So rational investor probability this
also remained as planned in the
represent stage. Um could irrational
investor have systematically profited?
Um so this was not a high profitability
trade. It was a high-risisk gamble on
the behavior of a crowd. Um
you're not betting on the fundamentals.
You're betting on what you think other
people will do. And therefore, while
massive profits were made, they were not
the kind of systematic risk adjusted
returns that EMH defines. It was a
one-off behavioral anomaly basically.
So, some future improvements that I
think could help. Um, the current
analysis is strong, but could be evolved
for a more rigorous if you were writing
like a graduate level paper.
Um
so I would conduct a um formal event
study. I would define event windows
around key dates and calculate the
cumulative abnormal returns for GameStop
against the benchmark and this would
statistically prove the magnitude of the
semi strong form viol violation. I would
also incorporate short interest data. My
current analysis relies on the stated
fact of 140% short interest. A better
implementation would find a historical
data set of GameStop short interest and
plot it directly against the price to
show the relationship visually.
A more adv advanced analysis would use
natural language processing tools to
scrape the Wall Street Bets campaign and
quantify investor sentiment hurting and
overconfidence and then test if that
sentiment was the leading factor of
price. further violating the weak semi-
strong EMH.
So, just some key learnings I've learned
um on the GameStop FE as a whole, the
GameStop short squeeze is a perfect
limit case for the efficient market
hypothesis. It demonstrates that while
markets might be mostly efficient most
of the time, the assumptions of EMH
can and do break down spectacularly.
Um EMH versus behavioral. The event
shows that EMH and behavioral finance
are not mutually exclusive. The market
was rational in one sense
but irrational in another. And the
behavioral framework is essential for
explaining the cause of the anomaly
while the limits to arbitrage framework
explains why it wasn't corrected.
On the driver process as a whole, um the
framework was crucial in this case
study. The define the discover stage
immediately caught a major factual error
in the prompt and without the first step
the entire analysis's starting point
would have been wrong. The driver
sequence ensured that I plan my analysis
before coding and then use the code's
output to validate my plan which is
exactly how like real world quantitative
analysis should work. So that is session
eight.

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Will Borowski and today we're going to be talking about my session 8 assignment, a market efficiency investigation of the GameStop short squeeze using the DRIVER framework. Before I write any code, I'm going to follow Dr. Zang's advice and start with the D in DRIVER, which is Define and Discover. This is my debrief for the project.
First, the objective. The goal is to analyze the GameStop event from 2021. I need to determine if the Efficient Market Hypothesis or EMH failed, and if it did, can behavioral finance explain what happened. Second, the scope. I'm analyzing GME stock price and volume. My time frame is August 2020 to June 2021 to capture the period before, during, and after the main squeeze. My benchmark for comparison will be the S&P 500. Third, the constraints. The main constraint I have is data. I'm using publicly available data from Yahoo Finance. I don't have access to private hedge fund data or a full feed of all Reddit comments, so my analysis is based on public price and volume. Fourth, my data inventory. I have GME and SPY historical price data. I need to verify the data in the assignment prompt itself. The assignment tells me that the analyst fundamentals were around $10 to $40 per share, which I will accept as a key piece of public information. Fifth, my success metric. Success isn't about beating the market. It's about making a clear and evidence-based conclusion. Can I identify which forms of the market were violated and which specific behavioral biases were at play? And finally, the benchmark. As I said, I'll be using the S&P 500 or the SPY. This will be my sanity check to see if the GME event was a unique, company-specific event or part of a market-wide trend. With that debrief out of the way, now we go to R, which is Represent. This is the simple logical flow that I'll follow. Step one, get the data for GME and our benchmark, the SPY. Step two, the assignment has a critical first step: Verify the claim that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020. My first analysis will be to check this fact. Step three, I'll create my main piece of evidence, which will be Plot One. This will show GME's price versus the S&P 500, so we can see visually the moment it detached from rational market behavior. Step four, I'll create Plot Two, showing GME's price on the same chart as its trading volume. This will show if the price spike was backed by a massive increase in trading, which can show herding. And then step five, I'll use these two plots to answer the core assignment questions. Next, we go down to the I part of the DRIVER framework, which is Implement. I'm going to walk through my Python code, which follows the plan I just laid out. First, I import my libraries: yfinance for getting the data, pandas for handling it, and matplotlib for making my plots. Then I set my variables. The tickers are GME and SPY, and the start and end dates are set from August 2020 to June 2021. This line, yf.download, is what pulls data from Yahoo Finance. This next step is part of my validation. The assignment told me to check if GME traded at 4 cents, so I wrote code to find the minimum price in August of 2020. The results are in: the prompt claimed 4 cents, but the actual low price was around $4 to $5. The prompt's data was wrong. This is a critical finding; it confirms that we can't trust data unless we verify it ourselves. Next, to make Plot One, I have to normalize the data. This is a very simple trick that just sets the starting price from both GME and SPY to 100. It lets us fairly compare their performances. Here's Plot One. The blue line is essentially tracking the S&P 500, which is basically the market. It's pretty stable. The red line is GameStop. You can see it tracks the market normally and then in January of 2021, it detaches completely from reality and spikes. Now, for Plot Two. This chart has two y-axes. The red line is the GME price and the blue bars are the trading volume. This plot is just as clear. The price spiked in January. The trading volume went from almost nothing to a massive unprecedented spike. This visual confirms that the price was driven by a frenzy of trading. Next, we go to V, which is Validation. As Dr. Zang's email said, first outputs are not sacred. So, for validation, I need to do my sanity check on the results. My first validation was the most important: I checked the prompt's data point and found it was false. The 4 cent claim was wrong. This already tells me the market for information might be inefficient. My benchmark comparison, Plot One, validates my analysis. The S&P 500 did not spike. This proves the GME event was not a rational market-wide response to new economic information. It was an event specific only to GME. For a third validation, the volume plot, Plot Two, shows that the price spike and volume spike line up perfectly. This validates the theory that the event was driven by a surge of trading activity, which supports the herding hypothesis. Next, we're going to go down to E, which is Evolve. I'll run through a quick scenario. The assignment asks if a rational investor could have profited. Well, let's think about it. For Scenario One, Melvin Capital was a rational investor. They saw the public information that GME's fundamental value was $10 to $40 and they shorted the stock, betting that it would fall. But the irrational market, driven by herding, stayed irrational longer than the hedge fund could stay solvent. They were blown up. This shows the limits to arbitrage. For Scenario Two, what if a new rational investor saw the Reddit momentum and bought in? They could have made thousands, but when do they sell? At $483? Or do they hold on until it's $50? The risk was enormous. This wasn't investing based on fundamentals; it was pure speculation. So evolving the problem shows that the rational strategies on both sides were extremely high risk. The market link to fundamental value was completely broken. So finally, we're going to move on to Reflect, the final part of the DRIVER framework. What did I learn and what's the final answer? What I learned through all of this is that the GME event is a perfect example of how market efficiency can fail spectacularly. Next, did I violate the Efficient Market Hypothesis? Absolutely. It violated weak-form efficiency. The technical analysis of Reddit discussions and high short-interest data did predict a massive future price change. The past did predict the future. It violated semi-strong form efficiency. All public information, like analyst reports saying the stock was worth $10 to $40, was completely ignored. The price did not reflect all public information. And then what explains that? This is a textbook case of behavioral finance. We saw herding. The volume plot shows everyone rushing in at the same time, driven by Reddit. We saw overconfidence. Retail traders believing they could beat the hedge funds. And we saw limits of arbitrage. The rational investors couldn't fix the mispricing because the irrational side had too much momentum and capital. My final reflection is that EMH is probably a good baseline for most stocks, most of the time. But this case proves that under the right conditions, behavioral finance factors can and do take over, creating massive bubbles that are detached from the fundamental values learned from the EMH model. This concludes my DRIVER framework analysis of the GameStop event. Thank you.",,0,1

Silas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 8 seconds
Hello, my name is Saz Bowman and we'll be going over session 8. So the objective of this analysis is to investigate the 2020-2021 GameStop short squeeze. So the core question was whether the GME event represents A fundamental failure of the efficient market hypothesis or if it can be explained.
Silas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 28 seconds
Over can be explained as a rational, albeit extreme market correction. This is my define discover represent an implementation plan stage. So the hypothesis tested reform so the GME event did not violate.
Silas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 44 seconds
Uh.
Silas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 46 seconds
Violate weak form efficiency. This will be difficult test without technical analysis and then the strong form. The GME event violated the semi strong efficiency. We will hypothesize prices did not instantly and rationally reflect publicly available information.
Silas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 2 seconds
But instead reacted with significant delayed in irrational surge and then H3 with the behavioral price action is better explained behavioral finance concepts then then by the EMH so.
Silas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 17 seconds
Next, so the the the data sources, so the price volume and data historically.
Silas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 24 seconds
Shown here the for GME in the market benchmark. So taking that from Yahoo Finance via the Python library and showing that through 2020 to 2021 as you can see here with the data validation saying the assignment prompt obviously requires verification of the same in GameStop traded.
Silas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 44 seconds
At .04 in August 2020, showcasing that, but the finding was that the it's factually incorrect and verified the historical data from Yahoo Finance shows that the split adjusted low for GME in August 2020 was 104 then and the analysis will proceed using that verified figure.
Silas Cameron Bowman 2 minutes 2 seconds
So claims to be tested, the retail trading volume increased tenfold. Those be tested by calculating the ratio of peak squeeze volume to prevent average claim to analyst fundamental value estimated 10 to 40 per share. Those be taken a given a baseline for fundamental value. So the representation.
Silas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 57 seconds
Yeah.
Silas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes
Yeah, so then the scripty stats lingress.
Silas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 6 seconds
Showcase the technical information of CPM using the Scripty stats lingress to run a full regression on GME's returns against S&P 500. So this single line calculates the beta. I'll show you that.
Silas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 21 seconds
So from the skippy up here and then it brings it down stage 3 and runs it here so calculates that so.
Silas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 33 seconds
This this calculates the beta and most probably the alpha the intercept and then testing that on the tenfold claiming by dividing the the peak squeeze volume by the pre-squeeze average. This gives us our empirical volume multiplier. So showcasing the where's my.
Silas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 50 seconds
The assuming risk going in and calculating the abnormal returns based on the CAPM, the volume analysis testing the tenfold like I just said and then risk addressed return showcasing the Sharpe ratio on that and then with the stage 4 showcasing the output, So what it's gonna output.
Silas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 7 seconds
Which I'll just go over later and then plotting abnormal returns on the visualization of the graft, the graph I should say. So now showcasing this code, so what it put out here.
Silas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 22 seconds
So this code executed validated our hypotheses with three key findings. First, the volume multiplier was 18.3.
Silas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 30 seconds
As you can see down here 18.3 and the prompts tenfold claim wasn't just correct, it was an understatement. This confirms the hurting of the hypothesis and 2nd the CAPM beta was -1.
Silas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 46 seconds
-1.9 around -1.98 In this powerful anomaly, a beta of one means moving with the market. So a beta of -2 means moving against the market with double the volatility. This is empirical proof that GME completely decoupled from marketing fundamentals.
Silas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 3 seconds
And third, most importantly, the daily alpha was 4.3% so.
Silas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 10 seconds
Right here, daily alpha 4.3 in an efficient market, the alpha should be 0. Finding a daily abnormal return of over 4% statistically significant and persistent is a smoking gun quote UN quote that that massive predictably profits were predictably.
Silas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 28 seconds
Profits were possible. So this is a definitive definitive violation of the semi strong form EMH and then when we go down into the the actual graph here. So this chart generated by the code visualizes the inefficiency. So you're looking at the daily abnormal returns.
Silas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 47 seconds
The alpha as you can see in the late in late 2020.
Silas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 53 seconds
This the bars are small and centered, so as you can see here, just centered around zero and just as EMH would predict. Then in January 2021, the mod shows a massive multi-standard deviation spike in the alpha and this directly addresses your feedback to see the visualization.
Silas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 13 seconds
So this strengthens the analysis and clearly shows the moment market efficiency failed, as you can see here with this massive spike. Um.
Silas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 23 seconds
So which form of efficiency was violated? The semi-strong form was definitely violated. So public information like 140% short interest was available for months, but the market failed to price it in.
Silas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 39 seconds
The price only moved after a social media catalyst hurting, not not when the information became public. This event is a perfect example of limits to arbitrage. Rational search sellers were right. The stock was overvalued, but they were forced to liquidate from margin calls before the price corrected, and in fact their liquidations drove the price even higher.
Silas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 57 seconds
My final reflection in this is GME event shows that the financial theory in real-world markets can be two different things. So a rational investor as defined by the EMH would have shortened GME based on its fundamentals. However, a rational short seller in the world.
Silas Cameron Bowman 9 minutes 13 seconds
Went bankrupt. So the market anomaly persisted longer than the short sellers could remain solvent. And this is the limits to arbitrage arbitrage concept in action. So the market was inefficient, but the inefficiency couldn't be corrected by rational actors.
Silas Cameron Bowman 9 minutes 30 seconds
Because the risk of return was too high. Overall, this assignment taught me that while the data-driven analysis grounded through like CAPM is our best tool, we must also account for behavioral factors in the market structure because this code proves hurting and short squeezes can temporarily overwhelm any model or efficiency.
Silas Cameron Bowman 9 minutes 48 seconds
Um.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, Dr. Zang. This is my session 8 assignment. Um, in this analysis, I'll be investigating market efficiency through the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021. Uh, my goal is to test how the event aligns with the with or challenges the efficient mic market hypothesis. Um specifically I want to determine which form of EMH um weak semi semi- strong or strong appears to be violated whether rational investors could could have systematically profited in real time and how behavioral forces uh and limits to arbitrage may explain what happened. My hypothesis are as follows. So under the weak form um past prices should not yield uh ab abnormal returns. Under the semi- strong form all publicly available information should be immediately um and correctly incorporated into prices. And then under the strong form even investors with private or insider information um should not consistently earn superior riskadjusted returns. Uh to test these I'll focus on three critical windows. Ryan Cohen's 13D filling on August 28th, 2020, the January 2021 runup from the 11th to the 29th, and the trading restrictions that occurred on January 28th and 29th. So that is my discover phase. So for represent, so to represent my analytical plan here, as you can see on my Python code, I use a market model comparing GameStop to the S&P 500 proxy from June 1st, 2020 through March 15, 2021. The estimation window from June to mid December captures normal market behaviors before the major surge. Uh and then using Yahoo Finance data, I measured abnormal returns um and computed cumulative abnormal returns um with within each event window. I also calculated volume Zcores um to detect significant deviations in trading activity relative to normal field relative to normal levels. Apologies. Um the main objective was to see whether the market reactions were immediate and rational or delayed in an and extreme in ways inconsistent with efficient pricing. So these outputs um that you'll see in a bit allow me to evaluate price price efficiency, behavioral in influences and whether any trading strategy could have produced reliable profits um once real world trading frictions are considered. So for the implement stage um in the implement in the implementation phase I began by downloading the adjusted GameStop and S&P data from Yahoo Finance using um what's it called? using uh Python's Y finance library. Um and then after flattening potential multi-index structures, I extracted closing prices and volumes, closing prices and volumes aligned with the data sets by date and calculated daily log returns. I use an OS regression to um to estimate the market model coefficients where GME's returns were regressed on uh the S&P returns. GameStop's returns were regressed on the S&P returns. Um and then during the estim estimation window yielding estimates for alpha and beta using those parameters. Uh I calculated daily abnormal returns. Create a new column for zcores to highlight period of unusually high trading activity. And then finally, I summarized the results across three event windows, producing statistics such as sample size, mean abnormal returns, t values, p values, and cumulative abnormal returns. These figures quantify how extreme GameStop's movements were uh relative to normal market expectations. So as you can see here um doing the daily returns and then the the market model based on the estimation window the zcores here and then um the functions to compute the window stats here there's some plots that I'll show you in a little bit and then here's whether or not you know abnormal returns are present and and the zcores as well. Um so to validate the model um and interpret the results I examined both summary statistics and plotted outputs the price chart which as you can see let's see um the price chart which is right over here um showed an extraordinary rise during January uh 2021. one

as you can see here um with GameStop reaching an intraday high near $483 um and then followed by a rapid uh crash and then abnormal returns clustered heavily during the runup with multiple with multiple statistically significant positive days. the cumulative abnormal return uh chart which is here um confirmed this momentum pattern returns didn't simply reflect new information but appeared to snowball um as attention increased and then volume Z scores spiked dramatically during the same period reaching many standard deviations um above the baseline signaling an unpred unprecedented retail trading influx Um and then the uh t tests um showed strong g deviations from zero uh abnormal returns in certain windows. Um

as you can see here and uh particularly in the runup this suggests that price cannot be fully explained by new information or fundamentals alone. So these results indicate tension with weak form um EMH as past momentum and investor attention created abnormal movements beyond what rational models would predict. So in the evolved stage I considered how these results might change investor or policymaker behavior. Even though the data showed large abnormal returns, these opportunities were not realistically exploitable by rational investors due to significant real world frictions, trading halts, um wide bid ask spreads, short sale restrictions, clearing house margin calls, uh and retail broker limitations such as those on Robin Hood made it nearly impossible to systematically profit from the mispricing. So therefore while the price patterns uh violate simple statistic statistical efficiency the broader market remain constrained by micro structure and operational realities. Um so for investors this suggests that chasing momentum during extreme attention-driven events is more likely to result in losses than sustainable gains. Um and for regulators the event highlighted weaknesses in settlement and liquidity systems. This motivated later change as the move towards um the as the move towards T+1 settlement um to reduce clearing risks. And then for reflect reflecting on the results, um my findings suggest that weak form EMH face significant strain during the GameStop episode. Um as strong momentum and clustered abnormal returns challenge the idea that past information is useless for prediction for p for predicting future returns. However, these patterns uh likely weren't exploitable once friction um and execution risk were considered. So the semi-rong form was also challenged since public information such as the 13D filing and the announcement of trading restrictions led to overreactions and delayed corrections rather than immediate accurate price incorporation. Um yet prices did um adjust quickly when restrictions were implemented showing that markets still process public data rapidly even if it's um imperfect. The strong form um meanwhile held firm no group um so not even in institutional investors consistently profited on a riskadjusted basis. In fact, hedge funds like Melvin Capital um sustained massive losses. um behavioral explanations such as hurting, overconfidence, attention cascades from um from websites like like Reddit and and Wall Street Bets and limits to the arbitrage best describe the episode's magnitude and persistence.

Um so in conclusion, uh the GME the GameStop case shows that market efficiency is not binary, um but it's conditional. Um, while price movements clearly deviated from what rational models predict, the inability of most participants to exploit those deviations support the notion that markets remain broadly efficient once behavioral dynamics and frictions are recognized. Um, so weak form EMH was stressed, semi- strong EMH was strained uh under extreme social and liquidity pressure. Um, and but strong EMH ultimately survived. So behavioral finance um and structural constraints rather than irrational irrationality alone offer the most convincing offer the most convincing explanation of why GameStop behaved as it did. This GameStop um story reminds us that even in datadriven market, psychology and infrastructure can moment uh momentarily overpower efficiency, but rarely in a way that um rational investors can pro uh profit profitably anticipate. So that's my analysis for the GameStop. Um but yeah, thank you for listening.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Ella Brummet and today
I'm going to be walking you through my
session 8 assignment. So, let's go ahead
and let's get started.
So, um throughout this assignment, I'm
going to be using the driver framework
to um talk about this case study and
what I found. Um and yeah, so let's go
ahead and let's dive into this. So um
essentially for my Dstage or the define
and discover stage um I just kind of um
analyze the information that was given
to me. So um for example um the
information given was that the GameStop
stocks traded at 4 cents in August of
2020 and after some research I
determined this to be incorrect data. So
the GME stock price in August of 2020
ranged between a low of approximately
1.04
or $14
and a high of approximately $167.
So basically this confirms that the um 4
cent claim is inaccurate by a factor of
over 25 times wrong. So, this is really
important when going in to some of the
other information that was provided.
Um, like for example, in August 2020,
they were like pretty low, like near
bankruptcy. Yes. Because it was like
again between just a dollar, like stock
price when Moch was like a stable market
price be four and $5. Um, and then it
also said like in September 2020, Ryan
Cohen buys a 13% stake. So then the
price is going to increase a little bit.
Um, the January of 2021. This is also a
really important factor because this is
like the whole Reddit um driven surge
where like the price is spiking, the
stock price is like insanely high
because there was like rumors that it
was going to be really high. So people
are willing to invest which kind of
caused it all just to go crazy and
inflate a little bit. And then um and
then 2022 to 2024 uh we are back in the
postevent stabilization. So the stock
price is kind of normal out and it's
evened out to its normal
um to a normal stock price range for a
pretty well-known company. So for the
represent stage or the R stage um we're
going to talk about the EHM form. So
this is basically three categories. So
it's like weak, semi- strong or strong.
So basically our weak past prices can't
predict future returns. So essentially
we can't base any of our analysis off of
it because it's just it's a weak um
form. So semi- strong is that the prices
reflect public information. So like if
there is a rumor that um GameStop price
is going to increase and so people want
to get in on it so then they can make a
little bit more money on the return. And
then the strong would be prices reflect
all information. So this would be public
and private. Um which is essentially
just the opposite of weak.
basically the prices are going to like
um be able to determine like if everyone
knows about what's going to happen and
all of that. So next is the behavioral
biases to examine. So um there's like
hurting behavior which is really
important um to make sure we're
examining throughout this uh driver
stage um overconfidence and confirmation
bias. um some FOMO, the fear of missing
out um and maybe missing out on a great
price or a great return from the stock.
So there's that and then there's limits
to arbit arbitrage.
So we're moving in now to the implement
stage. So the implement Oh wait, I'm
sorry. No, we're not. We're still in the
um represent. So now I'm going to talk
about the formulas that I used um for
the financial model in analyzing um this
case study. So first with the financial
models and formulas, the first one I
used was the capin model which shows the
expected return on estimation. So this
is really important because it kind of
talks about like the expected return and
then like it goes into like our
risk-free rate, our market return and
then the systematic risk that the
company has. So basically, it's a
baseline of what returns should have
been back in 2020 when the stock price
was ranging in August at like $167
um per share. So the second one was
abnormal return and cumulative abnormal
return. So the abnormal return or AR uh
measures deviations between the actual
and expected. So essentially when we
calculate this we needed to make sure um
like just because um a return is
expected to be high doesn't mean that it
actually is. So it was really important
to analyze what people were actually
getting um in return. Then we have the
cumulative abnormal return which is
C and basically this is just across the
event window. So they basically indicate
that new information was not immediately
incorporated to prices. So like in this
case it was like the Reddit information
which is suggests that this company has
a semi strong uh EMH validation which is
important to note. Um, and then there's
also the market model, which this was
interesting to me because I hadn't
really heard of it um before like this
chapter. And this was just an
alternative to the CAPM um like formula.
So basically, it's just um a different
way to
um do the risk-free rate like if it
can't be determined or estimated. So um
I thought that was really important to
know. And then there's also the weak
form I efficiency. Um and this was about
the Durban and Watson information that
was given. So basically um the test like
if the past returns predict our future
return. So basically we're winning this.
This is from the weak form efficiency
because weak is based on our past.
Um and then it kind of goes into the
Durban Watson statistic which again I
not really heard of this before this
chapter. Um and um basically it's a
simplified test for autocorrelation. So
basically it's saying if it's two
there's no auto correlation and it's
going to support efficiency which is
really good. And then if it's less than
two it's a positive um autocorrelation.
So basically there's going to be
momentum or predictability for the
company. So my implement stage um is in
collab
which should be able to pull up really
quick. is basically what it was doing
was just talking about like the Python
um code and um using like different
financial sites is what I did to kind of
um walk through these calculations
um which was really helpful and I know I
just walked through them um like
explaining what they were but basically
what my code did here was it analyzed um
the actual code and um plugged in some
numbers to see our return rate and all
that which is super great and super
helpful.
Okay, next is our validate stage. So
basically what I did was I checked the
analysis um
like valid validity.
So um basically I did the data sources
which were Yahoo Finance verified and
then my stat statistical results are um
reproducible in Python. So basically I
was just talking about my code is
already in there. So basically I can
just run it again and that would be how
that would work. I'm also cross-checked
the event timing versus news reports
which was done also in the Python code
just to make sure that like our
information is correct and then abnormal
returns are um statistically significant
because this would support our in um
inefficiency
claim. So this was really important
because I think it was like making sure
that we knew that the stock price was
not actually 4 cents um played a really
big role into making sure we had these
correct information and the correct
calculations.
So then our next step in the evolve um
basically this was just kind of some
other things that we could do that might
help us better understand. So this is
like market efficiency doing a binary
binary test um information pro
processing rapid or rational um a
profitability which I thought this was
interesting and then behavioral finance
and then an analysis approach. So more
financial models, integrated financial
behavioral primary driver, like all of
these things I think could maybe make um
our um case a little bit stronger if I
like
if you like were to dive a little bit
deeper into it. And then la um the next
stage, the last stage um we're going to
be reflecting. So I didn't really I
didn't really know a lot about the EMH
limitations. So the real markets that um
deviate during high attention events and
social media implications. So I didn't
really understand that there was like a
really strong or like a really weak um I
just kind of thought like it just kind
of just fluctuated with the market. Um
and I didn't really know there was like
a specific category for those things. Um
also um I learned that the behavioral
finance actually explains like our
GameStop stock better. um and which is
really interesting. Also, there's
investor implications. So, these
short-term inefficiencies exist, but
they're not systematically exploitable,
which I think that was also super
something that was important to note for
me. And then lastly, the policy um
implications. So, highlights the need
for the market circuit breakers and
transparency
and trading restrictions. So, um I
learned a lot from this assignment. I
learned so many new formulas that I
definitely think I'm going to be able to
implement. And so my other financial
classes that I have to take um and
getting a better understanding of this
like case study um instead of just doing
like an assignment, I think it was a
really great way to dive deeper into the
finance world. So thank you so much",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"is my session 8 assignment for manual 310. In this video, I'm going to walk through my driver analysis of the GameStop short squeeze using my Python notebook as the main visual. Starting with the defined part of driver, u the decision goal for this project is to figure out whether the GameStop or GME short squeeze in 2020 through 2021 was just crazy but still still consistent with market efficiency or whether it actually looked like a violation of the efficient market hypothesis hypothesis. Um the core question is did the GME short squeeze provide evidence against the weak, semi-strong or strong forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The scope of the analysis is the time window from August 2020 through February 2021 with a little extension into April. For context, um I focused on daily prices, returns, and volumes plus a few major public events. For risk adjusted performance, I compare GME to the S&P 500 using CAPM. And my success metric is whether I can measure abnormal returns and and cumulative abnormal returns in a clean way. Use those to say something meaningful about weak, semi- strong and uh strong EMH and correctly fact check the specific claim that the GME traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. Um in the discover section, I laid out what data and facts I need. um historical prices and and volumes for GME and the S&P 500 from Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, a timeline of events uh which is Cohen joining the board, the January price spike and the Robin trading restrictions and then u basic inputs for CIPM, a reasonable beta range, a tiny risk-free rate and using S&P 500 as the market for portfolio. Um I also flag three EMH forms the weak form which is which addresses you know do pass Prices and returns help exp happen semi- strong. Do prices react efficiently to public news or Reddit post or in the strong form? Would you have needed insider style information to consistently profit? And I finally reminded myself to think about behavioral biases like hurting, FOMO, overconfidence, and limited arbit arbitrage. Um because uh those are all all over the G story. Moving on to the represent section. Um I designed the structure. This is where I I designed the structure of the analysis. Um first I built an event study timeline with four different windows. Um a pre-event window from August to December uh 2020 to establish normal returns quote unquote normal returns and volatility. Um a normal buildup window in early January 2021 when retail interest and short interest awareness started to ramp up. And then the main event window roughly late January to early February, early February where when we see the actual spike and a postevent window where the price comes back down and the market tries to re re-equilibrate. Then I map that onto an EMH testing framework. Um, for week forum EMH, I'm mainly looking at how extreme the returns and volatility get and whether anything in the past data would have obviously predicted this. For the semi- strong form, um, I focus on abnormal returns around specific public events, Cohen's board announcement, the peak squeeze day, and the trading restriction day. Um, for strong form EMH, I I ask whether it looks like only a small privileged group could systematically profit or whether a lot a lot of retail traders are able to ride the wave. Um, next I lay the financial modeling modeling approach um where I compute daily returns for GME and the S S&P 500. I use the capm to an estimate gi expected return on each day and then I compute abnormal returns as actual minus expected and uh c as the cumulative sum events. I also sketch the visualization plan um four key charts that I'll point I'll point to later. The uh GE price versus market price over time, GM trading volume and millions of shares. a scatter of Gme versus market daily returns with the um CAPM regression line uh car curves around Curves around the three key events. And finally, I uh wrote out the hypothesis down here. Um H subzero is um no systematic abnormal returns and H sub one is significant AR and C that don't line up with EMH and instead look behavioral. So that is the R part of the driver method. Moving on to implement. Um down here you can see all of my code. We have the setup and then the question one. I'm running it here to see the output. All of it is in one script. Um and this is the output down here. Um so I start by importing um a variety of things. You can see up here that includes numpy, pandas, y finance, mapplot, lib and uh stats models. And then I downloaded the uh daily data for GME and the SP500 from July 2020 to April 2021. Um for question one, I filter the GME data down to August 2020 and compute um down here can some puts um I compute the number of trading days in August which is uh 21. The first trading day price which is about a dollar4 the last day trading the last trading day price was about $167. Uh minimum adjusted close in the month was uh one $14 and the maximum was 167 and average was about 120. Then I explicitly checked whether the price ever hit 4 cents and whether it fell ever fell below $1 in August. Both answers are no. So the conclusion is, you know, the statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is not supported by the data. It was trading around $1, not pennies. Um, going down to the price table here, I also show a sample of daily prices. Um, so here I can I can point out specific rows like August 3rd through August 14th and visually reinforce that the prices are just are all just over a dollar. Um, and this is like the first part of the implement section. Going up to what I did for what I called question two. Here I align GE and S&P prices and compute simple daily returns for each. Um, moving down here to the output. Um, here you can see the returns of the see the returns DF data frame with two columns. um GM return and then market return. Then I calculate some basic summary statistics uh which is here. Uh the number of trading days is 208. GM's average daily return is about 3.2% while the market uh the markets is about 0.15%. Um GM's volatility is about.188 versus 010 for the market. So GM is roughly 19 times more volatile. uh the correlation between GME and the market is around negative.10 basically uncorrelated uh but next is kind of some of the key visuals for this part uh this chart this chart shows the normalized price math where both GME and the market start at 1.0 in mid 2020. Um you can see that for months that for months GME moves slowly then suddenly in January 2021 it explodes upward to almost 80 times its starting level while the market the market line barely moves. Um that's our first visual here. Uh that's our first visual evidence that GM's behavior is wildly disconnected from ordinary market moves. Uh going down to the volume chart, we have uh GM trading volume in millions of shares. Again, for most of the pre-event period, volume is relatively modest. Um then we see huge spikes around the squeeze, hundreds of millions of shares in a single day. Um so these two plots together kind of show that a dramatic price decoupling show a dramatic price decoupling from the market in extreme trading activity consistent with speculative behavior and um hurting. And that sets up a CAPM test for question three, which going up to the code for what I call question three. Um, I run a simple CAPM uh regression where the dependent variable Y is Jimmy's daily return and the independent variable X is the market's daily return with a constant for the intercept. Um going down to the output for question three uh the results are alpha is 0.0349 or 3.49% per day with a t stat of about 2.65 which is statistically significant. Um the beta is.19231 with a t stat of.147 which is not stat statistically significant at the 5% level. Um r squared is 0.0104 014 meaning the markets explains only about 1% of Jaime's day-to-day variation. Based on that I I can compute that CIPM predicted returns and abnormal returns um which is here you can see that for each state I have the actual G return the market return the predicted CAPM return and the abnormal component which is the residual. But going down to the scatter plot, this actually shows the the GME daily returns versus market daily returns with the red CPM regression line on top. The key visual insight here is the huge vert spread around the red line. Even when the market return is close to zero, Gme's return can be anywhere from big negatives to huge positives. So the interpretation is uh capm produces a small r squar a weird negative beta and a large positive alpha. That means traditional market risk is not doing a good job of explaining gam most of the action is idiosyncratic and abnormal. Um but these those abnormal returns feed directly into kind of the part the event study I did in question four. Um going up to my code for question four. Um, I use those abnormal returns to build an event study in this in this part of the code. So, I defined three main events. Um, Cohen joins the board January 11th, 2021. Peak squeeze day, which is January 27th in 2021. Um, Robin Hood training restrictions, which is January 28th of 2021. Um around each of these dates I take a plus minus 20 day window and then I compute the cumul cumulative abnormal return or c by summing up the abnormal returns in that window going down to my output. Um this figure sorry this figure here shows the three C curves on the same plot with vertical dash lines in at the event dates. So after Cohen's announcement on 111 car starts the C starts drifting upward which suggests the market is reacting positively to that news beyond what CAPM would predict. Um going into that 127 127 the peak squeeze uh C spikes sharply upward showing big positive abnormal performance not explained by the market and then after 128 trading restrictions sorry after 128 trading restrictions um after the 128 trading restrictions C begins to fall which aligns with price prices dropping once the platforms u limited buying. So the C curves behave exactly how we would expect if these events contain surprise information and if behavioral dynamics and trading constraints were driving prices rather than a smooth efficient incorporation of public data. Um so that is the implement section of my driver framework. Moving on to valid validate up here. Um, putting it all together, question one showed that the that viral 4 cent GME claim is just kind of false. The data itself is the first line of a defense for efficiency. Uh, question two or my code for question two showed that GME had massive average returns, 19 times the volatility of the market and almost no correlation with the index uh with price and volume completely decoupled from normal market behavior. Question three showed a small R squar significant positive alpha and a strange non-significant beta meaning capm does not explain GM's returns and then question four showed that C around key events is a is large and structured not random noise. So from an EMH standpoint weak form EMH doesn't look great here. There's that kind of classic momentum and reversal behavior that is that a purely random walk wouldn't predict. Semi-rong EMH uh is most is most challenged. Uh publicly visible events and Reddit coordination produce substantial abnormal returns, not just tiny blips. Strong form EMH is always a stretch in practice, and this episode um doesn't rescue it. There's no sign that only Insight has profited. Retail traders also rode the wave, at least if they timed it right. Um but that's my validate section. Moving on to evolve. If I had more time to evolve this project, I'd focus on four different things. um richer risk models. Uh swap swap that single factor C capm for a FMA French or momentum model and see if GM's abnormal returns stay larger after controlling for size value and momentum factors which is something I um learned when I did some more research on this um topic. Um, I would use better benchmarks. Compare that GME to a retail ETF or a meme stock basket like AMC and BlackBerry to see if GME is unique or just the craziest member of a broader phenomenon. I could look at intraday and liquid liquidity data, pull uh intraday quotes to study bid ask spreads, order flow and liquidity drying up um around the peak. could also look at sentiment and flows. Inte integrate the Reddit, Google, Reddit and Google Trends options options volume um and short interest to formally connect narrative and positioning to abnormal returns. Um I'd also tighten the communication by turning this notebook into a short executive level slide deck with just the four key charts and a oneep one page summary. Um but that's something I would do in maybe an internship or a job which is just something I've been thinking about lately. Uh but that's uh the evolve section. Moving on to the last section. Um on the finance side, this project made EMH and CAPM feel much less like textbook acronyms and much more like tools with limits. Um seeing that tiny R squared and weird data in a real data set drove home that models are approximations. They work in in quiet markets but can break down an interesting retail driven episodes which is something that I've thought about lately, especially in finance and and in some of my other classes as well. Um, on the analytic side, I got more comfortable using Python from end to end, pulling data, cleaning it, um, engineering returns, running regressions, computing say, and building visuals that actually tell a story. It's something because I'm a BAME student, it's something I do pretty often. So, um, but this has made me feel a lot more comfortable doing it specifically in finance. Um, debugging the notebook, which I had to do a handful of times, forced me to con constantly do sanity check, sanity check my shapes, indices, and assumptions. Um, On market behavior, the GME story, at least through this lens, looks less like a prices are always right and more like a combination of coordination, constraints, and narratives pushing prices around. Public information matters, but the way people process and act on that information can create huge temporary deviations from what a model like CAPM would call fair value. Um, so going forward, it's a very fascinating structure um to look at the situation that happened in 2021, 2021 with the G stock price. But that is my session 8 assignment.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, this is Isaac Bushy and this is my session 8 uh assignment for management 310. So jumping into it, we want to define what we're what we're here doing. So our first critical step here is to verify the statement that GameStop traded at four since the shared in August of 2020 um against actual historical data. If incorrect, document the accurate figures and determine the appropriate comm communication approach for correcting the professor. So this shows us our little event timeline here of um what's going on in the market during that time. Gives us some key data points and some of our required analysis here. So the first thing that I immediately jumped into was was figuring out if this statement was correct. So over here I'm in Google Finance and if we go to it was August of 2021 or 2020 I believe. Yes, August of 2020. There's August 7th, 2020. It's sharing at approximately a$14. So a whole dollar above what the claim is in um in this statement here. So, um, so this this originally this right away is wrong. Um, and then we're going to want to move in to looking at this spike that they're talking about. So, if we look this up, the this right here, this spike that they're talking about here is something I've written into my code here for my um implement session. This spike is shown right here with within GameStop's trading value. This is that time. This is around January of 2021. And the price rocketed because of because of information from that time. So it was a big thing. Um it completely changed this the trading price is it rocketed and then plummeted again later. So overall my initial statement here is that as part of the initial um validation step all price data was sourced um through um Google finance and while the prompt noted that it was four it's trading at 4 cents a share in August 2021 the verified split was at a around $14 as we saw when we looked at it at August 7th. So, this analysis proceeded using the verification um with those data which the the peak price being $483 pre-split on January 20, 2021. And this I did confirm um GameStop did peak out of at at close to $483 um during its time in January of 2021. So moving into our the project goal here, our present stage, we're trying to figure out um how we can represent this and how we can show this within a um within our code here. So this is what I created. Um this is what I continue to work on to find um our our EMH testing. So we use this code in Gemini just to understand just to code it through here just to understand what um give a kind of a visual on what we were looking at. So um and all these prices within this is is through public information. I found this all through Google um Google finance. So, as we move in down through this data, we kind of talked about it earlier. Um, so this graph just shows the adjusted price of of GameStop throughout um and then kind of its overall graph kind of similar to what this is here. And um it shows some peaks. This is our all-time peak up here of January 2021. And it just kind of shows the the ins and flows of the adjusted price down here. This is the graph that um I find extremely helpful. This is the graph that shows that that that shows that super high peak of um from the Reddit um price comparatively and then it sees if you go down here you can see your um how the stock price is super low comparatively um and then it rockets up and then it does settle back down completely. So it it completely shows the the massive spike and the mass and then the and then the um plummet. Um so it val it completely validates that that the $483 was correct. So um through this we learn a bunch about um about GameStop and how it's and its stock price traded. So we kind of go back into this required analysis and just to answer some of these questions. So we verified that all this data price and we we did that we figured out that that that the 4 cents was wrong and that the 483 did that that is accurate and it did come in. Um test which form of market efficiency weak semi- strong strong was violated. So we through this we find that the uh the weak form violation was violated. Um it claims that all past trading data is already reflected in the stock price making technical analysis use useless. So the the GameStop um trade clearly violates this. The entire uh Reddit subreddit um thesis was a form of technical m momentum and analysis arguing that the past price suppression and the high interest created a predictable future price and it just didn't. this the um the behavior was just not like that. It just was driven up and down completely. So the semi that that creates that the semi- strong form violation was clearly um violated as well. These semi- strong um claims that publicly available information, news, Reddit posts, things like that is instantly and accurately priced. Um this was um clearly violated through the high short interest the 140% float this says was public and that Ryan Cohan's um investment was public. So this um the market contractage was neither neither instant nor accurate. Instead of the price moving to a new rational fundamental data, it became completely detached from it driven by social sentiment. The price of $483 did not reflect GameStop's earnings potential. It reflected a market mania based on public information. And then moving could moving to the next question. Could rap could rational investors have profited systematically? Um the key word here being systematically and the risk adjusted um from GameStop here. So this would all just be this would all just be dependent on the investor. I think it would be extremely hard um for rational investors to have profited. It just they just have to know because it was so um in and out. Um so I think overall it would be extremely hard and then compare um efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior. So by doing this we look at the um the price versus the fundamental value. So prices are set by rational investors and reflect the asset's true worth and then the observed behavior being the price had no connection to fundamental value. The 483 it was driven entirely by um supply to NAM and like in the online and things like that that that was just going on during that time. Um it was not set by anything within it. Um so that's like one major thing the differences between these um um conclusions. So just some um wrap up some closure here. Clearly um these statements were wrong um or at least the the four cents was wrong and this investment strategy um was something um this this market efficiency investigation was something um very important and very interesting throughout because especially GameStop as a company um I reflect on that because GameStop as a company now is completely it's kind of going out in these like weird market like highs and then lows and then now it's like getting like super down comparatively. So like GameStop's just like if we go here, yeah, GameStop's just losing. It's negative down, down, down. And then like we go to the month, it's just it's just plummeting compared to like compared to like what we're looking at here when it rock when it skyrocketed up like even that's 5 years ago. So I think this was like this was a very interesting market analysis like how we can learn from this and um how we can go from this. But thank you. Uh this is Isaac Bushy and that's the end of my uh assignment.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"session 8 assignment. Um the goal here
0:03
is to look at the GameStop uh short
0:06
squeeze of 2020 and 2021
0:10
um and investigate the uh market
0:13
efficiency.
0:15
So before we even started
0:19
uh before I even start I have to go
0:21
through the define and discover stages.
0:23
Um, so I say that the GameStop price in
0:26
August of 2020, uh, August 1st it was a
0:30
dollar and August 31st it was a $167
0:33
which is an increase of 65.8%.
0:38
Um, we are, you know, defining the
0:42
GameStop short squeeze event and uh, the
0:45
target audience for this would be like
0:47
individual retail investors as a big one
0:50
through like Reddit and stuff. uh
0:53
financial analysts and uh researchers
0:57
and um regulatory bodies uh policy
1:00
makers
1:03
and financial media and educators. That
1:05
was a big one as well. I remember seeing
1:08
all this stuff on the news
1:10
uh about GameStops up, you know, x
1:12
amount of percent or whatever, x
1:14
dollars. Um
1:18
so yeah, so this is the event timeline.
1:22
um the key data points.
1:25
Um and yeah, so basically what I did is
1:29
I all of this code here is just
1:32
importing all of the
1:34
um historical data.
1:38
Uh there's a lot of it. Um but it just
1:41
takes all these dates here and it gives
1:43
you the price, the high, the low, the
1:44
volume, the open, the close
1:48
um of the the stock price. Um um so now
1:52
defining the EMH. So the MH is the
1:56
efficient market hypothesis uh which
1:58
essentially
2:00
states that the
2:04
uh it's a financial theory stating that
2:06
the the asset uh prices fully reflect
2:10
all available information
2:12
um making it impossible to consistently
2:16
uh beat the market so to speak uh and
2:19
achieve uh superior returns. So this
2:22
theory is is divided into like three
2:25
different forms weak, semi- strong and
2:28
strong.
2:30
Um each with a different each with
2:32
different assumptions.
2:34
So the weak form suggests that um
2:38
current prices reflect all historical
2:40
data in the market such as past you know
2:43
trading volumes uh past stock prices.
2:48
Um and according to this firm uh
2:50
technical analysis
2:53
uh which is essentially using past price
2:56
patterns to predict future movements is
2:59
useless um for generating abnormal
3:01
returns.
3:04
Um and
3:07
the uh semi- strong uh version form of
3:12
the EMH is uh a form that uh prices
3:16
reflect all publicly available
3:19
information including historical data,
3:22
financial statements, news,
3:24
uh economic reports.
3:28
Um
3:30
and then the fundamental analysis which
3:32
relies on public information
3:35
uh is therefore also considered
3:37
ineffective and consistently
3:40
outperforming the market. So, and then
3:44
there's finally the strong form which
3:46
the strongest form of the hypothetical
3:48
or the the hypothesis
3:51
um claims that price reflects all
3:54
information both public and private.
3:58
Um
4:00
so like insider information as well and
4:03
this implies that even uh with in
4:05
insider information uh or inside
4:08
information
4:10
uh it would be impossible to
4:11
consistently achieve superior returns as
4:13
prices would instantly adjust to reflect
4:16
it.
4:18
Uh so yeah that is the EMH defined. So
4:24
now moving on past that
4:27
um we have a couple graphs here that
4:31
show the daily returns of GameStop
4:34
um and then the auto uh correlated daily
4:36
returns and autocorrelation of uh volume
4:41
um
4:43
and
4:46
just more and more graphs. Here is the
4:50
um not this one the next one.
4:54
Uh a lot of historical information given
4:56
here. Here we go. So the uh daily and
5:01
cumulative abnormal returns for some key
5:04
events here
5:07
um are shown in these graphs. So daily
5:09
abnormal uh returns for Ryan Cohen's
5:12
initial stake and then cumulative
5:15
uh from August uh of 2020 to for two
5:20
months.
5:22
Uh here is for the board seat in
5:24
December of 2020. As you can see it's
5:28
going up over you know the days.
5:32
Um and then there's the short squeeze
5:34
for Reddit and the congressional hearing
5:37
in February and in March.
5:40
Uh so yeah, deficiency, behavioral
5:43
biases and anomalies.
5:46
So given these uh quantitative uh
5:49
findings on these major events here um
5:54
only two of them are statistically
5:57
significant which is the initial stake
5:59
in the board seat and these are not. Um
6:03
however
6:06
um
6:08
the behavioral link for the initial
6:11
stake um
6:15
this uh prolonged positive abnormal
6:18
return could be attributed to
6:20
underreaction or delayed reaction of
6:22
positive news.
6:25
Um
6:28
this potentially is forming an anchoring
6:30
position um where initial presses are
6:32
used as a reference point uh causing
6:35
slow adjustment to new information.
6:38
Um
6:40
the market efficiency implication of
6:42
this is that the uh it's it's suggest a
6:47
violation of semi- strong form market
6:49
efficiency which as stated before
6:53
um is right here. I already read it. I'm
6:57
not going to read it again. Um
7:02
the Reddit short squeeze 2021 January.
7:07
Um,
7:08
unfortunately I was not part of this.
7:12
Uh,
7:13
I had I had just started investing um a
7:17
year later actually. Um but regardless
7:22
um
7:26
definitely overconfidence
7:28
uh by the the investors um in a way at
7:32
least if you're looking from a a safe
7:33
standpoint obviously
7:36
everyone's dumping or pumping
7:39
you know short squeezing and and it got
7:43
kind of wild. Um
7:46
definitely hurting behavior. um you
7:48
know, everyone was getting together and
7:50
like, ""All right, we can screw over
7:51
these um you know, billionaires and and
7:55
uh hedge funds and stuff that are
7:57
betting against the market or against uh
7:59
GameStop.""
8:01
Um it was pretty rational. Nothing
8:04
really like to this scale has
8:08
it doesn't happen very often or ever. Um
8:11
the Yeah. And then the congressional
8:14
hearings
8:16
although not stat uh statistically
8:18
significant
8:20
um in terms of the p value the
8:25
um
8:27
semi- strong form because there's a lack
8:30
of statistical
8:32
significance
8:33
as stated.
8:35
Um
8:37
so yeah um overall semi- strong
8:44
um which is uh price reflects all
8:48
publicly available information uh
8:51
including historical data
8:53
uh news financial statements and
8:55
economic reports.
8:58
So uh yes
9:01
and then um these are the values taken
9:05
from all the historical data that I
9:07
showed above
9:09
um
9:12
and why exactly they're not or are uh
9:16
statistically significant for the
9:18
confidence interval of 95 uh% ient.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello. So, in today's video, I am going to be walking through a complete riskmanagement overhaul using the driver framework. So, I'm acting as the risk manager for a hedge fund that recently experienced an unexpected 8% 1-day loss, something our older system failed to detect to detect. My goal is to rebuild the firm's risk monitoring system using value at risk, expected shortfall, and stress testing, and to walk through the code cell by cell while explaining how each part contributes to a more resilient risk process. So for section zero, setup um discover loading libraries and initial setup. So first I start by importing all of the libraries needed for the analysis. So the nump py pandas map plot lib sepy and y finance. I also set formatting preferences to keep output clean and reproducible. This cell doesn't produce much visual output. That's normal but it sets up everything the rest of the notebook relies on. So then for section one data download that is for our discover pulling market data. So in the discover phase, I gather the data that will feed into the risk framework. I download daily prices for five large US equities. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and JP Morgan. This set gives the portfolio a realistic tilt towards large cap tech with a financial stabilizer. The output shows that I downloaded about 3,991 rows of clean price data. The tail of the data set displays the most recent trading dates and price levels. So then for our section two returns and stats, this is for our represent phase transforming prices into returns. So next I compute daily log returns which are preferred format for risk modeling because they're mathematically convenient and behave well in volatility modeling. The tail of the return data set confirms the transformation worked correctly. Then I annualize mean returns, volatility, and the full correlation matrix. So the annualized returns range from roughly 15 to 24%. While volatilities sit between 25 to 33%. The correlation matrix shows all assets are positively correlated. This will matter later when we think about diversification and VR. So then for our section three that is our portfolio construction and this is also for a represent phase. So defining weights in portfolio design or returns. So now I define the actual portfolio. I'll be analyzing 25% AAPL, 25% Microsoft, 20% Amazon, 15% Google, and 15% JP Morgan. So this gives the portfolio a heavy but realistic tech tilt. The portfolio daily return summary shows mean daily return is around um 0.8%, daily volatility is around 1.39%. And the worst historical day is about 12.82%. That worst day will resurface when we examine stress testing. So next for section four portfolio value plot. So this is also for the represent stage which is visualizing portfolio behavior. So I simulate 10 million investment starting in 2010. The plot shows long run growth into the tens of millions, but with significant down draw or draw downs during the 2018 volatility spike, the COVID crash and the periodic tech sell-offs. This makes clear that even high-erforming portfolios need strong risk controls. So next for section five, that is our historical VAR. So that is for our implement now empirical value at risk. So historical V directly uses the empirical return distribution. So for this $10 million portfolio, it's 95% V, which is around $224,000, and then the 99% V, which is around $390,000. So this means that historically the portfolio did not lose more than those amounts on 95% or 99% of trading days. So next for section six that is our parametric VAR. So this is for our implement as well normal distribution V. So now I calculate the variance co-variance V which assumes normality using the mean return and standard deviation means 95% parametric V is around $221,000 and 99% parametric V is around $316,000. So these are lower than the historical values especially at the 99%'s confidence level which hints at underestimation of tail losses by the normal model. Next for section seven, this is our CV which is also in the implement expected shortfall. So expected shortfall measures the average loss when we are already in the worst of days. So 95% of CV is around 323

is 323,000 and then our 99% CV is around $517,000. So these values are much larger than the corresponding V numbers highlighting deeper tail risk. So next for section 8 is the distribution plot. And this is for validate. So visual inspection of tail behavior. So I plot the return histogram and overlay the 95% and the 99% V cut offs. You can visually see the left tail is heavier than a normal distribution explaining why historical and CV values exceed normalbased V especially at high confidence levels. So next for section N that is our historical stress tests and this is also for validate stress testing against real events. So in this section I identified the worst 10 daily losses. So the worst day is March 16th 2020 and it was -12.82%. Most of the list comes from the COVID crash and a few additional severe draw downs appear in 2011 and 2022. So then I look at the major crisis windows. The GFC window shows no data due to my data set starting in 2010 and the COVID crash window shows a negative 11.63% cumulative loss with the worst day again at -12.82%. These results confirm that CO is the dominant stress event for this portfolio. So next is section 10 customer scenario tests or custom scenario tests. This is also for validate hypothetical shocks. So I then run these three hypothetical shock scenarios. So number one is 5% marketwide selloff. So this in turn cause the portfolio loses $500,000. Number two, tech crash. So, negative 10% tech, negative3% JPM. So, the portfolio loses $895,000. And then number three, financial crisis style shock. Portfolio loses $375,000.

These scenarios highlight the portfolio sensitivity to tech and complement the crisisbased stress tests. So then for section 11 interpretation and recommendations. So this is for our interpret what all the metrics tell. So if we go down to the results from all VR, CVR and stress test results, parametric V systematically underestimates risk. CVR reveals deeper tail losses. Real world maximum loss of -12.82% 82% is far worse than any V estimate and co created a draw down consistent with the worst tail events. This leads into actionable recommendations. So setting daily V limits tied to AUM use stop loss or degrossing rules add concentration limits on tech and combine V plus ES plus stress test plus liquidity metrics. So no single metric is sufficient alone. And then for section 12, our final section, limitations of V. So this is for our reflect why V must be part of a bigger F or a bigger system. So finally I explained the limitations of V. Um number one, model assumptions rarely match reality. Number two, V ignores what happens beyond the cutoff. Number three, V shrinks in calm markets and spikes in volatile ones. Number four, V ignores liquidity. And number five, VR struggle or V struggles with nonlinear portfolios. This is why modern risk management uses multiple metrics and not V in isolation. The purpose of this overhaul was to build a system that one identifies vulnerabilities, two quantifies extreme but plausible losses, three establishes risk limits and governance, and four prevents future unexpected drawdowns like the 8% loss that triggered this analysis. And this completes the full driver cycle for implementing V and stress testing. Thank you.",,0,1

Hello, my name is Lucas Casease and for
0:04
my week assignment, we're going to do a
0:06
deep dive of a case study into the
0:10
GameStop
0:12
crisis uh back in January of 2021. And
0:16
we're going to talk about market
0:17
efficiency and behavioral finance.
0:21
Uh so, first a bit of background
0:24
information on our
0:27
case study. We're going to talk about
0:31
uh market efficiency using the GameStop
0:34
short squeeze event. Uh we're going to
0:37
verify some stated facts, analyze price
0:41
behavior relative to the efficient
0:44
market hypothesis predictions and we're
0:47
going to evaluate uh market anomalies
0:51
and if those can be explained uh with
0:53
existing behavioral finance frameworks
0:56
or not.
0:57
So, the first step we're going to go
0:59
over is we're going to verify whether or
1:00
not GameStop traded at 4 cents in August
1:03
of 2020.
1:04
And if that is incorrect, we're going to
1:07
document the accurate figures. And then
1:11
here here's an event timeline as well.
1:14
Uh in August of 2020, GameStop was near
1:17
bankruptcy levels.
1:19
Um, and then the next month, a Ryan
1:23
Cohen, uh, a rich founder, acquired a
1:27
13% stake. In January of 21 is when the
1:31
short squeeze occurred and the price
1:33
surged to about $400.
1:36
And then in February, there were
1:39
congressional hearings on market
1:40
manipulation.
1:43
Some key data points is that throughout
1:45
that time, analyst fundamental value
1:49
estimates had GameStop at $10 to $40 a
1:52
share. And there were lots of people who
1:56
lost lots of money like hedge fund
1:58
manager
2:00
Melvin Capital. And that was one of the
2:02
reasons uh why Congress had to have
2:06
hearings about market manipulation.
2:09
So, diving straight into the first
2:11
statement that GameStop traded at 4
2:13
cents a share in August. This is false.
2:16
Uh, using Yahoo Finance through Google
2:20
Collab, I tracked that the lowest traded
2:23
price of the GameStop stock in August of
2:26
2020 was about a dollar. and you'll see
2:29
the graph of the daily and closing
2:32
prices from July of 2020 to March 2021
2:35
that I generated using Yahoo Finance and
2:38
Google Collab with Python.
2:41
Uh you'll see it's right around a dollar
2:44
uh from July
2:47
honestly through about December it
2:49
starts to rise slightly and then January
2:52
is obviously when our event occurs.
2:56
You'll also see that I created a daily
3:00
trading volumes from July 2020 to March
3:03
2021 of GameStop.
3:06
And you'll see that it's relatively
3:10
the trading volumes are relatively low
3:12
compared to the month of January and
3:15
early February where you'll see huge
3:17
spikes. Um overall these plots show a
3:22
stable period for GameStop from July
3:24
2020 through around December and then
3:27
there's a rapid increase in both that uh
3:30
closing price and trading volume which
3:33
indicates that that's when the short
3:35
squeeze event occurred.
3:43
Now, um, now that we've verified that
3:46
that previous information was false,
3:48
we're going to run a CAPM regression to
3:52
calculate the alpha and beta of the
3:54
Gamestock stock and compare that to
3:57
expected uh, S&P 500 returns to
4:01
uh, see if there was an abnormal return
4:03
and whether or not we need to talk about
4:06
what happened there. So the estimation
4:09
period we're going to use is from
4:11
September 1st to the end of 2020. And
4:14
our event period is from January is just
4:18
the month of January. And after I
4:21
performed the capital asset pricing
4:24
model regression using Python through
4:28
Google Collab, uh our alpha was 0.011.
4:33
Again, alpha is the excess return not
4:36
explained by
4:38
movement within the market. Uh in an
4:41
ideal market, uh this would be zero. And
4:45
then the beta that was calculated
4:47
was 1.834.
4:50
And this measures volatility compared to
4:52
the market. So for each 1% that the S&P
4:55
500 or the market moved, uh Gamestock
4:58
was moving at 1.84%.
5:01
So this tells us
5:03
that we need to figure out why exactly
5:06
GameStop is moving at such a higher rate
5:08
compared to the market.
5:11
Uh so using the regression that I
5:15
mentioned, I generated uh again via
5:19
Google Collab and Python a cumulative
5:21
abnormal return for GameStop during the
5:25
event of January. And you'll see that
5:28
the abnormal returns uh were at the for
5:32
the first few weeks were very low. And
5:35
as the short squeeze event occurred,
5:37
you'll see that they
5:39
uh rose exponentially very quickly. And
5:42
then again, the cumulative abnormal
5:44
return is just the sum of all individual
5:46
abnormal returns over the event period.
5:49
And by plotting it, we can see the exact
5:52
moment the stock price detached from the
5:54
fundamental expected value.
5:58
Now, we're going to talk about how this
6:00
happened and why it matters.
6:02
First, uh we're going to talk about what
6:04
is the efficient market hypothesis. This
6:07
is the theory that a stock's current
6:08
price already reflects all available
6:10
information and no one can beat the
6:12
market because there are no undervalued
6:14
or overvalued stocks. It comes in three
6:17
forms. Uh the first two we're going to
6:20
talk about are the weak form and strong
6:21
form. Weak form essentially bakes down
6:24
to all historical data is already baked
6:26
into price. So you can't predict future
6:28
prices by looking at past prices. And
6:31
the strong form is that all information
6:33
public or private which would include
6:35
insider trading is reflected in the
6:37
price. And this form is not my favorite
6:42
form because insider trading is illegal.
6:45
And the one that is most relevant to the
6:47
GameStop case is the semi-torrong form
6:50
which says that prices adjust instantly
6:52
to all public publicly available
6:54
information. Uh the example that comes
6:57
from the GameStop case would be the 140%
7:01
short interest report that they had as
7:03
well as the significant and sustained
7:06
positive cumulative abnormal returns
7:08
that we observed in my graph on the
7:10
previous slide. Uh those also suggest a
7:13
violation of at least the semi- strong
7:15
form of market efficiency
7:18
and the substantial deviation of
7:20
GameStop returns from what was expected
7:22
with its historical relationship with
7:24
the market which we tested with our
7:27
capital asset pricing model regression.
7:30
And that indicates that public
7:32
information and market sentiment
7:34
surrounding the short squeeze uh weren't
7:37
efficiently incorporated into the price.
7:40
Uh by extension, you could argue that
7:44
the game case violates the strong form
7:46
of market efficiency.
7:49
Um, also we're going to talk about
7:52
behavioral finance and this is the how
7:54
did this happen and uh the efficient
7:57
market hypothesis semi- strong form was
8:00
why it matters. Uh we're going to be
8:02
diving into like the people aspect of
8:04
this. So first off an intro into
8:07
behavioral finance. It's a field of
8:09
finance that argues psychological biases
8:11
and emotional factors uh such as greed
8:14
which is important one for investing
8:16
because you know everyone wants to make
8:17
more money. uh these influence investors
8:20
and make them irrational.
8:22
Uh one or two that are relevant to the
8:26
GameStop case are hurting and limits to
8:30
arbitrage.
8:31
Hurting is the tendency for individuals
8:34
to follow the actions of a larger group
8:36
even if those actions are uh irrational.
8:40
So for the GameStop case, uh this would
8:44
be all the people in the subreddit Wall
8:47
Street Bets who uh coordinated all
8:51
together and helped to drive the price
8:54
surge up to 400 plus.
8:58
As for limits to arbitrage, this is the
9:00
real world reasons why a rational
9:02
investor uh won't bet against a bubble.
9:06
Uh in the GameStop case, this was the
9:10
risk of uh ruin. You could say that the
9:13
stock would stay irrational longer than
9:16
the short stellar could stay solvent. Uh
9:19
this is an example of the hedge fund I
9:21
mentioned previously, Melbourne Capital.
9:24
Uh so in light of this, could a rational
9:28
investor have profited systematically?
9:31
I believe they could have. uh a rational
9:34
investor who identified the market
9:36
inefficiently.
9:37
the market inefficiency. Sorry.
9:40
definitely could have profited because
9:42
in the uh if you look back at our
9:45
cumulative uh abnormal return graph,
9:49
you'll see that the dramatic increase
9:51
indicates that any investor who bought
9:53
the GameStop stock and held it through
9:55
the short squeeze would have had returns
9:58
far above what was predicted by the
10:00
capital asset pricing model or even the
10:03
affforementioned
10:05
uh analyst estimates of GameStop stock
10:08
at around $10 to $40.
10:10
Uh so even though this would be risky
10:14
uh a rational investor could have
10:16
profited.
10:18
Overall though, the GameStop short
10:20
squeeze uh is a unique
10:23
event and the presence of these
10:26
significant and sustained admiral
10:27
returns
10:29
uh means that it would have been very
10:31
very risky and this uh unique event
10:36
is not something that is can be used to
10:40
like downtrod on uh the efficient market
10:43
hypothesis and it's just a direct
10:45
consequence of the breakdown in market
10:47
efficiency. as a result of hurting and
10:50
limits to arbitrage like we talked about
10:52
in behavioral finance. Uh, thank you so
10:55
much for your time and I hope you
10:57
learned a lot about the GameStop case
10:59
and how it relates to market efficiency
11:02
and behavioral finance. Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, this is my section six. No, no, sorry, my session 8 video assignment for the section six assignment. And in this case, I'm going to use the driver framework as as good as it can get. What I will do is what I did was use a template of the driver framework that that my AI helped me to do and then filled it out which will make uh the assignment better and more easier to understand. So first of all it was my define and discover stage. Specifically in the define what I did was stated that my goal was to test whether GameStop's extreme price movements were consistent with market efficiency and also to confirm if the claim that GME which was presented here that traded at 0.04 in August 2020 was true. Then specifically to discover which is this little part right here. What I did was to identify the data I needed with real GME prices from August 2020 to February 2021. Also the trading volume, event dates and some other basic concepts like the EMH forms and behavioral biases. Then in represent I outline my plan I which is gathering the pro the data creating a price chart a volume chart calculating daily returns and also identifying abnormal returns to test market efficiency. Then to in my implement section here is my code which I will enter to Gemini that will make a Google column for the Python code. Unfortunately, this code didn't work the first time. It said that it had some errors and after trying to correct them, the AI basically stuck. Gemini basically stuck. So, what I did was I took my prompt then put it into Chajbt in order to refine it so it will actually work and it imputed this right here which will I later put into Gemini which gave me my new code. So the code f first of all is the the section of the GME data from Yahoo Finances. Then h here is the table. Oh and something important to mention is that here the head function it will show the first rows of the data set. Yeah. So here is the chart output from August 2020. Prices are around $1 and this confirms that the claim that GME traded at 0.04 in August 2020 is false. Then I plotted it plot a closing price chart. This shows the rise from around a dollar in August to the spike of almost $500 in January. Then moving on, it's the volume chart which also like in this case it plotted the trading volume. The huge spikes in January match the timeline of the short squeeze and increase retail trading activity.
and finally here it calculated daily returns and printed the 10 biggest positive days. Some returns were over 100% in a single day which confirms extreme extremely abnormal returns. So after the implement we can move into the validate section which was here and in this section what I did was to interpret the results. The extreme returns and huge spikes in price and volume basically showed that the market did not behave efficiently. weak and semi strongs EMH were violated because prices did not move smoothly with information. And moving on into the evolve section here I explained that the investors should learn that behavioral forces like hering and FOMO can overpower fundamentals. Mispricing can occur and arbitrage is not always possible when risk and restrictions are high. Finally, my last stage, which is the reflection. So, what I reflected and what I learned is how EMH works in real markets and why it's important to verify the data. The GameStop events help me connect both efficiency, market theory, and behavioral finance. This was my video assignment. Thank you for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Heidi and this is my session a homework. Um, so for this week the define is that the research goal we have a we have to design a systematic analysis to determine one which form of the efficient market hypothesis um were violated by the GameStop event, two if the event is better explained by behavioral finance concepts. Three, whether systematic risk adjusted profit opportunities existed for rational well- capitalized investors. Here's some critical data verifications. So, first upon verifying the historic data for the is for the critical first stop. So, Gamestocks sorry GameStop's stock did not trade at 0.04 in August 2020. The actual adjusted closing price range for August 2020 was approximately $1.04 to $1.67 according to Yahoo Finance. Here's the represent. Here is the event studied timeline. First, we have an estimation period between from August 2020 to December 2020 where the established where we establish the stocks beta and normal return pattern using capital asset pricing model. Um event period one is between September to December in 2020 where Ryan Cohen acquisition. It is to test for abnormal returns following the initial private information and public announcements. Event two event period 2 is January where the short squeeze peak happened. Um it is to test for massive abnormal returns during the Reddit driven mania. Number four is the postevent period from which is from February 2020 and onwards. It is to test for continued drift and return to a normal price. Here's the formula we'll be using. We'll be using the um abnormal rate return rate and the estimated return rate here where RT is actual return for GameStop and RMT is the market return. Here is the implement which is the code that asked that I asked Google Gemini to prompt for me and it calculates for the using capital using the two equations and we get the abnormal return analysis during event period from 2020 January 1st to January 10. And here's the like a pattern and for every day. And then here is the same period but with accumulated abnormal return. And according to the um efficient market hypothesis test during squeeze period which is January 2020 the average daily abnormal nor abnormal rate return is0.51%. And then the total accumulated um abnormal return is5.73%. So to validate or um calculation um the we have two methods. First one is statistical significance. Here I used it to here this is the t value that I used the data to cap to calculate with the hypo hypothetical mean of zero and a significant level of 0.05. So the statistic significance with the t value of 4.6 Six. This strong T value provides robust evidence against the no hypothesis and confirms the abnormal return observed during the GameStop event were not due to random market noise or expected fluctuation. So that there is a pattern during the event. Another one is economic significance which will be using cost benefit analysis which is to compare the calculated abnormal return against high transaction cost short selling cost borrowing fees and market impact that shows that the raw abnormal return is likely economically significant but the high cost and risk for the arbitrator limits its exploitability. So to sums up um the GameStop events of normal returns are overwhelmingly statistically significant and economically large. However, the limits to arbitrage are the key factors preventing these anomalies from being immediately corrected by rational investors. The persistent of the anomaly is therefore explained by these limits, not a failure of analytical models alone. Here's the evolve. In evolve we're going to see that the violations of efficient market hypothesis and the ex behavior behavioral explanations to the violations during weak form the um which um prices reflect all past price and volume data. So the violation to that is the enormous short interest and subsequent buying momentum created a pattern of predictable future returns. And the explanation to the behavior is the momentum trading and hurting which retail investors driven by social media followed a trend turning a technical pattern into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Semi strong form is that um prices reflect all publicly available informations. So that violation is the price of $483 widely diverged from the publicly known an analyst fundamental value estimates of $10 to $40. Um it is such a wide gap. So the behavior explanation to that is the anchoring and loss aversion. So investors anchored the to the stock director and experienced loss aversion on short position driven the price beyond rational limits. And the strong form is when prices reflect all information including private and insider informations. So that violation is that Ryan Cohen's acquisition of a 13% stake in December 2020, which is a nonpublicly known intent initially, leads to a significant price raise suggesting markets hadn't fully priced this insider activity immediately and that the explanation to this behavior is information asymmetry. Although Cohen's stake became public, the true long-term intent and the private information about the retail interest or short interest level were not perfectly reflected. And the here is another the strategic implications for per for portfolio management. So we're going to talk about the GameStop event reinforcing the most efficient view which are when markets are efficient enough that most active strategies fail after costs but ain't efficient enough that superior and analysis impatient capital can occasionally find opportunities. So first is the active versus passive strategy. So the GameStop invent argues for a hybrid approach where the core portfolio management should be passive indexing due to the difficulty of consistently beating the market. A small dedicated portion should be allocated to active strategies that specifically targets no market anomalies or exploit behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage in less efficient segments. And the next one is policy implications. The event highlighted significant market micro structure issues which includes trade settlements mechan settlements mechanics and margin requirements which suggests policy may need to evolve to manage risks introduced by high frequency high volume retail tradings. And to reflect I'm going to talk about the rational investor profitability analysis which is the differences between expose analysis and exonte analysis. Um expose analysis is where um people will see the events value the events after the historical factors which is after when event the event has happened. So in an expose analysis which is hindsight a rational investor could have profited profited handsomely by buying GameStop in August 2020 and selling near the peak in January 2021 but that is afterwards and we cannot travel back to time. So Xante analysis is before so we can predict how the future goes kind of. So for rational institutional investors, systematic profit opportunities were likely absent or too risky. So they don't see GameStop as a worthy um as something worthy to invest in because there's too much like risks happening. Um the initial runup post Cohen's announcement was a semi- strong violation, but the January squeeze was driven by non-fundamental factors and lacked information advantages. Irational arbiters aiming the short and stock to aiming to short the stock back to fundamental value would have been wiped out by the short squeeze demonstrating the severe unqualifi unquantifiable risks known as arbitric risk. So that just shows that before the event it is too risky to invest in, but after the event it is a good um deal to invest in to buy GameStop in August 2021 2020 and sell it during the peak in January 2021. But we cannot see the future and we cannot travel back in time. So beforehand it looks too risky and afterwards we lost a chance. Thank you.",,0,1

Hello, my project is an investigation
0:03
into market efficiency using the 2021
0:07
GameStop short squeeze as a case study.
0:11
So, the core question is, was this event
0:14
a black swan
0:17
that broke the market or can it be
0:19
explained? And crucially, what does it
0:23
tell us about the efficient market
0:25
hypothesis?
0:27
So to conduct this analysis I follow the
0:30
driver framework. This process is
0:32
mandatory for assignment. So
0:35
I'm just going to get started. Um
0:40
so the entire process begins with stage
0:43
one um define and discover. The define
0:47
part is simple. Define the problem. The
0:50
prompt askked us to analyze the GME
0:52
event test EMH and evaluate behavioral
0:57
financial finance. The discover part is
1:01
the most critical first step. This isn't
1:04
about analysis. It's about factchecking.
1:08
We're not allowed to proceed until we
1:11
verify the data we're given.
1:14
Um my discovery work found this is
1:19
factually incorrect which is that the
1:22
assignment provided a critical first
1:24
step which is to verify the statement
1:27
GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020.
1:33
Um,
1:34
I searched historical market data and
1:37
GME's lowest price in all of 2020 was
1:42
2.5 uh $2.55
1:46
in August 2020. It was trading around
1:49
$4.
1:51
Um, this DND process was invaluable. It
1:56
stopped a critical data error before it
1:59
could position the analysis. I also used
2:03
this stage to verify the other facts
2:05
which were correct. Short interest did
2:08
peak over 140%. And the Melvin capital
2:12
did lose 53% of its value.
2:17
Now moving on to the second stage which
2:19
is represent. Um this is the planning
2:23
stage after discover but before
2:25
implement. So this is where I designed
2:27
the how for the analysis. My plan had
2:30
two parts. First part is a technical
2:33
plan. I would use a Python and a Y
2:37
finance library to download GME's price
2:40
and volume data. So to test a weak form
2:44
of EMH, my plan was to chart a price
2:48
against its 50 and 200 day moving
2:52
averages.
2:54
And um my second one, my second plan is
2:58
a qualitative plan. So to test a semi
3:02
strong form, I would compare the market
3:05
price to the publicly available facts we
3:09
just verified like the $10 and to $40
3:14
analyst
3:15
targets.
3:18
So with a solid plan, I move to stage
3:21
three, which is implement. So right here
3:24
are the codes. Um first I download the
3:28
GME's price and volume data. This chart
3:33
right here
3:36
is the first result that implementation.
3:40
It perfectly visualizes the event. On
3:43
the top you can see the price flat
3:46
flattered for um
3:48
some years for years and then the
3:51
explosion in January 2021.
3:55
On the bottom you see the trading volume
3:57
showing that the price peak was driven
4:00
by an absolutely unprecedented surge in
4:04
trading activities.
4:06
It's crazy. Um next I implemented the
4:10
plan to test a weak form. I calculated
4:13
the 50-day and 200 day moving averages
4:16
and plotted them against the price. So
4:21
this is the result chart. However,
4:23
nothing came out which I'm still working
4:26
on but
4:29
that is what I am trying to do. Now
4:32
we're on stage four which is validate.
4:35
Um the implement stage g gave me charts
4:39
and validate stage is where I interpret
4:42
what they mean. So first the moving
4:44
average chart the weak form EMH status
4:50
um states that you can't use past price
4:53
data like moving averages or predict
4:56
future moves. The price should be um a
5:00
random walk. This chart is not a random
5:03
walk. It shows a massive sustained
5:07
uh deviation from the historical
5:10
average. This is a clear visual
5:13
validation that the weak form EMH was
5:17
violated. Um second I uh validated the
5:22
semi strong form. This form says price
5:26
reflects all publicly available
5:29
information. The public info include
5:32
included analyst targets of $10 to $40.
5:37
The market price hits $483.
5:41
The price was completely detached from
5:45
public fundamentals. Therefore, the semi
5:48
strong form was also violated.
5:53
So then moving on to our next um second
5:56
to last stage which is expose where I
6:00
synthesize everything into a final
6:03
answer. So if the market wasn't
6:05
efficient what was going on the answer
6:08
is behavioral finance
6:10
hurting.
6:12
So um what the r/wall street bets was a
6:18
mechanism that allows thousands of
6:20
individual investors to act as a single
6:24
herd. Uh second one being limits to
6:27
arbitrage
6:30
rage ema
6:32
assumes rational investors will short
6:36
the stock back to its real value but
6:39
they couldn't. Why is that? Because the
6:42
cost to borrow shares was too high and
6:46
the risk was infinite. So, as Melvin
6:49
Capital learned, um the Robin Hood
6:52
buying restrictions were uh a literal
6:56
limit to arbitrage.
6:59
Finally, could a rational investor have
7:02
profited? No. So, this wasn't a
7:06
systematic, repeatable strategy. it was
7:09
a lottery and EMH is concerned with
7:14
systematic opportunities not lotteryies.
7:18
So lastly, finally going up to um our
7:22
review stage which is right here. You
7:26
can see
7:28
um
7:30
the process worked perfectly and uh the
7:34
driver framework by forcing me to start
7:36
with the fine and discovery
7:39
uh was the most important part of this
7:42
assignment. It saved me from using bad
7:45
data. Uh the conclusion is clear. the
7:48
game stop if that is perfect case is a
7:51
perfect case study um of a behavioral
7:55
market. It proves that while markets are
7:58
mostly effective, they're not perfectly
8:01
efficient. And when you a unique set of
8:04
conditions
8:06
align, a social catalyst, a clear enemy,
8:10
and limits on
8:13
arbitrage, mass psychology can
8:17
temporarily and
8:20
um spectacularly
8:22
defeat fundamental logics. So basically
8:26
what we learned is that we can never
8:29
control the market and predictions can
8:32
always
8:35
fall off. So I think that's it. Thank
8:38
you for listening and that is my session
8:42
sess session eight project.

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone. Today we're going to be
doing session eight and we're going to
be using the driver framework to help us
walk through the problem. So before we
get into the driver framework, I just
want to go through the event and
timeline that we were given. And so the
event that we're looking at today is the
GameStop short squeeze. And so we were
given the event timeline, but I created
a little simpler one down here just so
so people understand the situation. So
hedge funds pretty much made bets that
the stock of GME was going to fall. And
then some people on Reddit were actually
optimistic optimistic about GameStop
stock. And then with this optimism
outlook and the knowledge of the amounts
of short interest, people coordinated
massive buying a massive buying campaign
for GME stock. And so with this buying
campaign, the stock price increased and
then the hedge funds were forced to buy
back shares to cover their short
positions and limit their losses. And in
the end, the hedge funds had significant
losses and the retailers made some huge
profits.
So just to understand some of these key
data points that we were given, the
short interest peaked at 140% of the
float. So this means that there was more
short sales than available trading stock
in the market. And then for the retail
trading volume, it increased 10fold
during the squeeze. And this is was
because of the movement that they
created to buy GME stock and it drew
more attention and more people started
buying. And then there were trading
restrictions implemented at the peak by
the Robin Hood app. They basically
allowed people to not buy GameStock, but
they could only sell it. And then the
hedge fund Melbourne Capital sustained
53% loss and they required bailout. And
this was because they since they
borrowed GME stock and short sold it um
they had to buy stock back at a at a
higher price later. And then analysts um
fundamental value estimates that GME
stock was only 10 to $40 per share and
not that high price that these retail
investors drove it up to. Onto the
define and discovered part of the driver
framework. First, we need to outline
what our objective is and that is to
calculate and analyze the abnormal
returns during the event period to
investigate whether GameStop short
squeeze event proves that the market is
inefficient or efficient. And in our
scope and horizon, we are analyzing the
GameStop short squeeze like I said and
it occurred during 2020 and 2021. Our
constraints are that we are only limited
to the historic data that we have access
to. And for data inventory, we need to
validate that the following statement is
accurate that we were given that was
Gamestock traded at 0.04 cents. And then
we were given a timeline of the event
and key data points. And I did check
everything and I watched a lot of
YouTube videos to kind of understand
this event and what actually went down.
And then the key equation that we're
going to be using is that abnormal
returns
our actual minus the return that's
expected. And then the success metric is
that if our statistical analysis on
abnormal returns has a p value less than
alpha, then we will know if the market
is efficient or not. And then our
benchmark and sanity check is that if we
were able to explain the gap between the
fundamental valuation of that $10 to $40
compared to the stock price high that we
are going to find is that the result of
our abnormal return calculations will
make sense along with our verdict of
whether the market is efficient or not.
So first is this statement correct?
Gamestock traded at 4 cents. So this is
correct. I did find this. I looked on
Yahoo
And I actually found that during August
it was in a range of $14 and $167.
And here's what I would send to the
professor to correct him. So for this
define and discover stage, I think it
would be really important to define what
the efficient market hypothesis actually
is. And that is that it the stock prices
fully reflect all available information
making it possible to consistently
achieve make it impossible to
consistently achieve abnormal returns
through analysis of publicly available
data. And so what EMH is basically
saying is that it's virtually impossible
to beat the market and achieve above
average risk adjusted returns through
active trading strategies. And some of
the key predictions that EMH makes is
that the stock price changes are
essentially unpredictable.
They the prediction is that it attempts
to identify under attempting to identify
undervalued or overvalued stocks is
pointless because all relevant
information is already incorporated into
the price. The best strategy for that EM
says is that passive investing is the
better way to go and that for returns
are risk adjusted. So any higher returns
achieved are simply compensation for
taking on for taking higher level of
risk not the result of superior skill or
information.
So there's three forms of EMH. We have
the weak form where price reflects all
past price and volume data and this is
where techn technical analysis does not
work. The semi-rong form where price
reflects all publicly available
information. Neither technical or
fundamental analysis can generate excess
returns for this form. And then the
strong form is that price reflects all
public and private insider information.
So no one can consistently achieve
excess returns. Onto the represent
stage, we need a quality framework for
analyzing efficiency around specific
events. And so we're going to be using
the event study methodology, which is a
common methodology used to test the
semi- strong form of market efficiency
by observing behavior of stocks returns
around a specific event. And again, this
does only test mainly semi-strong form
of EMH, but we can make inferences about
the other forms using the context of our
calculations and other details about the
situation. And so here I created a
little timeline of or a little walk
through of what we're going to be doing.
First, we need to identify the event
that we're looking at to find the event
window. Normal, we need to do a normal
return estimation. have a normal return
estimation period, then calculate the
abnormal return returns, and then we're
going to be doing a statistical
analysis. And so here I have my event
study timeline. So the estimation period
where we're going to be establishing
what the normal return pattern actually
is. I chose to be July 20th, 2020 to
January 8th, 2021.
And the event window is going to be from
January 11th to January 27th, which day
zero, the highest peak closing price
happened on January 27th. And so then
we're going to be looking for the
postevent period. And this is going to
be after
January 27th, so January 28th to
February 19th to see if there are still
abnormal returns after the event window.
I got these efficiency benchmarks for
the book book. So for strong efficiency
all abnormal returns would be on day
zero. For semi- strong efficiency
returns would be complete within 1 to
two days. And then for weak efficiency
drift may continue but only due to new
information. And for our return analysis
these are going to be the equations that
we are going to be using to calculate
them. So on to implement we need a
systematic execution of the event study
methodology. So let's go and look at my
code. So to walk through the code pretty
quickly here, it just outlines what the
estimation start and end date for
looking for those normal returns. And
then it outlines what the estimation
start and end date is and that peak
event date that we discussed. And then
it is going to be fetching the data from
Yahoo Finance.
And then here it's just estimating the
market model parameters um alpha and
beta. And then it goes into actually
calculating the abnormal returns and the
cumulative
abnormal returns. Here are those
equations for the expected return which
they're going the the equation for
calculating the normal return. Sorry.
And then they're going to be finding the
abnormal return and then calculating the
cumulative abnormal return. And then I
also did to make a graph for the
cumulative abnormal returns.
And then here's the output. You can see
the output that it used and the beta
that it used. And then it shows us the
event timeline and gives us the stock
return, the market return, the expected
return, the abnormal return, and the
cumulative abnormal return. So we can
see that the abnormal return gets very
high during the peak event period. And
then the cumulative abnormal return gets
increasingly high and stays pretty high
throughout the whole event window. Down
here it says that the cumulative
abnormal return over the full event
window was 234%
which is very high and the abnormal
return on the peak day was 137.97%.
So here's a graph of the cumulative
abnormal returns and you can see that
they get increasingly high during the
event period and they stay pretty high
even after so and so this definitely
shows that there's some type of
violation to the EMH.
If the EMH were true then there would
not be so much abnormal returns
happening throughout the event period
and it would just really be on one day.
But as you can see that is not the case
here. So here's some conclusions from
what we saw from the high ARS and the
high C with the highly positive C. This
means that over the entire event period,
the stock's performance was vastly
superior to what its fundamentals and
risk factors would have predicted and
then this would be a strong violation of
EMH. The high C shows the asset was
significantly mispriced and that
investors were earning abnormal returns
in the efficient market. Says that
prices should instantly reflect all
information but the high C means the
price adjustment was not efficient and
there was still abnormal returns after.
So now coming back to those efficiency
benchmarks. Um this is what the book
says that for strong efficiency all
abnormal returns on day would be on day
zero but this did obviously did not
happen and then for semi- strong returns
complete within one to two days this
definitely did not happen it was strung
out way longer and then for weak
efficiency the drift may contribute but
only due to new information again the CR
was for a much longer period and it the
C was definitely higher after the new
information came out So using more of
the context of the situation to look
over each of these forms for semi-
strong form, it was definitely violated
because of that existence of the
cumulative returns that were up to 400%.
This means that the stock price was
detached dramatically from what its
fundamental publicly verifiable value
would suggest and that there were
riskadjusted excess profits that were
achievable with only using public
information. And then for the weak form,
it was definitely vi violated because
the retail investors used publicly
available statistic about the high short
interest which led to the predictable
short squeeze and massive profits and
there was non-random return patterns
definitely present there. And then for
the strong form, it was definitely
violated. Since the weak form and the
semi- strong form um are strongly
violated, it's highly likely that the
strong form is also violent. But we also
have the fact that We know that the
trading platform Robin Hood suddenly
restricted the ability of retail
investors to buy GME shares and this
action was based on internal non-public
constraints.
So all in all the GME price movement was
not a rational efficient adjustment to
public fundamental information but it
was definitely an abnormal market
reaction.
So to quickly run through and validate
um I did statistical significance
testing and I used a robust t test
because the data violated some of the
assumptions for a regular t test. So
this one was a little bit better. And so
here you can see the hypothesis. The
null is that the average of normal
return over the event window is going to
be zero. But the alternative is that the
average abnormal return over the event
window is going to not be zero. And so
if it is an efficient market the average
abnormal return will be zero and if it's
inefficient it's not going to be zero.
So let's take a look at my code for the
sake of time I won't be running through
the code but I will show you the output
here and it does show that the robust t
statistic was 7.8 And the p value was
way below the alpha and it is way below
zero also.
Sorry, I meant to say that it is pretty
much zero.
And here we have a little bit of a
conclusion. Since the robust p value is
less than or equal to alpha, we reject
ho. And this means that the semi- strong
market efficiency
is not true. Like the market appears
inefficient.
So from the code we know that we are
going to be rejecting the null and this
means that we can assume market
inefficiency and that there was an
anomaly taking place. So onto the evolve
we're looking at the application of
efficiency insights to investment
strategy. So in general for an efficient
market the passive strategy is better
because it's impossible to beat the
market. So the high fees for the active
strategy wouldn't be worth it. And then
for inefficient markets, the active
strategy would be worth it because you
can beat the market. And then for each
of the EM forms, there's different
investment strategies that you can use.
For strong efficiency, it's better to
use passive index investing. For semi-
strong efficiency, you should focus on
private information and superior
analysis. And then for weak efficiency,
fundamental analysis can work and te
technical analysis cannot.
In the real world, professionals don't
look markets as being binary. So they're
not just efficient or inefficient, but
they assess market efficiency as a
spectrum based on specific
characteristics continually testing for
pricing anomalies.
So fund managers who practice that
active strategy look for the inverse of
what creates high efficiency and in an
effective market it has a high number of
participants high information
availability slash transparency high
liquidity and low transaction costs and
low barriers to entry for arbitrage.
So like I was saying there's a spectrum
of efficiency that they have for
developed markets like the US they think
it's semi- strong but for emerging
markets they think it's weak form for
large cap stocks they think it's highly
efficient for small cap stocks it's less
efficient for highly liquid fixed income
it's very high efficiency but for niche
and alternative assets it's low effic
efficiency
there are arguments for active
management even with the majority of
markets being semi strong fund managers
say that there are behavioral finance
biases and anomalies that they can
exploit. They also say that they argue
that active management is the reason for
efficient markets and through superior
analytical frameworks they could create
anformational advantage.
So since we know that EMH was violated
for this event for the GM short squeeze,
what was at play here? What can explain
why the price was driven so high? And so
we can look into a few of those reasons.
First, we have the micro structure issue
which was that the short interest
surpassed 140% of the publicly available
float and this pretty much guaranteed a
price spiral once those retail buying
investors caught on to this. Then the
price also continued to be mispriced
because of these limits to arbitrage.
First we have the noise trade risk which
happened because thousands of individual
retail investors were coordinating on
Reddit. They were acting on a powerful
narrative and momentum rather than the
company's financial fundamentals and the
squeeze those arbitrageers out. And then
the second one is the implementation
cost. Since GME was one of the most
shorted stocks on the market, the high
short interest meant the cost to borrow
shares to short sell became extremely
high and the stock itself was hard to
borrow. So this limited new arbitrageers
coming into the market and lowering down
that price. The third one is fundamental
risk. The risk that the company's
fundamentals would change. In the
beginning
um the short sellers knew that GME was
going down but now there's the risk of
it going up since a lot of those retail
investors are driving up the price.
Another thing that can explain the
anomaly is behavioral finance where
we're looking at how psychological
factors influence financial decision-
making of individuals and the financial
markets. And so here I've listed a few
of the different behavioral finance um
topics that were at play here. First is
overconfidence bias. Many of the retail
investors exhibited overconfidence
believing that they had identified a
surefire way to outsmart and defeat
those hed funge and so this made them
buy and hold on to GME stock. And then
we have hurting which was caused through
Reddit. We have a bunch of retail
investors getting together to drive up
the price of stock and then this made
more investors want to join in on the
profits. and then FOMO which is kind of
the same thing because people saw the
gains that other retail investors were
having and they wanted to be involved in
getting some of those gains. Then we
have investor sentiment in social media.
So Reddit was the primary engine for
driving and coordinating the positive
sentiment for GME. the post um in
discussions created a strong narrative
of David against Goliath and they wanted
to beat the powerful hedge funds and so
the this caused emotional investing and
so on to emotional trading. The trading
of GME was heavily influenced by anger
against the hedge fund, excitement with
their gains, and then they wanted to get
revenge against the hedge funds. And so
these emotions motivated investors to
buy and hold the stock despite
overwhelming financial logic, suggesting
massive decline was going to be
inevitable. And then lastly, the
momentum effects. There was just a cycle
of the price rising for short covering,
new momentum buying, and then the price
rising again. And so this definitely
played a part why that price was so high
from what the market would have
expected. And so I want to do just some
extra evaluation on this problem and to
dive a little bit deeper into the
situation. Let's assess the information
advantages. So the hedge funds had the
fundamental information advantage in the
beginning because they were shorting the
stock and they saw that J was going
down. But the information about the
short interest was definitely an
advantage for those retail investors.
And then the retail investors had the
advantage because they could organize
and disseminate info on social media.
And then evaluate whether rational
investors could have profited
systematically. In the beginning, hedge
funds were profiting systematically from
shorting the GMA stock. But the short
squeeze event was not a place where
retail investors could profit
systematically. So time after time would
they do this? No. because this was a
high-risk one-time event.
So, yes, they did profit throughout the
event, but could they do this over time?
No, because eventually the price did go
down. And then the asset substitution
problem. This involves the hedge funds
in the fact that they had unlimited
liability associated with losing their
short position in GME. So during the
short squeeze, these hedge funds started
to lose a lot of money and so this made
them think that they had really nothing
to lose and so they would hold on to the
fact they would
sorry. So since they had nothing little
to lose at this point since they already
lost a lot, they would take on more risk
and try to save their capital instead of
immediately buying back. Some of them,
the really desperate ones who thought
they had nothing to lose at this point,
had an incentive to double down and wait
in hopes that their capital could be
saved.
Lastly, onto the reflection. So, the
image pretty much describes the ideal
market. So, the investor is r rational
and logical. The market price is just
the intrinsic value. Anomalies don't
exist. And the arbitrage is that instant
correction of all mispricing. But
behavioral finance, the perspective of
behavioral finance is really the reality
that investors do have bias and emotion
that the market price does is the
intrinsic value but also sentiment and
bias that there are anomalies due to
psychological bi biases and that there
are limitations to arbitrageers.
So if we were evaluating whether market
anomalies constitute evidence against
market efficiency
um this situation proves against my
strong form because the price showed the
effects of her behavior and collective
sentiment. I would say that market
anomalies do constitute evidence against
market efficiency because anomalies
suggest that prices are occasionally
mispriced due to factors not fully
accounted for. They suggest that there
is consistent exploitable patterns that
allow for abnormal returns and they
suggest that investor behavior like
biases and irrationality and market
frictions allow mispricing to persist.
So, in conclusion, since I've already
gone so long, sorry. In conclusion, the
market is mostly efficient, but there is
still imperfections that exist, such as
market anomalies and mispricing,
behavior, biases, and limits to
arbitrage. The GME short space squeeze
was a prime example of a challenge to
EMH. Thank you so much for listening.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Isabella Corrales and today we are analyzing the GameStop short squeeze from August 2020 to February 2021. So the goal is simple. Did the market act efficiently? So we will determine which forms of the efficient market hypothesis were that were broken and use the behavioral finance to explain why GME price went from a few dollars to nearly 500. Far above its fundamental value. So let's start with the facts. It says to verify that this statement is true, and if not, what is it? So. For that, um, I can go over here. So it is claimed that the GameStop was trading at just 4 cents, but that's not true. And I and if I go to the Yahoo Finance. It will show it down. If I scroll down to the right date. At 1.67 for close value, so. That is 1.67 per share at the close for August. So it's still low, but it is nowhere near zero or the four cents that it was at. It also states the same number and this on this website. So I verified that very quick timeline, which we can jump back over here. We have that the that Ryan Cohen acquires 13% stake which I did validate in this website briefly show right here is position at 12.9 stakes so which is about 9 million shares so rounded up that's 13% but just to show that I did validate that along with over here when it says that when Reddit and Wall Street bets drove the price surge up to 483 that is also confirmed here and I mean you get the just but it says that it was actually over 500 so that was a little different near 30 times the original valuation And then the short interest peaked at 140 afloat, which actually did as well say in this website, but also in this one. So that was honestly, I think easier to find than on the other. Oh yeah, it was easier to find on the other website. There we go. Approximately 140% of GameStop's public float had been sold short. So anyway, yes, all these things were verified. To go on with it, we have the aftermath that hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss. Um, our 10, say that analysts estimated a 10 to 40 per share, which clearly is not what happened. And that trading restrictions also happened, um, at Robinhood, which is true. So to represent this information, it's about how we are going to analyze it. And that is through the weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form. So for the weak form, prices already reflect all past price data. So to kind of implement that, we have to see if the GameStop broke the rules of that market efficiency form. So In the weak form, since prices just kept rising and people made money just by following the trends, it looks like you could take what was happening, like the past movements, and make momentum out of that because of the fact that people would jump on the trend and could predict those short-term gains that they were seeing other people get. So from that angle, it seems to violate that weak form efficiency because of the recent price trends provided those profitable signals. For semi-strong form, it's the prices reflect all public info, such as like the news and announcements. For this, I would say that the surge that happened here in January 2021 violated the semi-strong form because as down here as I was saying they just predicted the 10 to 40 but that cannot justify the actual price reaching hundreds of dollars and this jump was mainly caused by public social media which is the Reddit um and the wall street bets um different retail buying and just heavy option trading so under the semi strong The public information should actually represent or reflect the prices, but here the prices rose and fell wildly or widely with online discussions instead of actual like fundamentals. It was more of the social media aspect than actual economic sense. And then strong form. So strong form prices reflect all of the info, even like insider info. And for this, the strong form was also violated because, well, it usually is in most markets because it says that even, you know, insiders cannot earn excess profits, but In this situation, I think some early traders, option riders, and investors who could predict that retail surge made huge gains, which just, I kind of think, you know, can suggest that some people just had a good timing, like better timing advantage. But I think testing this fully would require some more of that insider private. trading data, but, you know, to go down. Okay, yeah, yeah. So that was these first two. And then Right here, evaluate whether the rational investors could have profited systematically. So I would say some did, but consistent, excuse me, but consistent low risk profits were nearly impossible. Really the early buyers and if you have the hedge funds with long or options exposure earned huge gains, ones that were in it at the beginning rather than the short sellers like the Melvin up here, which sustained that 53% loss. So this kind of shows that this systematic profit was limited because the shorting carried unlimited upgrade or upside risk. Yeah, 140% for the 140% that was there, which means that the short interest exceeded the, as you can tell, exceeded 100%, which restricts arbitrage. Arbitrage, yeah. And to go on with the fact that trading restrictions were implemented, this um made the volatility uncertain and um then with yeah then with the clearing the congressional hearings um you know had just collateral demands that just disrupted trading as well um and then the behavioral forces with the social media momentum, overpowered actual fundamentals and timing models, although some people could. So really, yeah, only the investors willing to take that extreme risk or just for some reason timed the market perfectly were able to profit. But most rational investors, sustainable like low risk gains were just not really possible. But so to compare the efficient market hypothesis prediction to observed behavior, I would say that the it is observed in the rapid, the rapid increase of the price and Just that prices, it diverse or diverged massively from the fundamentals. As you know, we already talked about the analysts thought it would be $10 to $40 versus the hundreds of dollars. So price dynamics were strongly correlated with the social media activity in retail auctions. such the volume just flows rather than the actual fundamental data. And yeah, so and then also some just academic and regulatory reports that I looked documented that those social media posts were is what caused those spikes in volume and price. So validated that thought. Excuse me. And then also the market microstructure with the constraints of the up here, the hearings, the market manipulation there. And then we have the trading restrictions here. These large just disconnects like it affected the ability to trade. So out those outcomes could have not been predicted by the EMH because they this happened in the February 2021, you know, so it was not predicted. So yeah, it predicted much smaller, more fundamentally driven values than the actual observed behavior of what happened, which was driven by more retail action and momentum, which is inconsistent with the semi strong for the EMH. And to kind of validate, I guess, why the markets did break down. So And just another term for what I was talking about is herding. And this is that the investors piled in because everyone else was buying, especially like with the Reddit and Wall Street Bets influence and you know, overconfidence could be another way to say how these early wins that people made like encouraged other people or made other people think that they could also win and they wouldn't lose any. Which, you know, is also just non-financial motives with the whole jumping on The bandwagon of to fight Wall Street, which is what the movement was on Reddit. And then, so yeah, that emotional motivation kept the price high at the 483 and even reported in a different site was above 500. So just around that 500 price, even when it really made no sense. So, Yeah. And then kind of some of the actual fundamental things with the 140%. So the GameStop had 140% of its available shares shorted, meaning that there were more shares borrowed than actually existing for trading. So. That created guaranteed buying pressure once this squeeze did start. And, you know, since this was such a miss priced stock, you know, 10 to 40, like they weren't, they didn't price that right. It became too, too risky. And these losses can be evident at the as you know, the Melvin lost 53%. And then just another thing that when the oops, you know, when there are the restrictions on buying, it shows that it showed how fragile it actually the market system actually was because with these restrictions, it couldn't really handle, the infrastructure itself couldn't really handle the volatility. So just a combined effect of behavioral forces drove prices up while the structural barriers of these restrictions kept rational investors from restoring efficiency Um, which really just, you know, it all pops. Um, but to kind of reflect, I guess, on what we learned, um, GameStop, I'd say proved that the market is usually efficient, usually just, I don't know, it was usually kind of on the lower side. But with this social media hype and the emotional investing that went into this and the structural stress, it all collided and efficiently just efficiency completely just breaks down. Yeah, I would say it's kind of just supports what some would say is a frictional market. But, you know, it works well just on it's it works okay on its regular day. But having all of that pressure, it just gave out. So I would say kind of some maybe lessons for that type of scenario would be to have more transparency around those short positions so that these short interests can not spiral 140%. Yeah, I would also say that these, these, you know, different restrictions and rules, I guess, should be reviewed to prevent brokers from having to halt trading. And yeah, definitions of these market manipulations need to be updated to include like coordinated trading and on social media platforms. So I would say just short summary of the GameStop was just a wasn't just a funny story of, wow, this, you know, social media posts made it go up, made the stock go up. It was a real test of exactly how efficient a market really can be and shows just the psychology and emotion and some market, you know, mechanics. like the market manipulation or everything when it collides, how strong and efficient is your market or is that pressure too much for it like it was with the GameStop. So yeah, because it can fall apart fast even if you've got something steady going. But yeah, definitely things to take into account. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"All right. Hello. Um, it's Vincent
Crawl. This is a session 8 assignment
and this the comprehensive investigation
into GameStop uh the short squeeze of
2020 and 2021 and we're going to be
using the driver framework uh to test
the core assumptions of the efficient
market hypothesis or EMH. Our objective
is to determine which forms of market
efficiency were violated and evaluate
the robustness of behavioral finance as
explanatory framework for this
significant market anomaly. So first
we're going to be looking at the
assignment and doing the defined stage.
Um, this establishes our core research
question is how did a struggling
retailer GameStop fundamentally valued
between 10 and $40 per share achieve an
astonishing peak price of nearly $483.
Um, it's just a massive disconnect. Um,
and it's forming the basis for our
investigation.
Uh, the discover phase. Uh so we need to
see all the key facts in the prompt
given of the assignment and that gives
us our critical fact check result. Uh
this assignment uh claimed GameStop
traded at 4 cents in August 2020 and the
historical data verification confirmed
that this is incorrect.
What did I do?
All right.
Um
the accurate data um the historical
closing price for GameStop at the end of
August 2020 was $6.68
approximately.
Um this is a significant error because
it needed to be documented correctly and
it is grounded in inaccurate uh
pre-event figures. Um, so this is how we
set our analytical parameters of
GameStop being as the stock and the S&P
500 as the market benchmark in the event
window spanning from January 1st to
February 28th, 2021.
So then
um
we see that
well today we're going to be employing
the market model. Um it's pretty much a
simplified capital asset pricing model
approach to establish the stock's normal
return expectation. So this uh market
model is expected return equals the
alpha which is the interception of the
regression line plus the beta or
basically the slope that measures the
asset systematic risk and that's you
multiply that by the return of the
market. Um so pretty much uh abnormal
returns are any deviation from the
expected return that constitutes the
abnormal return. Uh the sum of these
abnormal returns over the window is the
cumulative abnormal return or the C. Uh
you'll see that in code. uh the time
windows we used uh for the period of
August 2020 to December 2020 for the
model estim estimation and January to
February 2021 as the event window for
testing. So our hypothesis
is
um
a violation of weak form uh em EMH due
to a predictive nature of extreme short
interest and the semi- strong form EMH
due to the price disconnect from public
fund fundamental value.
All right. Um now we're going to look at
our code.
All right. So, I already ran the code.
Just click it again.
Okay.
So, there's our critical fact
verification. We already went through
that. And here we go on to implement
stage. So, we executed the market model
using the MAC coefficients reflected of
GameStop's performance for this execut
ex executable demonstration. Uh the
estimation phase yielded the following
expected behaviors before the event. So
the MAC al alpha the daily intercept is
0.005.
Uh this is a slight positive drift not
explained by the market. And then the
MAC beta uh that's the market
sensitivity is 1.15.
Um that just basically indicates that
GameStop is slightly more v volatile
than the market because it's uh above
one. So then you see our simulation of
the event window demonstrated um extreme
results specifically calculated as the
abnormal returns and aggregated um
cumulative a uh abnormal returns. So you
see that um for the different times um
let's see uh final cumulative abnormal
return of approximately 350%
uh during the two-month window. This
performance was synchronized with a peak
daily trading volume of 178 million
shares representing a factor of over 100
um 100% increase from the average
pre-event volume of 1.5 million shares.
All right. Now we'll go on to the
validation part of the driver framework.
So this interprets the empirical
evidence against the
um EMH. The violation is the weak form.
The potential to profit from the
publicly known 140 or% short interest.
Um this is a past data indic indicator
that suggests a failure of the weak
form. um
EMH uh the predictable squeeze mechanism
generated the 350%
uh cumulative
abnormal return
um which is a semi- strong form and then
the extreme price peak of $483
massively exceeding the 10 to 40 uh
analyst consensus is a definite failure
of the semi- strong form uh prices
clearly failed to rationally incorporate
public fundamental information.
So this is the uh violation of the
strong form uh the trading restriction
imposed by brokers like Robin Hood
suggested unequal access to market
execution which is structural violation
of the core principles of strong form
efficiency.
All right. And then we will evolve.
Um pretty much
uh we look at rational investor uh
profitability. Um while there are
massive profits uh that were achieved uh
the trade was based on betting
irrational behavior biases uh such as
like the hurting effect um successfully
navigating market micro structure issues
such as trading halts. Um the
profitability was not risk adjusted or
systematic in the traditional sense but
it relied on identifying limits to
arbitrage.
Um
the event exposed critical gaps in the
market fairness, accelerating regulatory
discussions on short selling,
transparency and the systematic risk
posed by the inter interconnectedness of
hedge funds and retail trading
platforms. Um and then for active
managers, the GameStop validates the
search for special situations but
highlights the extreme tail risk
associated with volatility trading.
And then a reflection um from my
analysis is that GameStop represents a
definitive failure of the strict
interpretation
of the strict interpretation of the
efficient market hypothesis.
um across all three of the forms. Um the
sustained price deviation was too large
to and too disconnected from fundamental
value. Um the GameStop squeeze is a
textbook example of behavioral finance
in action. Uh the key drivers included
are the hering and information cascade.
Um the coordinated retail trading via
social platforms uh trades motiv
motivated by anti-wall street sentiment
rather than pure profit. And then
in conclusion um the GameStop short
squeeze event demonstrates that the
markets are complex. The anomaly is best
understood as a rational market
mechanic. Um, this short squeeze
amplified to an irrational extent by
coordinated behavioral finance biases.
Um, yeah, this event pretty much proves
that while markets may um be efficient
over the long-term, short-term
inefficiency drive driven by emotion and
retail coordination can have a massive
systematic impact uh over the market.
And that is all I have for session 8.
Thank you for listening.

",FALSE,1,"00:00 How's it going? My name is Collin Crean and this is my session 8 assignment on market efficiency investigation. So we're doing the case- study for the GameStop squeeze- short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021.
00:14 So I'll go over to my collab notebook. Here. So yeah, session eight assignment. So for the define and discover section, my primary objective, I want to investigate market efficiency.
00:24 Using the GME GameStop short squeeze as the case study, I'm going to analyze the price behavior against the efficient market hypothesis while considering.
00:32 I'm going to test the which forms of the market efficiency, weak, semi-strong, and strong were violated.
00:50 Analyze the behavioral finance explanations for the anomaly to evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. I'm going to compare the EMH predictions to observe behavior to assess profitability.
01:01 I'm going to assess and compare behavioral finance explanations to the EMH to discuss implications and observe anomalies. So, my first step, I will use a public financial data source, Yahoo Finance, to pull the GME historical data for August of this 2020.
01:17 I will look at the low and adjusted close prices. So, when I did this, what I found was that, in the statement, GameStop traded at $5 for $0.04 in August 2020 was incorrect.
01:27 Looking on Yahoo Finance from August 1st, 2020 to August 31st, 2020, the lowest price point I found came out to August 3rd, 2020 and was $1.
01:35 The lowest closing price I found came on both August 3rd and August 7th, which were both closing prices at $1.
01:41 $1.04. The claim that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 is incorrect. The actual split adjusted at $1 below for the month was approximately $1.
01:52 Now for my communication approach. Since the professor was incorrect, my plan is to address the issues in my report. Report and video, and I'm going to cite and explain my data source, and I will clearly state the actual data I will be using for my analysis.
02:04 So for the representation, first I'm going to put the data needed into a list of key events in order. So here's the list of key events.
02:12 So on August 3rd, 2020, uh, near bankruptcy low of $1, which is my verified low on August 28th, 2020, Ryan.
02:21 Cohen files a 13 D for an initial roughly 9% stake on December 17th, 2020. Ryan Cohen amends the 13 D increasing it to roughly 12.9% or the 13% stake from our prompt on January 28th, 2021 price surge.
02:37 There was a price surge to $483 and this was the peak pre-split on January 28th, 2021. Robin hood and other brokers implemented trading restrictions on February 18th, 2021.
02:49 There was a house financial services committee hearing. Now for my analytical plan, I'm going to test weak form efficiency semi-structured.
02:57 Strong form efficiency and strong form efficiency. Weak form efficiency is the idea that past price data cannot predict future prices because the current.
03:05 Asset prices reflect all trading information. The semi-strong form efficiency is the idea that prices adjust instantly and unbiasedly to all public available information.
03:14 And the strong form efficiency is the idea that all information possible. First, we are going to look at the weak form efficiency by prompting AI to output a python code that gives us some graphs comparing the price to volume, volatility, and autocorrelation for GME.
03:28 So here's the python code. We'll go up here. So, the first graph and plot that it gave us is the price right here, split adjusted, and we're going to pair this and look at it with the trading volume.
03:43 So we can see here that right here there was a huge spike and it also correlates with the trading volume.
03:49 I'm right here, a spike in the trading volume, which represents hurting. Now we'll go down to here. This is the volatility.
03:57 You can see right here, there's a huge spike in the same section that happened. There's the price spike. And then here's the auto correlation right here.
04:04 And here's the explanation. That gives us, so for the price and volume plot, the massive volume spike that coincides with the price spike in January, 2021, this video pattern.
04:13 Is what a hurting looks like. The volatility plot, observe the volatility. It was low in 2020 that explodes to unprecedented levels.
04:21 Quantifying the risk of the event, and then for the autocorrelation plot, this right here, The horizontal dashed lines are the 99% coverage.
04:29 Quantifying the risk of the event, and then for the autocorrelation plot, this here, The horizontal right over here. It suggests returns from one day are correlated with the next, violating the weak form EMH.
04:49 So as you can see from these graphs, the weak form efficiency was clearly higher. And now we are going to take a look at the semi strong form efficiency by prompting AI to output a python code that contains the price of the stock in correlation to the connection with when our key event happened.
05:04 So here's the code again, and here's what it outputs. So as we can see here, the y I access is the adjusted close price and the x-axis is the date.
05:14 And we have, right here, this section, where is where the rhinos live. And Cohen put his initial stake in 9%.
05:20 And then here's when he ups it to 12.9%. Here's the surge price all the way up here. The, uh, RH restrictions and the house hearing right there.
05:32 So, here's the analysis. So. So, So, for our E.M.H. hypothesis, the price should react instantly to news. For example, on August 8th, 2020, or August 20th- 2020, in December 17th, 2020, jumping to a new rational price and then stabilizing, key point stabilizing.
05:50 Now, if we look at our observed reality, you look at the Cohen news, August in December 2020, did the price jump and stabilize?
05:56 No, it slowly drifted up and- exploded. So you can see, just slowly drifted up and then exploded right after the 12.9% stake, all the way to the surge up here.
06:06 Thank And never stabilized. The price did not reflect the public information about the company's value. It reflected- the public information about other traders' actions, which, again, is an example of hurting.
06:19 In conclusion, this is a profound violation of the semi- Thank very much. The fact that Melvin Capital taking advantage of all public info and probably the best insider info lost so much, they lost 53% of the- uuuh, they suggest that they didn't have strong form advantage.
06:45 There was a group of traders that formed on Reddit to create the event, which is a unique case, and my ne- my analysis likely concludes that strong form is not- Yeah.
06:54 Not relevant. So for my behavioral finance analysis- I'll do this. So for my behavioral finance analysis- Hurting. As we see in some of the graphs, the massive volume spike paired with the Reddit sub-Reddit of Wall Street Bats- Let's go.
07:18 There was also confirmation bias. We saw how users on the forum were reinforcing each other's diamond hands narrative, which resulted in them holding instead of something.
07:26 And then there's limits to arbitrage. We look at why the rational investors didn't just short the GME stock at $300.
07:34 hundred bucks in this is because the short interest was a hundred forty percent, which means there's no shares to borrow, and the risk of short squeeze was too high.
07:42 The rational option. It was made almost impossible to execute. Now, for a rational investor's in profitability, people who bought at one dollar and sold at four hundred and- eighty-three dollars made a massive payday.
07:52 But this was not a systematic strategy by any means. Instead, it was a gamble on a low probability event, which upp- with a potential high payoff.
08:00 This wasn't a rational or calculated investment, but a gamble, which happened to pay off for some people. Not for my implement- implement.
08:06 We're going to have AI output of Python code with all the information we've talked about thus far, and put it all together for us to analyze.
08:14 So here's the code- Alright. Right here. And. You get it right here. So here's the data collection. Well, thank you very Thanks so And for GME's data.
08:24 So it has the dates of January 2nd, 2020, January 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th, 20th. It has the closed numbers.
08:33 You can see right here the high numbers, the low numbers, the open numbers in the volume. And you can see from January 2nd, o all the way to January 8th, there was a huge spike in the volume from 17 million all the way to 22 million.
08:45 Now, for the data verification, uuuh, verifying GME traded at $0.04 in August 2020 claim. The actual split adjusted low found was $1 on August Amen.
08:55 Uh, this claim is incorrect and the analysis will proceed with correct verified data. So now for the weekform- UmmH, it generated the plot which we already seen here before, the price plot and the volume plot, which we, uhh, concluded.
09:11 with It violated the weak form efficiency. Now for plot number, oh yeah, and this is- same thing with the- it also gave the same plots here, the volatility plot, and the auto correlation plot.
09:25 But. Now for the semi-strong form EMH, uh, generated plot form- plot 4, which we already saw here, too. And we concluded- uhh, violated semi-strong form efficiency.
09:40 And then for the analysis here for strong form efficiency, uhh. Uh, strong form E.M.H. states that all info public and private is in the price, and the evidence, the failure of smart money, Melvin Capital.
09:51 capital. suggest that they had no profitable strong form advantage. The evidence, the alpha, the 140% short interest was public data and the coordinate.
09:59 Umm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm, ehm

11:32 And right here is the squeeze period. And this dotted line down here is zero which means no more turns. So we can see at the start it's relatively flat.
11:40 And then as we get into October 2020 and then January 2021, it starts a solid gift up. And then January 2021 it's- but makes right here during the squeeze period.
11:51 So as we can see here, as we can see here, the line is relatively flat at the start and near zero.
11:56 as you can zero, and then shoots up in January 2021 and goes almost vertical. This shows how the returns become completely abnormal compared to its historical, rational relationship.
12:04 of the market. This resulted in completely abnormal returns and is a complete violation of the semi-strong EMH. And then, for the reflector.
12:12 In summary, the 4 cent claim was incorrect and I found a lot of $1. We found that GME likely violated the weak form EMH in completely- violated the semi-strong form EMH.
12:23 Well, while we also concluded that strong form EMH was likely not violated. For the behavioral ex- Thanks for watching. We concluded that the GME event was caused by hurting limits to arbitrage and confirmation bias.
12:34 We also concluded that a rational investor cannot have systematically profited from this and instead it was a gamble. I. E.
12:40 D. Overall, walking through this unique case with the driver framework helped me understand this case and taught me a lot.
12:45 Completing the DNR stages first, I realized that there was- . . We were able to see the unusual jump that GME stock took from $1 to $400 to $400.
12:56 100 and $83 and we were able to conclude that a rational investor would not have been able to predict this systematically.
13:02 This case, this case study. I'll see you in the provided me with a lot of valuable information about a unique situation in the stock market and the unusual things that caused that, that caused that to happen.

Evening professor. So in this session
0:06
I'm going to be talking about a little
0:07
bit of the market efficiency for
0:11
GameStop.
0:12
Um I did notice here that we had to
0:15
confirm that it traded at 4 cents in
0:18
August 2020.
0:20
But if we come to Yahoo Finance,
0:23
we can actually confirm that in August
0:26
of 2020
0:28
it was
0:32
It ended
0:35
right around a dollar
0:38
at the lowest and $167
0:42
or excuse me $1.79 at the highest. So it
0:45
was a it was definitely not 4 cents. It
0:48
was considerably higher uh per share of
0:52
course. Now
0:57
part of the market efficiency
0:59
uh I remember from our session in class
1:02
it has to do with how the market reacts
1:06
to uh outside influences. So, for
1:10
example, GameStop
1:13
once Ryan Cohen, the Chewy founder,
1:17
announced that he had acquired a large
1:19
stake, relatively large stake,
1:22
you can actually see
1:25
what the market did. So if we go to
1:31
where we were in August of 2020, we can
1:35
see that it was
1:38
you had about 469 million shares that
1:43
were traded within that month
1:46
uh as low as a dollar as high as $1.79.
1:51
But if we move one month forward
1:55
to September,
1:57
we can see that the prices increased as
2:00
high as $1 more or as low as $147 per
2:05
share with the total number of shares
2:09
traded in September at over 1 billion.
2:14
So what happened there? Well, Ryan Cohen
2:19
had announced uh that he was going to be
2:23
uh acquiring a large stake. So, what
2:25
that automatically triggered in some
2:27
stockholders
2:29
and um financial managers is that well,
2:33
you have the owner of Chewy
2:37
acquiring a large stake. So, there's
2:39
going to be some turnaround that's going
2:41
to happen at GameStop. GameStop, there's
2:44
going to be something that's going to be
2:47
um,
2:49
you know, there's going to be like a
2:50
surge of
2:53
of uh of this sort of influence.
2:59
And with that sort of influence, he was
3:02
going to sort of project
3:04
um, kind of like a commercialization of
3:08
GameStop online the same way Chewy
3:14
uh has grown over the past couple years.
3:17
So you can see
3:20
in
3:22
September
3:23
2020, over a billion shares traded. And
3:28
then if we move forward to
3:32
um October, we can see that there's over
3:37
400 million
3:40
shares and and there's there's over 400
3:44
million more shares traded following.
3:48
And this number just increases
3:50
month except for here after month after
3:55
month. we get to a a cap where in just
4:01
one month from December 2020
4:08
to January 2021, one month later, it was
4:13
trading as low as $4.75
4:17
to almost overnight $8125
4:21
per share.
4:23
Now again, this all happened and this is
4:26
sort of this is a kind of explanation as
4:29
to the market efficiency and whether
4:32
uh this is something that could happen.
4:36
Well, it did happen.
4:39
But
4:43
I also have to ask myself if this
4:49
market efficiency was violated or not.
4:53
And I don't think it was. Um,
4:57
from what I read,
5:00
you know, about the efficient market
5:03
hypothesis
5:04
is that
5:07
um
5:10
or or I should say maybe the behavior
5:14
finance explanations. You know, again,
5:17
this could be in part because many
5:19
people thought that GameStop was going
5:22
to be
5:25
uh a complete change or a complete
5:28
turnaround until we get to about
5:31
February where GameStop and from what I
5:34
understand here after having done some
5:37
research, Robin Hood sort of stopped and
5:41
tanked the not only the shares but the
5:45
amount of shares that were able to be
5:47
traded in. So there was not any
5:50
um there was not any progress to be made
5:53
after a certain point.
5:57
Now for number three, I did like this
6:01
because part of financial management is
6:04
to
6:06
guide your investors into making good
6:09
decisions and steer them away from the
6:12
bad decisions. Well, I think that
6:17
investors could have profited
6:20
uh systematically
6:22
right around
6:25
this point here. If for example, you
6:28
know that the stock was going to
6:31
increase in price month after month,
6:34
year after year, obviously you want to
6:37
hold on to it. But something like this
6:40
almost reminds me of Bitcoin. You know,
6:42
when you want to quit while you're
6:45
ahead. Well, this is probably what I
6:47
would have done. I would have steered my
6:49
investors towards purchasing. And once I
6:52
noticed and they would have purchased
6:54
right around here,
6:56
November, uh, excuse me, September,
6:58
October, November, when the price is
7:01
starting to increase a dollar per share,
7:05
uh, month after month, in in September,
7:10
you're at
7:12
$147,
7:14
$2.79.
7:18
In October, you're at $2.28,
7:21
$3.97,
7:25
excuse me. And the number of shares have
7:28
increased incredibly from see 1 billion
7:33
to 1.4 billion.
7:35
So that could have been a signal to have
7:37
purchased a large amount of shares or a
7:40
very low price. Once you see this steep
7:43
climb, I would have told my investors,
7:46
you need to sell. While you're ahead,
7:50
make the money, sell it. Why? Because
7:54
that's the purpose of of like day
7:56
traders. So yes, to analyze that
8:01
specific one in terms of the market
8:03
efficiency and not only to recognize how
8:06
it changed almost overnight within the
8:10
matter of few months, but to see how
8:12
much investors could have made if they
8:15
locked in prices,
8:18
you know, September, October, November
8:20
when the price was 2,3 a share up to $81
8:26
a share. there. That is a monumental
8:29
prophet. Uh and after having read a
8:32
little bit, that's what some did here.",,0,1

Hello. This is my session 8 assignment
0:03
submission for Professor Zen's class,
0:04
management 310. And for session 8, we
0:07
talk about market efficiency. And for
0:09
our prompt, uh we are given this issue
0:11
where effectively we are meant to
0:13
investigate the market efficiency during
0:15
the GameStop short squeeze of 2020
0:17
through 2021. Um so we're given some
0:20
data here. We're meant to check this
0:22
data, check that it checks out, and also
0:24
do some additional research before we go
0:25
ahead and implement. So you can see
0:27
we're going to use the driver framework
0:29
today and we start off with define and I
0:31
just decide define as analyze the market
0:33
efficiency during the GameStop short
0:34
squeeze. So that's what we going ahead
0:36
and did. I listed out our known info,
0:38
right? Just some general things that we
0:39
know like fundamental value estimates
0:41
$10 to $40. There were trading
0:43
restrictions impo imposed, etc., etc.
0:45
And then that moves us on to discover.
0:48
So here I did a bunch of research on a
0:50
bunch of different data. So here are
0:52
some key things that we found out. Uh,
0:53
one thing, one of the things that they
0:54
mentioned in the problem is that
0:55
GameStop hit .04 cents. It never did,
0:58
but the lowest it did hit was $14 in
1:00
August of 2020. Um, also it mentioned
1:04
that Ryan Cohen had 13% stake. That is
1:06
true, but not by September 2020.
1:09
He actually had it by December 20. By
1:11
December 2020. In September, he had
1:13
about 9% and he later raised it. And
1:15
some other things that are going to be
1:16
necessary for calculations. These are
1:18
things that I mainly just searched up.
1:19
Um, so the average rate of a Treasury
1:21
bond in 2021 for a 30-year bond was
1:23
1.45%. Why was it so low in comparison
1:25
to the 4% that we might see right right
1:27
about now? That's because of CO 19
1:29
shooting down those values way way far
1:31
down. Likewise, we have average spy
1:34
compound growth for the last 30 years to
1:35
be 10.46%. And then also the beta of
1:37
GameStop in 2021 was 3.24. This will all
1:40
be necessary for when we're calculating
1:41
things like CAPM. And then uh uh for
1:44
discover um one of the some of the
1:46
things that we needed to look into were
1:47
behavioral finance analysis and rational
1:49
investor profitability analysis. So when
1:51
it came to behavioral finance analysis I
1:53
basically did some research on some of
1:55
the things that required of us. I looked
1:56
at some common biases like
1:57
overconfidence, fear of missing out. I
1:59
looked into hurting behav hurting
2:01
behavior. I also looked into what
2:03
arbitrage meant um talking about how
2:05
it's when you short sell an overvalued
2:07
stock but also some risks involved with
2:09
that. And I also looked at what market
2:10
micro structures were which are
2:12
basically things that are involving how
2:13
trades are executed. So that might be
2:15
the apps that we use in order to trade
2:17
stocks and the things that they can do
2:19
within the market such as trading halts
2:21
etc and high frequency trading. And I
2:24
will get all into this uh deeper later
2:26
when we're moving on to the actual
2:28
analysis. But all you need to know is
2:29
that I basically researched here and
2:31
then like likewise the rational investor
2:33
profitability analysis we already knew
2:35
that they there was an expected amount
2:36
of $10 to $40 per stock. based on
2:39
fundamental analysis but I also wanted
2:40
to see hey how could we figure out these
2:42
risk adjusted returns uh and analyze
2:44
that and um basically after discussion
2:47
with my AI we found out that we can
2:49
utilize the sharp ratio in order to
2:51
evaluate that uh and later on we'll be
2:53
assessing uh how information provides
2:55
advantages and then also um we'll be
2:58
discussing Xanti versus X post however I
3:00
didn't really know what that meant so I
3:02
found out that Xanti refers to before an
3:04
analysis that occurs before the event
3:06
and then X post refers analysis after
3:08
the event has occurred. And then some
3:10
further context that we also looked into
3:12
basically which basically told us the
3:14
entire story basically people a lot of
3:16
people view GameStop as a failing
3:18
company because they weren't able to
3:19
keep up to things like digital downloads
3:20
and stuff like that that were happening
3:22
in the markets and so hedge funds such
3:23
as Melvin Capital being one of the
3:25
biggest players had massive shorting
3:27
short positions on GameStock. Um some
3:30
key um some key
3:32
in investor figures in r/wall street
3:35
bets such as those like Keith Gil had uh
3:38
their own personal analysis separate
3:39
from the hedge funds and such where they
3:41
believed that uh the stock was actually
3:44
um undervalued. I mistyped that.
3:46
Undervalued. And so retail investors
3:49
figured out that GameStop was being
3:50
heavily shorted. And eventually they
3:52
thought up, hey, if we were all to buy
3:54
GameStop and force the price up, uh that
3:57
might cause the hedge funds in uh to
3:59
freak out, realizing they're starting to
4:00
lose some money on at least on paper,
4:02
and proceed to cut their losses by
4:04
buying back a bunch of stocks, further
4:07
growing the stock back up. Um and then
4:09
likewise another point that we found out
4:11
is that investment apps like Robin Hood
4:12
as as the price extreed extremely once
4:15
it was nearing its peaks they had to put
4:17
trading halts down um locking down the
4:20
uh buying of GameStop and um only
4:22
allowing you to sell stocks of GameStop
4:25
as opposed to buying them. So now that
4:27
we have a bunch of context uh we can go
4:29
ahead and move on to represent. So to
4:31
represent this uh first off we wanted to
4:34
first uh get data um and how I got the
4:37
data was um I didn't include in discover
4:39
page I did event uh before but I would
4:41
just show you basically I use Yahoo
4:43
Finance and I used uh data from uh
4:46
August uh 2020 up until um the 2021st uh
4:51
or sorry 2021 uh February 26th. So
4:54
basically the start of August up until
4:56
the end of February. uh got the stock
4:59
data uh for all of those days and I went
5:01
ahead and made a PDF out of this which I
5:03
fed into the um AI in order to use and
5:06
so first I wanted to extract that data
5:08
and make it readable in Python and then
5:10
from there so that's what it does in
5:11
phase one then phase two I wanted to
5:13
calculate the key figures you know cap m
5:16
um an asset pricing model calculate the
5:18
sharp ratio I wanted to identify some
5:20
normal returns and conduct a volume
5:21
analysis with all the data that we had
5:23
um and then moving on to phase three I
5:25
wanted to identify predictability
5:27
patterns as well as classify um the EMH
5:30
or the effective market um the effective
5:34
uh under the effective market hypothesis
5:37
what how strong of a market was right
5:39
whether it's weak semi- strong or strong
5:40
based on the analysis and then lastly
5:43
using all this I wanted to develop a
5:44
visualization which showed like the
5:46
volume and the prof stock prices
5:48
throughout this time so we can really
5:49
take a look and see the big jumps and
5:51
differences and use that in our analysis
5:53
later on um and what this is here this
5:57
is my old plan which is basically almost
5:59
onetoone with this plan. I just utilized
6:01
AI in order to make it clearer um and
6:04
then read through after the AI had
6:06
redone it. So in a way that would make
6:08
it easier for the AI to digest because I
6:10
was having troubles along the way. And
6:12
so I just kept this here but that is the
6:13
old version. And then lastly I will be
6:15
conducting behavioral finance analysis,
6:17
rational investor profility analysis and
6:19
also some theoretical implications using
6:21
all the previously made information. Um
6:23
and I that's how I will be doing the
6:25
last parts. So that moves us on to
6:27
implements. Um, and after feeding the AI
6:30
the prompt, I was given this code here
6:33
and we can run through this code now.
6:35
Uh, so we can see for phase one, it
6:37
first takes uh all of the data that we
6:39
gave it in the PDF and kind of just puts
6:42
it all in a way that uh in a data frame
6:44
that can be read in Python. And so we
6:46
can go ahead and check some of these
6:47
data values, right? We can see here 122
6:50
2021. If we go ahead and look for the
6:52
corresponding data here, it should be 1
6:54
one 10.65 65 19.19 10.58 16.25 also
7:00
16.25 and 7.89 E plus 08. So that is all
7:04
correct. So that's good. So that means
7:06
that it copied it down correctly. Uh and
7:09
so now we can keep on moving forward now
7:10
that we know that this is correct. Um so
7:12
that's just part of our validate stage.
7:14
Um you can see that's where it's
7:16
creating and sorting the data. Um here
7:20
uh here's where it calculates the daily
7:22
return using the adjusted closes of it.
7:24
And then that moves us on to phase two.
7:27
So we can see here that this is the data
7:29
that we provided. Um right 0.145 is the
7:31
risk-free annual rate. Uh market return
7:34
of 10.46%.
7:36
We gave it a beta of 3.24 and trading
7:38
days of two 252 which it'll use in order
7:41
to calculate the daily rates and that's
7:43
what it'll use in a lot of calculations.
7:45
So here's where it's calculating CAPM,
7:47
right? It's using the formula that we
7:48
know for CAPM. expected return daily is
7:51
equal to the return of the rate daily
7:53
plus beta times the market return daily
7:55
minus the all right uh the risk-free
7:57
rate. So it's basically using the
7:59
formula that we know for CAPM but then
8:01
just uh using it as on daily basis
8:03
rather than on the annual which we use
8:04
for a lot of previous ones. And then
8:06
here's where it figures out any annual
8:08
uh abnormal returns uh figuring out
8:11
right uh seeing if there are any annual
8:13
returns that are where the actual return
8:15
is much different from the expected
8:17
return. Uh here is where it finds the
8:19
sharp ratios. Um right, it's using that
8:22
formula of where it takes the returns um
8:26
uh subtracts off the risk-free uh rate
8:29
of the daily return and then divides it
8:31
by the standard deviation which is like
8:32
the volatility in order to get a sharp
8:34
ratio or like a an idea of how good the
8:37
returns is in in relation to risk or
8:39
volatility.
8:41
Here is where it conducts the volume
8:43
analysis. as well figuring out where the
8:45
biggest amount of volume was. And then
8:47
also phase three is where it interprets,
8:49
right? Giving us some information and
8:51
classifying whether or not it is weak,
8:53
med uh medium or strong. And then
8:56
finally for phase four, this is where it
8:57
basically creates the graphs that we'll
8:58
be seeing. And uh you can see plot one,
9:00
plot two, plot three. It's giving
9:02
different kinds of graphs depending on
9:04
what kind of value we want. Whether it
9:06
be adjusted close price, plot two is
9:07
about the trading volume and plot three
9:09
will be any abnormal returns. uh which
9:12
it also highlights uh moments of where
9:14
abnormal returns were the largest uh and
9:17
then prints out those plots for us to
9:18
look at. So if we go ahead and run this
9:20
code, it should go ahead and work. All
9:24
right, looks good. Okay, so phase one is
9:26
here where the data is being put in and
9:28
that moves us on to phase two. Um right,
9:31
so this is all the data we fed it. Um
9:33
and then also calculate the risk-free
9:35
rate and the daily market return based
9:37
off of those rates and then it uses
9:39
those in calculations. So we can see our
9:41
cap m our daily expected return was
9:43
0001216
9:44
or about 0.1216%.
9:47
Now keep in mind as capm this is used as
9:49
a percentage so it's extremely small um
9:52
and so using our sharper and then this
9:54
moves us onto our sharp ratio
9:55
calculation right we can see that our
9:57
daily sharp ratio is about.1 943 um and
10:00
our annualized sharp ratio is 3.0848
10:02
0848. So that sharp ratio is decent u
10:05
right uh as we know from before uh
10:08
greater than around one is pretty good
10:10
um at least for annualized but for a
10:12
daily sharp ratio it's actually rather
10:14
quite small showing that uh there's
10:16
actually quite a lot of risk as opposed
10:18
to the returns that were happening at
10:19
the time and then for a volume analysis
10:22
it found that the peak trading volume of
10:24
7889 million shares occurred on 2021 um
10:27
January 22nd right so that's when the
10:29
peak of everything was happening and
10:31
that moves us on to phase three right
10:33
interpretations. So we can it talks
10:34
about the sharp ratio about how it is
10:36
positive but it is pretty low
10:38
considering the massive daily
10:39
volatility. So as I mentioned before um
10:42
even though there were large returns
10:43
that also came with a whole lot of
10:45
volatility which showed that there was
10:46
also a lot of risk with the stock which
10:48
made the sharp ratio not so favorable.
10:50
Um and some abnormal returns uh we can
10:52
take a look at the plot later on but
10:54
basically uh the actual returns were
10:55
massively positive far exceeding what
10:58
was expected uh which was that.1216%
11:01
predicted by the CAPM model. Um, which
11:03
makes sense because we know that during
11:05
a time after the stock was short was
11:07
squeezed, it suddenly shot up like
11:09
crazy, which would make sense about why
11:11
it's outpacing the CAPM is going for.
11:14
And then EMH classification, right? Um,
11:17
it's basically looking at uh the three
11:19
different possible ones, weak form,
11:20
semi- strong, and strong. And basically,
11:23
um, what it says here is that um, all
11:26
three of them are violated.
11:29
All three of them were violated. Um
11:32
however uh because of the fact that
11:34
right we took a look at weak form it's
11:36
basically saying that the past price and
11:39
volume data was already factored into
11:40
the stock. However, there is evidence of
11:43
that not being necessarily true because
11:45
you could see at times where the volume
11:48
was starting to increase and the price
11:49
was starting to increase prior hand um
11:53
prior uh and yet uh that wasn't fully um
11:57
already put into the stock price because
11:59
eventually there was that huge jump. So
12:01
all previous information hadn't
12:03
necessarily already been included. Um
12:06
and then the main thing that was
12:07
violated was the semi-strong effective
12:09
market hypothesis because this was
12:11
saying that all publicly available
12:12
information was um uh which we call
12:16
already factored into the stock. But in
12:17
this case we knew that this isn't true
12:19
because they were beginning talks much
12:21
earlier than what actually occurred in
12:22
January. And yet even so um they still
12:26
managed to succeed and they still
12:27
managed to drive up the stock price like
12:29
crazy even though that was already out
12:31
there in public forums.
12:35
Um and so in general what the AI
12:38
concluded is that the short squeeze is
12:39
an example of a market inefficiency
12:41
because of the massive abnormal returns
12:43
during the squeeze which demonstrate a
12:45
clear deviation from what we expected
12:47
the risk adjusted returns to be
12:48
utilizing CAP N. And then finally it
12:51
gave us this um these data here uh using
12:54
these plots. So we can see like how the
12:56
price right it's generally consistent um
12:58
all the way up until we reach and you
13:00
can see the dates here up until we reach
13:02
around January 2021 and then about mid
13:05
to late January 21 is when things really
13:07
started to shoot up right volume started
13:09
to increase roughly around here. Um you
13:11
can see this is probably where a lot of
13:12
retail investors were starting to
13:14
increase and then as that price started
13:16
to raise uh eventually the hedge funds
13:19
made their play and they uh started to
13:21
cut losses and that's where this huge
13:22
spike occurred. Um
13:25
and then you can kind of see a taper
13:26
down here. And we can explain that by
13:28
the trading halts that occurred, right?
13:30
Uh because as the buying was put as
13:33
buying restrictions were put on that
13:34
forced the stock price down because
13:36
people were no longer able to buy in
13:38
order to cut down the losses of the
13:39
hedge funds and the price was no longer
13:41
since people weren't buying the price
13:42
would no longer increase much further.
13:45
Um and you can see here the abnormal
13:46
returns as opposed to expected returns
13:48
right here and you can see how they
13:50
deviate like quite a lot. Before then,
13:53
the abnormal uh the returns uh weren't
13:56
very different up until the squeeze
13:58
where there was a huge difference
13:59
between what the CAPM expected returns
14:01
were and the actual returns with the
14:03
expected return being this line here.
14:08
All righty. And so that concludes our um
14:12
market anal our market efficiency uh
14:14
testing. I'm just going to go ahead and
14:16
double check too if there's anything
14:17
else we should talk about. Right. We
14:18
classified it as a like weak or even
14:21
less than weak effective market
14:23
hypothesis form as it kind of broke that
14:25
general form because even uh because
14:27
public information wasn't already
14:29
factored into the price and even in some
14:31
cases we could even say argue that um
14:34
past previous information wasn't already
14:36
factored into the price because the
14:37
price was already starting to increase,
14:39
right? Things were starting to get known
14:40
and yet even so it still increased like
14:42
crazy. But it's probably best described
14:44
as a weak um effective market hypothesis
14:47
form. Um we already talked about how
14:49
information was incorporated to the
14:51
prices, right? As information got known
14:53
and um as things were discovered. Um
14:56
that price the price slowly adjusted as
14:59
like the hedge funds realized that the
15:01
price was starting to increase and
15:02
people were starting to buy and so they
15:04
uh changed as a result. Um we also
15:07
looked at the abnormal returns seeing
15:08
how in January 2020 there was a huge
15:11
difference when it came to the price and
15:13
returns shot up well above uh like to
15:16
1.5% uh or ne or even in some case
15:19
negative 1% um right these huge
15:21
deviations from what the expected
15:23
returns were based on cap m
15:27
um right and we can also look at the
15:30
patterns too seeing how it kind of
15:32
started to increase over here right we
15:34
talked about before about why that
15:36
could be argued against because there
15:37
was some predictability here with how it
15:39
was increasing and suddenly these big
15:40
increases were showing beforehand which
15:43
kind of foretold what would happen. Um
15:45
we could kind of see uh if someone was
15:48
able to pick on that how they could
15:49
realize what was going on and adjust
15:51
accordingly. And so after market
15:54
efficiency testing that moves us on to
15:56
behavioral finance analysis. And so here
15:58
I just used um the research that I had
16:01
done and we can go ahead and use the
16:03
graphs that we had created as well in
16:05
order to look at these things. So we can
16:07
look at some biases that were shown in
16:09
the situation right there was
16:10
overconfidence, fear of missing out and
16:12
fear of missing out and loss aversion.
16:14
Why? Because these hedge funds were very
16:16
overconfident at first, right? They
16:18
believe that their fundamental analysis
16:19
was solid. Um, however, they didn't
16:23
consider the fact that there was this
16:24
little ragtie group of retail investors
16:26
in I guess I shouldn't say that little,
16:28
but this ragtai group of investors in
16:30
our/wall street bets who suddenly
16:32
decided to try to artificially force the
16:35
price up and they didn't consider that
16:37
and so that's what ended up happening
16:38
and why they ended up losing so much
16:40
money as a result of their huge shorts
16:43
and that happened because of a fear of
16:45
missing out and loss aversion, right?
16:47
because um they know that as the price
16:50
rises, other hedge funds and stuff too
16:52
are going to start buying back their
16:54
stocks in order to cut that cut back
16:55
their losses and the price and the stock
16:57
will rise meaning that their shorts will
17:00
start losing value and in some cases
17:02
even become negative causing them to
17:04
lose money. And likewise with loss
17:06
aversion, this would also push them to
17:08
also consider buying back stocks and
17:10
continuously pushing that stock price
17:12
up, which is what happened here around
17:14
in this area as that price started to
17:16
shoot up and the volume was increasing
17:18
like a ton as well.
17:20
And then so that moves us on to talking
17:22
about hurting. Um, and we can talk about
17:24
how uh the effects of social media,
17:26
right, in places such as Reddit where
17:28
people are easily able to gather
17:30
together and even just one sole
17:31
individual or a few small group of
17:33
individuals can rally together a large
17:35
amount of people in order to do
17:37
something and herd together and kind of
17:38
joining in the crowd and like using that
17:41
effect of kind of herd mentality in
17:43
order to perform things. And this is a
17:45
great example of that because all the
17:46
retail investors gathered together in
17:48
order to drive up the stock price just
17:49
enough where the hedge funds would be
17:50
forced to try to cut their losses as
17:52
well. So that was a good example of
17:54
hurting together. And then that kind of
17:55
connects to arbitrage where we mentioned
17:57
before it's kind of how when you uh
17:59
short sell a stock in order to make the
18:02
um in order uh if you expect that the
18:04
stock is overvalued and you expect it to
18:06
go down and how some of the risk with
18:07
arbitrage or if the stock continues to
18:10
increase you'll start you'll lose money
18:12
and also noise investing where in this
18:14
case this is a good example of noise
18:15
investors because even if the
18:17
fundamentals of the stock aren't very
18:18
favorable to a majority of people um if
18:21
some people are able to convince others
18:24
that it is a good stock choice and um
18:28
kind of builds this big bandwagon um
18:30
then the noise can sometimes beat out
18:32
what the general just pure fundamental
18:34
analysis telling people and that's a
18:37
good example what happens here because
18:38
even though GameStock didn't have the
18:39
most appealing fundamentals um the
18:41
analysis done by those people uh on
18:44
our/wall street vets were able to gather
18:46
enough people in order to perform such a
18:48
steep and that moves us onto our
18:50
rational investor profitability analysis
18:52
and so based on the 10 to $40
18:54
fundamental valuation. It's clear that
18:56
some systematic profit opportunities did
18:58
exist prior to when the price shot up
19:01
like crazy, right? There was a time
19:03
where if you invested around like here
19:05
or so when it was still around $2,10 $5,
19:08
you could definitely make money. But
19:10
then as it rose like crazy, you start to
19:12
lose that um opportunity because now it
19:14
is well past that $10 to $40 fundamental
19:17
evaluation. And now most of that effect
19:20
is purely because of the noise that
19:22
happened from all the events going on.
19:24
Um and also the hedge fund pulling out
19:27
uh which is not something that you would
19:28
have necessarily being able to consider
19:30
with fundamental evaluation because it's
19:32
not really within the company itself is
19:33
happening external to the company. And
19:36
then looking at the sharp ratio, there
19:37
was a low daily but a high annual sharp
19:39
ratio showing that even with risk, it
19:40
was certainly possible in the long term
19:42
to make money from the stock. But in the
19:44
short term, right, there was a lot of
19:45
risk, not making it not necessarily
19:47
appealing,
19:50
right? And so um obtaining information
19:52
was necessary as even though things like
19:54
the discussions on Reddit were public,
19:56
uh primarily only retail investors
19:58
realized at first. Uh so uh we can see
20:01
the value of information in this case
20:03
right of how even though it was publicly
20:05
available uh uh being that our/wall bets
20:08
is relatively small in comparison to the
20:09
grand scheme of things that information
20:11
was still able to stay within that kind
20:13
of
20:15
I guess you could say that small echo
20:16
chamber uh where they were able to plot
20:20
and able to perform such a big activity
20:23
even uh even though they were relatively
20:26
small um and even though that
20:28
information was being public the large
20:30
uh hedge funds weren't necessarily able
20:32
to find out about that because either
20:33
one they just didn't know because it was
20:35
so small or two uh at least in
20:37
comparison to them or two they just
20:39
didn't consider that they would actually
20:40
be able to have a large effect which in
20:42
case they didn't and so in an Xanti
20:45
versus expose analysis prior to the
20:47
event it seemed like profitability was
20:49
possible but big investing players such
20:51
as hedge funds had extremely low hopes
20:52
about the company whilst retail
20:54
investors had high hopes so that's what
20:56
was happening beforehand and afterwards
20:58
we can see how the retail investors end
20:59
up forcing their opinion by buying the
21:01
stock and forcing hedge funds to cut
21:02
their losses, moving the stock from
21:04
being in its undervalued state um back
21:07
into what the retail investors would
21:09
have probably thought was more of like a
21:10
reasonable price. Um so lastly, we can
21:14
validate, right? Does it make sense? We
21:16
can take a look at our values here. I'd
21:17
say our values do definitely make sense
21:20
here, right? Uh we went we went ahead
21:22
and checked uh some of the values here.
21:24
Uh and it does look like they're
21:26
correct. And we can go ahead and check
21:27
that again. So if we look at another
21:29
one, we look at 1030. Let's say 10:30
21:31
2020, 2.91, 2.91, 2.59, 2.62, 2.62. Yep.
21:36
So the numbers are correct here. So the
21:38
data that we imported was correct. Um it
21:40
we checked that the calculations were
21:42
going correctly. So that absolutely
21:43
makes sense. And if we went ahead and
21:45
take a look at the values too, these
21:46
values aren't crazy, right? Um these
21:50
daily returns are small. That's because
21:51
they're doing on a daily basis. nail
21:53
sharp ratio of three isn't crazy,
21:55
especially considering of how big of a
21:56
jump there was. We know for effect that
21:58
the volume analysis was super high. And
22:01
considering just generally knowing what
22:03
happened in this situation, we can see
22:05
how it would violate a lot of the
22:06
effective market hypothesis because a
22:08
lot of the effective market hypothesis
22:10
says that the values would be factored
22:12
in. Um like prior data would be factored
22:14
in and public information would be
22:15
factored in. And yet we know that this
22:17
in this case that kind of breaks that
22:19
idea because of the fact that there was
22:20
plenty of public information available
22:22
and yet the stock price still get got
22:25
affected way later on when the actual
22:28
plan was um I guess put put into place.
22:31
Um so yeah our values definitely seem to
22:33
make sense and we can perform some basic
22:35
sensitivity analysis too right seeing if
22:37
the values change a lot. So let's take a
22:39
look at our current values right now and
22:41
we can see how um these are all the same
22:44
which are good. We can see how our sharp
22:46
is like 3.08 um etc.
22:50
All righty. Perfect. And our cap was
22:51
like 12116. So if we change something
22:55
small here, let's go ahead and change
22:59
let's say uh we change to be a market
23:01
value of 1 point let's 1.026. Right?
23:04
This shouldn't have a huge difference um
23:06
if our model is good. So if we went
23:08
ahead and run this
23:10
change.
23:13
Yep. So we can see here the cap m only
23:15
changed by a little bit changing it to
23:17
119 uh 9% which shows that um generally
23:21
our mark our model is generally pretty
23:23
robust because of the fact that it
23:25
didn't change by a ton even even when we
23:27
changed by about a percent in our actual
23:29
um values that we provide to it. So it
23:32
wasn't like just by chance that it gave
23:34
us our values. And so now that we've
23:36
validated our code, we can move on to
23:38
evolving. Uh and in the future, I think
23:40
some more definitive measures uh
23:42
definitive measures and data for
23:43
risk-free rate market return could
23:44
definitely improve the model. Right? I
23:46
just found some sources online that
23:48
describe what was happening at the time.
23:49
But I could probably pull data and give
23:51
a more definitive or I guess my own
23:53
analysis on those risk-free rates and
23:55
market returns and give um my own I
23:58
guess analyzed risk-free rates and
24:01
market return in order to use in the
24:03
analysis. Um, also being able to
24:05
quantify more parts of behavioral
24:06
analysis. You can definitely see these
24:08
things being shown in the data, but
24:10
being able to quantify them and maybe
24:11
tie them more and comparing them to, and
24:14
I kind of talked this here, but creating
24:16
visualizations for what a rational
24:17
investor may have predicted prior to the
24:18
event could be useful because we can
24:20
compare that to behavioral analysis and
24:22
potentially see the effects of
24:23
behavioral analysis um uh to see how
24:26
much um the behavioral of the behavior
24:30
of investors and everything that
24:32
happened outside of purely fundamentals
24:34
would have actually affected the stock
24:35
price.
24:37
And also there's the final output is
24:39
kind of confusing at times, right? Like
24:41
it is a lot of data given to you and
24:44
spat out your own words. Uh being able
24:46
to sort this in a more way could also be
24:48
a way to improve this in the future. And
24:50
so now moving on reflect. Uh we
24:52
successfully made an analysis with the
24:53
visualizations and key values. And I'm
24:55
just going to move on to theoretical
24:56
implications really quickly before we
24:58
move on there. Um and so we can look at
25:00
here under the effective market
25:02
hypothesis. This situation violated a
25:05
lot of its assumptions. We described
25:06
this a lot already because of all that
25:08
public information as we mentioned
25:10
before. Um effective market hypothesis
25:12
s",,,
ys that previous information and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:14:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
public already uh present public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information should already be faced in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:18:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock price. But in this case, we broke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:20:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that because of the fact that Reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:22:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where even though there was a lot of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:23:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
public discussions going on, um the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:25:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
effects were still able to be hugely um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:28:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was still able to be a huge swing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:30:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for once that information was taken to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:32:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainstream. So even though it was public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:34:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information, it wasn't already factored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:35:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in either because it was so small uh and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:38:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they hadn't completely done anything yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:40:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or because no one ever really thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:42:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were going to be able to have a big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:43:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enough effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:45:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And in comparison to effective market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis, behavioral analysis gives us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:49:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a much better idea of what happened and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:51:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why by giving us a lot more of that why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:53:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and how. Whereas effective market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:55:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis just believes that a lot of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:57:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those things are already going to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25:58:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factored into the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so when it comes to uh and it move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:03:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more so from that um we can see how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:05:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody who was actively trading in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:06:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this case versus passively trading might,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:08:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have been able to benefit from this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:09:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
situation more because they might have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen that GameStop was having a huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:13:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
increase or maybe even seeing that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:14:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
predictability pattern where it was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
starting to increase a little bit. Um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:18:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if they knew that the stock was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:19:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being heavily shorted they might have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:21:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jumped on that bandwagon before that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:23:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huge spike occurred. And so someone who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:24:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is actively trading might have been able,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:26:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to benefit a lot from this more from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:28:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody who was passive because chances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are if they're passive they're probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:31:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using more fundamental analysis and they,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:34:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking at GameStop it's not a very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:35:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
attractive choice so they probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:36:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't have bought it. And then lastly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:39:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with all that being said in terms of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:41:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
market efficiency this entire event kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:42:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of shows how the market isn't always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:44:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fully efficient and even publicly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:45:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
available information um isn't going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always be factored into that stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:49:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price. Uh and then furthermore, this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:50:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
entire situation kind of brought into,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:52:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question of trading meme stocks, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:54:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
legability of it and kind of brought it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:56:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more onto the main stage um right with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26:59:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like Congress and uh government and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:01:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
governments as they realize how much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:03:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power retail investors can truly have in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:05:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the market uh when publicly discussing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:08:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then so finally um just to recap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything that we've done, we also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analyze the event based off of market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:14:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency. We managed to compare uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
based on the effective market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:17:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis, behavioral finance and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:19:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rational investor profitability analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:21:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and compare those different viewpoints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:23:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um this ultimately took a bunch of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:24:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different tries in order to get the AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:26:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to do what I wanted it to do, but we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:28:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eventually got there. Um I think it took,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around six or seven tries and also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:31:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changing the representing plan. Um as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:34:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mentioned here, uh you use that utilize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:36:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the AI and give us a clearer plan that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:38:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the AI would be able to then um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:40:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understand easier to give us our final,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27:42:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
product. But yeah," thank""",,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",FALSE,1,"00:00 Uhm, my name is Ryan Date and welcome to my session 8 assignment to just jump right into things, uhm, starting with the D method of the driver method.
00:12 Pardon me, the D portion of the driver method, define and discover, uhm, a quick factual correction of the GameStop timeline.
00:20 Uh, GameStop did not trade at 4 cents in August 22, or in August 2020, pardon me, as the assignment suggests at the beginning of Per Exchange Historical Data, uh, GME closed at around $1.67 on August 31, 2020.
00:36 And in late August 2020, it traded for roughly $1.20 to $1.80 intraday. Uhm, I have a screenshot for you. From the Yahoo Finance data displaying that information with the highs of the day, the lows of the day, uhm, and the closing price along with some other information.
00:54 Uhm, so I just wanted to address that data point to begin with. Now moving on to our goal, it's to assess whether the GME episode is inconsistent.
01:04 With market efficiency, the various forms of market efficiencies, uhm, identify the anomalies and evaluate rational profit opportunities. Uhm, and the key discovered facts that we can use as inputs here are historical prices, uh, the short interest at around $100,000.
01:20 The Robinhood trading restrictions, the Ryan Cohen stake announcements, the Melvin capital losses. Uh, the massive retail trading volumes and social media coordination.
01:34 For the represent stage, I just wanted to. Create a chart displaying what happened with the, with the, uhm, GameStop surge.
01:43 So here you can see. January 11th, um, active investor, Ryan Cohen joins the GameStop board. It's about 13%. Um, and over the next couple days, the stock price triggered a short squeeze, further driving up the price.
01:59 Uhm, At this point, January, uh, January 20th, around there, uhm, Reddit users on r slash WallStreetBets joined up forces. to buy the still heavily shorted GameStop shares, and the short sellers are forced to abandon their positions and buy up GameStop.
02:17 GameStop shares, losing billions in the process, uhm, on January 27th, and at this point the stock is up 135%. Uhm, and then around January 29th of February, the stock tumbles as the frenzy dies down and it's cash in.
02:33 Uhm, so some noteworthy things here. GME's price rose dramatically in mid-January to late-January 21, uhm, from about $10 to $20 to $300-plus in a few days.
02:48 A very large data percentage change. For example, one week in January, it returned, uh, about 236%. Extreme volatility. And trading volume spiking in the squeeze phase.
03:00 Uhm, now, to test what forms of volatility. The market efficiency were violated in my represent stage. I created this chart with the, uh, form of efficiency.
03:13 Uhm, and the status during the GME event, and the explanation explaining, uh, why that violation, or lack of, lack thereof, was concluded.
03:26 Uhm, so for the weak form, efficiency, I, we, I, with the assistance of AI, I concluded that it was partially violated, uhm, temporary momentum and speculation.
03:37 For the semi-strong form of efficiency, it was completely violated, uhm, prices detached from the public fundamentals, uhm, and for strong form efficiency, it was not clearly violated.
03:52 There wasn't an insider report. There a driver advantage detected and it was more mispricing due to behavioral factors. Now for the implement stage of the training.
04:01 I have created Python code to examine the GME search. The code takes data from sources such as Yahoo Finance to create an analysis of the stock trading price as well as compare it to a benchmark such as a NASDAQ.
04:14 Uhm, this code can be seen in my collab notebook which is displayed here. Just to sort of walk through the code.
04:21 Right at the beginning it sets the parameters, uhm, and identifies the event dates to test, at which point it then fetches the data from the outside web.
04:33 sources, this requires internet, uhm, then it uses the adjusted close returns, uhm, and it computes the daily log. Then it creates an estimation of market model, uhm, and an event study function.
04:49 After that, it creates, er, it runs the event studies for each event, and produces data outputs, which can be all be seen here, and then there's some additional analysis, autocorrelation, uhm, predictability to predictability.
05:06 Measuring squeeze, uhm, and then it plots the price and the volume for the January 2021 period. Here is a chart that I created showing the events of January 2021.
05:22 Of the GameStop stock compared to the Nasdaq. And as you can see, the Nasdaq. Uhm, increases in value very slowly, but steadily.
05:35 Uhm, and the, GameStop stock shoots up in January 2021, uhm, has a lot of volatility, a lot of unpredictability.
05:46 And then comes back down to a reasonable price by 2022, really. Uhm, and what this displays is the year. Here on the x-axis and the indexed price, uhm, base 100 on the y-axis.
06:01 And the red line is the GME stock, obviously, and the blue, the NASDAQ. Now, moving on to the verify stage, the fee stage of driver.
06:10 Some observations or an empirical summary of what we found, uh, huge abnormal returns, right? Returned thousands of percent in late 2021.
06:22 Uhm, an example would be in the month of January, it went from about 17,000 to to intraday, uh, to intraday highs of $483, which is absurd.
06:32 Uhm, extreme CAR is inconsistent. Normal pricing dynamic. Uhm, and for predictability and momentum, a large positive, or, or, sorry, there are a lot of large positives.
06:42 Positive autocorrelations and momentum were evident during the squeeze. Returns were not, uhm, random walk-life, or walk-like in general. Uhm, and then for information incorporation, the market did react to some public fundamentals.
06:58 Uhm, such as the Ryan Cohen 13D filings, leading to earlier price rises, but the Reddit-driven rally appears to be, to reflect coordination and social momentum, and mechanical short-squeeze dynamics beyond the, uh, new fundamental information.
07:16 Uhm, looking at the market micro, microstructure effects and trading holds, broker restrictions, and, and clearing house margining, uh, materially changed who could trade and when, and this interrupted natural price discovery.
07:30 And looking at the interpretation versus EMH, uh, weak EMH was violated in the short run during the squeeze. Past intraday returns helped predict near-term future returns due to non-fundamental buying pressure and forced short covering.
07:46 For semi-strung inmates, it was partially violated. Uhm, public disclosure. Disclosures like 13th D were incorporated, uh, as expected, but public social signals and coordinated retail actions created persistent outbursts.
07:59 I have no more terms that were not immediately arbitrage in a way arbitrage the way also supported. Supply constraints, uhm, with short interest greater than 100% mean, mean prices move mechanically rather than.
08:15 Purely on new fundamental info undermining the semi strong predictions. And for strong images not supported. Private insider info or monopolized info is always possible.
08:27 Uhm, sellers and buyers, buyers with privileged access. can help perform, but it's just not, uhm, evident here. Uhm, the bottom line is the GME episode behaves like this.
08:40 Like, a failure of weak or semi-strong image in the short run, but many mechanisms help explain. Why markets fail to immediately correct prices.
08:51 Um, some of these are limits to arbitrage, supply constraints, and market migration. Moving on to the E stage of Driver, involve behavioral finance explanations, looking at what we saw.
09:04 Uhm, we saw hurting and social contagion, right, right at social, right, and other social media platforms created, uhm, coordinated. Buying and social reinforcement with, like, likes, the upvotes, all that narrative, and this produced information cascades.
09:20 Uhm, overconfidence and gambler's fallacy. Uh, retail traders were willing to accept high prices. High risk for outsized upside and community signaling.
09:32 And limited attention to insalient narratives. Stick it to Wall Street narrative. Amplified participation beyond fundamentals. Looking at would rational investors profit?
09:44 One of the central questions, uhm, for this assignment. Some traders profit massively ex post, but systematic. Profit opportunities were limited and risky.
09:56 You could be run over by momentum or kind of the wrong side of the squeeze. And. Arbitragers faced unlimited short risk and liquidity, uh, liquid, liquidity constraints.
10:08 Overall, risk-adjusted returns were not reliably positive for passive arbitrageurs, and given tail risk, and margin-level dynamics. The evidence for this is hedge funds, such as Melvin, incurring large losses.
10:24 Uhm, up to 53% in January, despite being on the right side, economically, for long periods. And for the final stage The GME episode shows that market prices can diverge sharply from fundamental value for extended periods.
10:48 When social coordination creates sustained buying pressure, uhm, supply is mechanically restrained, and market structure, Frictions limit arbitrage.
10:59 Uhm, and behavioral models and market structure frictions explain a lot to, ah, explains the hurting, limited attention, short squeeze mechanics, and liquidity margin constraints together.
11:11 Uhm, proof of producing the observed outcomes without invoking conspiracy. And looking at active versus passive management. For most investors, this episode supports limits, supports the limits of active management in dealing with social media driven events.
11:29 Active managers who try to arbitrage face extreme risks with some large firms lost heavily for a small sum of money.
11:37 A subset of traders who timed the moves well. Outsized gains were possible, but timing and luck played large roles.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello everyone, my name is Vihaan, and in this video, I'll demonstrate my ability to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, distinguish between its weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, and apply behavioral finance concepts to a real-world case — the GameStop short squeeze of 2020–2021.
Through this project, I integrate financial theory with empirical data analysis using the DRIVER framework, and I'll walk through both the conceptual reasoning and the Python code that supports my findings.The central research problem is to determine whether the GameStop short squeeze represents a violation of market efficiency or an anomaly explainable within existing theory.

Before any modeling, I began by verifying the factual accuracy of statements related to this event.
One claim in the prompt stated that ""GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020.""
To verify this, I used Python's yfinance library to download daily price data directly from Yahoo Finance.This command retrieved all daily data from August 2020 through February 2021, covering the critical event window.
By examining the first few rows of the dataset, I confirmed that GameStop traded around $4 per share in August 2020, not four cents.I also checked for missing values in the dataset using: This ensured my data was clean and ready for analysis.

Finally, to confirm peak event prices, I retrieved GameStop's closing price on January 27, 2021: The output showed a closing price above $347, validating one of the key facts about the price surge.

With the data verified, we can proceed to understand what actually happened.

Timeline summary:

August 2020: GME near $4 per share; heavy short interest at 100–140% of float.

September 2020: Ryan Cohen acquires a 13% stake in the company.

January 2021: A massive retail buying wave pushes the price to $483 intraday.

February 2021: Congressional hearings are held on possible market manipulation.

Afterward: The stock stabilizes between $15 and $25, closer to fundamental value.

R – Represent

In this stage, I designed my analytical plan.
My goal was to test market efficiency by examining whether GameStop's price behavior aligned with EMH predictions.

I structured my analysis around four components:

Market Efficiency Testing – Identify which EMH form was violated.

Abnormal Return Analysis – Measure returns relative to expected CAPM benchmarks.

Behavioral Finance Evaluation – Identify biases like herding and overconfidence.

Profitability Assessment – Evaluate if rational investors could systematically profit.

Data Sources:

Yahoo Finance for prices and volumes,

FINRA and Bloomberg for short interest,

Reuters and SEC filings for major event announcements.

By using Python, I could visualize GME's closing price and volume trends over time, identify event windows, and later compute cumulative abnormal returns if extended.

This design ensured the project followed a structured empirical process consistent with financial research standards.

I – Implement

Now let's look at what the code actually reveals.

The first step was visualization — plotting GME's daily closing price and trading volume.
Here, we see GameStop's price staying flat near $4–$5 until late 2020, followed by an explosive rise in January 2021 reaching $483. At the same time, trading volume increased by nearly ten times, confirming the scale of retail activity.

The data showed that while GameStop's fundamentals barely changed, the abnormal returns were extreme — far exceeding any expected return predicted by the CAPM model or by normal volatility.

If extended, we could compute abnormal returns like this: The goal here is to test whether GameStop's returns deviated significantly from market expectations.

The results clearly show large positive abnormal returns during January 2021, which implies that semi-strong efficiency was violated, as prices did not reflect rational valuation.V – Validate

Next, I interpreted these findings in the context of EMH.

Weak-form efficiency, which suggests past prices can't predict future returns, was mostly intact since the surge wasn't predictable using historical data.

Semi-strong form efficiency, which assumes that all public information is immediately incorporated into prices, was violated — the market ignored Ryan Cohen's stake in September 2020, then massively overreacted months later.

Strong-form efficiency, which holds that even insider information is reflected in price, was also violated, since insiders and hedge funds were blindsided.

From a rational investor profitability perspective, while some investors gained massive profits, these were not sustainable or risk-adjusted.
The event was unpredictable ex-ante and only obvious ex-post, meaning EMH largely holds in the long term.

Behavioral finance explains the short-term deviations.
The data and online activity reveal clear herding, overconfidence, loss aversion, and anchoring to high prices.
Platforms like Reddit's r/wallstreetbets amplified crowd sentiment, creating momentum divorced from fundamentals.

Limits to arbitrage, such as risk controls, margin calls, and broker restrictions by Robinhood, prevented institutions from restoring efficiency quickly — allowing the mispricing to persist longer than usual.

E – Evolve

Now, let's discuss the theoretical and policy implications.

First, the GameStop event shows that markets can temporarily deviate from efficiency, but they tend to self-correct once emotional and structural pressures subside.

Second, for investors, the takeaway is that passive investing remains more reliable than trying to exploit short-term anomalies.
The retail traders who joined late mostly suffered large losses, while long-term investors experienced stable returns.

Third, the event suggests policy improvements are needed — especially in short-sale transparency, social media regulation, and broker-dealer liquidity management to prevent distortions.

Finally, this case illustrates the importance of understanding market microstructure — how trading restrictions, order routing, and liquidity shocks can all amplify behavioral inefficiencies.

R – Reflect

Reflecting on the entire process, this project demonstrates how financial theory and empirical data work together.
The GameStop short squeeze challenges the semi-strong form of EMH, but also reinforces its validity over longer horizons.

Through this DRIVER process, I:

Verified historical data accuracy,

Systematically analyzed market efficiency using code,

Integrated EMH theory with behavioral insights, and

Evaluated investor rationality under extreme conditions.

Ultimately, GameStop's case reveals that markets are not perfectly efficient at all times, but efficiency remains a strong long-term equilibrium that reasserts itself once emotions fade.
The episode highlights why data-driven, disciplined investing is critical in preventing irrational decision-making.


Through this analysis, I've demonstrated my ability to understand and test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, distinguish between its forms, apply behavioral finance concepts, evaluate evidence for and against efficiency, and analyze real-world events systematically using the DRIVER framework.
By integrating financial theory with Python-based empirical analysis and communicating findings clearly, this project achieves all key learning objectives of the assignment.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Kaden and this is my
management 310 assignment 8 project.
In this assignment I will
provide a structured analysis of the
2020 and 2021 GameStop short squeeze
specifically to investigate the
principles of the market efficiency.
So, the case study is GameStop from
2020 to 2021. The objective is to
investigate the market efficiency and
analysis price behavior related
to the efficient market hypothesis
and evaluate market anomalies. I will
be using driver framework to structure
my analysis.
The primary objective of this assignment
is to use the GameStop event case
study to test the efficient market
hypothesis. My analysis required to verify historical data, test
the different forms of market
efficiency, evaluate behavioral
explanations and access the implications
for investment theory. I have structured
this entire process using the driver
framework. The methodology of the
driver framework. Consists of the
define and discover where I state the
problem and verify all initial data.
Represent, acquire and structure the
complete data set for analysis.
Implement ex execute the technical
analysis including the calculations and
visualizations.
Validate cross reference results with
assignment data to ensure accuracy.
evolve, analysis, analyze the
implications of findings
on investment strategy and then
reflect where I synthesize the
efficient market hypothesis theory with
behavioral finance concepts.
The driver framework provides a six step
methodology. I will begin by defining
the problem and discovering the facts. I
will then show how I represented the
data implemented the analysis. Finally, I
will validate the results and involve
the findings to conclude reflection on
market theory. I will now proceed with
step one with the define and discover.
So for the define and discover
I verifying the critical step it was
clear we were testing the efficient
market hypothesis. The discover stage
began with a critical data ver
verification test. The assignment
provided a statement GameStop traded at
 4 cents in August 2020. My first tech
 technical task was to verify this
fact. So, I used the Python script 
Yahoo Finance library and download the
actual historical trading data  for
GameStop in August 2020.
You can see from the script the scripts
outline the claim
 was found to be incorrect.
 the co's analysis of the historical
data showed the lowest split adjusted
price in August 2020 was $1.39.
While the price was indeed very low, it
was not 4 cents. This finding was
significant as  it underscores the
importance of validating all given
information before an in analyzing. I
proceeded using the verified historical
data and step two was represent 
acquiring and summarizing the event data
set.
Here I moved from a single data point to
acquire the complete data set for the
entire event using the script. I
downloaded GameStop price history from
January 1st, 2020 to December 31st,
2021. The code then generate a high
level of statistical summary of this
data.
which is right here. This summary
 table provides our first look at
the anonymity.
The maximum price exceeded 480 while the
mean or average price was only 22
most importantly the standard deviation
a measure of voluntary was 22.
Most importantly, a standard deviation of this
magnitude which is larger than mean
itself is a stronger statistical
indicator of extreme instability
and a significant deviation from the
normal market behavior.
 next was calculating the daily
returns for volatility analysis. Step
 where the main analysis occurs as a
proxy for an event study. I implemented
a calculation for a simple daily
returns. This measures day-to-day price
changes as a key indicator of
volatility.
My script calculated this for the
entire data set and then generated 
statistical summary of these daily
returns
which is right here. So we have
the table is highly revealing the max
value being 1.35 indicates that on the best day the
stock prices increased by 135% in a single
trading session. 
this level of return is a clear anomaly.
 but the most powerful part of the
implementation is the visual analysis.
As you can see the visual analysis has
an event timeline and market anomaly. 
this chart generated by my script is a
the central piece of evidence of this
analysis. The blue line is the GameStop
price. The gray band represents the 10
to to 40 fundamental value range
provided by analysis for the most of
2020. You can see the price trades with
within a near fundamental value. The
green dotted line marks the news of Ryan
Cohan's investment in September 2020.
The market reacts to this new public
information and the price begins to
drift up. This is a const constant with
a efficient market. Then in January
2021, the price completely disconnects
from the fundamental reality. It
explodes over $400 dri driven not
by new comp company information but by
social media statement in this short
squeeze.
This visual demonstrates a clear
violation of the semi- strong form
market
efficiency. This states that prices
should reflect all public available
information. Here the price is clearly
reflecting the hard behavior and
and behavioral factors not from
public fundamentals.
Validate. Step four is validate. It
is a cross check to ensure my NASIS is
sound. The assignment material noted a
peak price of $483.
I used my code to find the maximum price
and downloaded
a data set to verify this.
As the output shows my data set
identified the peak
high of of $483.
this figure aligns directly with the
assignment data. This validation
confirms my data set is correct and the
analysis performed is the implement
phase is based on accurate relevant
data.
Step five is evolve
where we analyze the strategic
implementation of these findings. The
event might suggest that active
trading is superior as some traders won
big. However, this is a dangerous
conclusion. For every small trader who
profited, many others brought bought at
the peak and suffered massive losses.
Furthermore, a highly sophisticated
active investor, the hedge fund Melvin
Capital, lost billions by betting
against the anomaly.
Therefore, this event does not prove
that superior of active management.
Instead, it highlights the extreme risk
of departing from a fundamental based
strategy. For the average investor, this
event reforces the principles of passive
long-term diversified
investing as a means to avoid such
sculpticated risk.
Finally, step six, reflection on the
theoretical implications. This event
does not
by itself disprove the efficient market
hypothesis. Markets are on average and
over the long term largely efficient.
What the GameStop event demonstrates is
the critical interplay between the
market efficiency and the behavioral
finance. The efficient the efficient
market hypothesis can be seen as the
physics of the market. The rules of
value and information it strives to
follow. Behavioral finance is the
psychology. Human bias like hurting,
overconfidence, and loss aversions can
that can under specific conditions
overwhelm the system. In January 2021, a
perfect storm of social media market
structure issues like high short
interest in human psychology created a
temporary violent break from the physics
of the market. The event shows that the
a complete understanding of the market
requires a sensics of both theories.
In conclusion, by following the driver
framework, I was able to systematically
move from an initial data cury to a full
scale analysis. I verified the initial
data by implementing a visual analysis
that  clearly demonstrated the anomaly by
validating my results in conclusion that
the event is a powerful real world
example of behavioral finance and
action. It shows that while markets
strive for efficiency, they are
ultimately driven by human participants.
And that's all. Thank you.

So this presentation is about the
0:04
session 8 project. Um I'm going to use a
0:07
GameStop short squeeze and post on an
0:09
announcement example to investigate
0:11
market efficiency. So here is the big
0:13
research question for session 8. Are
0:16
markets basically rational information
0:18
processing machines like the efficiency
0:20
market hypothesis that we learned in
0:22
session 8 suggest? Or are prices heavily
0:25
shaped on human psychology and
0:27
predictable mistakes? And do humans
0:29
basically decide the prices or the
0:30
markets do like behavioral finance
0:32
suggest? So we will use the driver
0:35
framework.
0:37
So the assignment gives us very specific
0:39
measures. So this is what we already
0:41
have from the 2020 to 2021 GameStop
0:45
short squeeze. In August 2020, GME was
0:48
trading at uh near bankruptcy levels. In
0:51
September 2020, uh, Ryan Cohen, the
0:53
founder of Chewy, bought the company at
0:55
about bought about 13% of the company.
0:58
In January 2021, there was a massive
1:00
price search gi driven by Reddit's uh,
1:03
tweets and Gamestock started hitting at
1:06
$483.
1:08
Short interest peaked at about 140% of
1:11
the float. Retail um, trading volume
1:14
exploded because obviously the stock was
1:16
giving such high returns to everyone. A
1:20
huge major hedge fund, Melvin Capital,
1:22
lost about 53% and needed a bailout.
1:25
Analysts fundamental value estimates
1:27
were in the range of about $10 to $40
1:29
per share, but as we just found out was
1:31
trading at $483 per share. We are also
1:36
asked to use a post earnings
1:37
announcement drift uh scenario as a
1:40
smaller lab efficient uh example
1:41
efficiency. A tech stock beats earnings
1:44
by 15%. the stock jumps 5% and uh then
1:49
it keeps drifting 1% per week. So the
1:52
guiding question that I found out from
1:54
all of this and the guiding question
1:55
that I will be exploring today is does
1:57
this kind of gradual drift after new
2:00
information like earnings for GameStop
2:01
news represent true market inefficiency
2:04
because analysts told were told that the
2:06
shares were worth around $10 to $40 but
2:09
were sh like going at $483 or it can
2:13
still be explained as a rational market
2:15
behavior like just what the market does.
2:19
So to discover what's really going on, I
2:21
first remind myself what efficient
2:23
market hypothesis actually says. So it
2:25
basically says that stock prices fully
2:27
react all available information. So you
2:30
cannot consistently earn higher returns
2:32
just by analyzing public data. So there
2:35
are three main forms of this. Weak form,
2:37
semi- strong form and strong form. Weak
2:39
form is like prices are determined by
2:41
past prices and volume information.
2:43
Semi-rong is all public information and
2:46
super like strong firm is basically all
2:49
the information in including the private
2:51
insider information that's going on in
2:53
the company. On the other side,
2:55
behavioral finance tells us that
2:58
investors are human. Investors are
3:00
overconfident and we anchor on initial
3:02
numbers. They don't follow the trends.
3:04
They don't follow and we hate losses
3:07
more than we love gains. And it also
3:10
tells us that these systematic biases
3:12
can create predictable patterns called
3:14
anomalies like momentum, value, size,
3:16
effect, and calendar effects.
3:19
So today in what I'm going to do, I'm
3:21
going to use the driver framework to
3:24
analyze a post earnings draft example in
3:26
code. Use that to build in institution
3:30
uh about what an ineffective pattern
3:32
looks like. and then link back logic
3:35
link logic back to GameStop case and ask
3:37
what form of EMH seems violated.
3:42
So now let's go to the represent stage.
3:44
So this assignment points me to event
3:46
study methodology and event study looks
3:49
at returns around a specific event. So
3:51
from uh days 10 to 1 is the estimation
3:54
period, day 0 is the event day and more
3:56
than 10 days is the postevent period. So
3:59
the formula that we use is abnormal
4:01
return A R is equal to actual return
4:04
minus the expected return and the
4:06
expected return can be found from CAPM
4:08
that we learned in session 7 which is E
4:11
is equal to alpha into beta alpha plus
4:13
beta into market return.
4:16
So here's the framework in words. First
4:18
estimate what a normal return would be
4:20
given the stock's risk in the market.
4:22
Compare what it actually happens at
4:24
around that event. The difference is
4:27
surprise or abnormal return. If a market
4:29
is semi- strong efficient, most abnormal
4:31
return should happen immediately to when
4:34
information about that company is
4:35
released in market. And if a normal
4:38
return drifts for several days after the
4:40
news, it looks like a potential
4:41
inefficiency in the news.
4:44
So this is what we have for the data.
4:47
Everything is locked up. The stock beta
4:49
is at 1.3. Risk free return rate is 0.03
4:52
and market PM is 0.08.
4:56
So I'll walk you through the Python
4:58
script now from the assignment. Uh it
5:00
simulates a post earnings announcement
5:02
disc for GameStop. I'll show you the
5:03
code and explain in plain language what
5:05
everything is doing. So let's run the
5:08
code for now. So the code is run
5:11
and this is what we get. So yeah, don't
5:14
get confused. I'll explain what this
5:15
means. Um so in simple terms at top we
5:19
import random and print heather saying
5:20
we're doing a post earnings announcement
5:22
drift analysis. We have kept the stock
5:24
beta to 1.3 which means that the stock
5:26
is more volatile than the market and the
5:29
risk free rate and the market premium
5:31
are there to represent the general idea
5:33
of expected returns. Although uh in this
5:36
simplified script um we mainly use beta
5:39
and small alpha.
5:41
So we create a list from minus 10 to
5:45
positive 10 days which is a span of 20
5:48
days. Negative days are before the
5:49
earnings report. Zero is the
5:51
announcement day of the earnings report
5:53
and positive days are the after earnings
5:56
report uh what happens to the stock
5:58
return.
6:01
So in the fall loop uh that we have in
6:03
this uh we generate a random market
6:05
return each day between minus2 to plus
6:08
2%. And that's a simplified overall
6:10
market movement.
6:14
So after we generate the stock returns
6:16
we calculate the abnormal returns in the
6:18
code. We compute normal red the stock
6:21
return. The difference is abnormal
6:24
return and we also accumulate this into
6:27
the accumulative abnormal return in the
6:29
very end
6:31
and we split the abnormal returns into
6:33
three parts. We will split it into post
6:35
earnings which is minus1 to 10
6:38
announcement day which is day zero and
6:41
then the post earnings report which is 1
6:43
to 10.
6:45
And then finally we will compute an
6:47
efficiency ratio where we will have the
6:49
immediate reaction on the abnormal day
6:51
at day zero. The post drift is the sum
6:54
of abnormal returns from day plus 1 to +
6:56
5. Total reaction is day 0 plus the
6:58
drift and efficiency ratio is the
7:00
immediate reaction. If more than 80%
7:03
happens on day zero we call it mostly
7:05
effective. If 60 to 80% happens we call
7:08
it moderately effective. And if less
7:10
than 60% happens then we can call it a
7:12
potential ineffectivity.
7:15
The important thing in this script is
7:17
that we're not trying to be realistic
7:19
like we're not using the real values of
7:21
the GameStop from World Wars in 2020. So
7:25
this is a simulation of an event of
7:27
study and it shows how to connect the
7:29
numbers back to the EMS and how much of
7:31
the reaction is immediate and uh versus
7:33
delayed.
7:36
So if I run the script a few times, I
7:38
see something like pre- earnings average
7:40
abnormal returns are close to zero. So
7:44
almost all these stock like the abnormal
7:47
the returns are close to zero
7:51
and then on announcement day there's a
7:53
big positive abnormal return of uh 5%
7:57
over here and then over days + 1 to + 5
8:01
there is still positive abnormal returns
8:03
maybe another few percentage points that
8:06
is the post earnings drift.
8:10
So if markets were perfectly semi-
8:12
strong efficient nearly all abnormal
8:13
returns uh should be on day zero but as
8:17
you can see there are more abnormal
8:18
returns happening after the day. In fact
8:21
the fact that this crypto delberty
8:23
builds and drift means that we are
8:25
modeling a world where the market does
8:27
not instantly process all information.
8:29
This by construction is an inefficiency
8:32
but obviously um we'll come to the
8:35
validate state now.
8:37
So is drift statistically significant?
8:41
Is it reliably different from zero
8:43
across many events or could it be just
8:45
random noise that is happening and like
8:48
small menu changes that are happening
8:50
like after the day zero? Is it
8:52
economically significant? Is the profit
8:55
after cost spreads and risk still
8:57
meaningful? A 1 to 2% lift might be
8:59
wiped out by trading frictions and how
9:02
persistent the um return is.
9:06
So in the GameStop assignment, we are
9:08
asked to classify which form of EM is
9:11
violated, analyze how information was
9:13
incorporated into the price, look at the
9:15
abnormal returns and predictability.
9:18
So with the G uh GME stock, prices did
9:22
not calmly adjust to new fundamental
9:24
information. is that social media
9:27
extreme short interest and detail uh
9:29
hering produce enormous swings to the
9:33
like the abnormality and the price of
9:35
the stock and from semi- strong EMH lens
9:39
this looks like an extreme case where
9:40
public information may not have been
9:42
profess pro processed in a rational and
9:44
timely way on day zero so let's look at
9:48
this from a behavioral basis the
9:50
assignment explicitly list basis
9:52
overconfidenting
9:54
anchoring loss aversion and mental
9:56
accounting. So in gamesoft you can see
9:58
overconfidence. Many traders believe
10:00
they could outsmart the hedge funds
10:02
hurting people piled in because others
10:05
were doing it especially on Reddit. So
10:08
more people buying the stock the stock
10:09
goes up the valuation increases. This is
10:12
a very normal thing that keeps happening
10:13
with such noisy stocks and less aversion
10:17
and mental accounting. Uh some treated
10:19
GME as a fun money or lottery tickets
10:22
while others refused to sell at a loss
10:24
and they were like we're going to wait
10:26
we're going to hope it goes up. So let's
10:29
look at the limit to the arbitrage even
10:32
if some investors believe that the price
10:34
was irrationally high which is more than
10:37
it was more than a,000% high because it
10:40
was valued at around $10 to $40 but it
10:42
was $483.
10:44
So it becomes extremely dangerous to
10:46
short the stock because shorting
10:48
interest would uh already massive will
10:50
be massive. So you would basically not
10:52
get a lot back on the stock. Brokers
10:55
restricted uh the trading on the stock
10:58
obviously and prices could jump to
11:00
hundreds of percents in a day. So it was
11:02
a very volatile stock with changes
11:04
happening almost every day. So this is a
11:06
classic example of why inefficiencies
11:08
can persist. It's not enough to be right
11:11
about the fair value. You also have to
11:13
survive in the path and the prices to
11:15
get there to get to the right value.
11:19
So markets can mostly be efficient most
11:21
of the time. But in specific situations
11:23
like such a stock where Reddit drove the
11:25
stock value to another high to a new
11:28
high behavioral forces and structural
11:30
constraints can generate huge
11:32
temporarily divisions from fundamental
11:34
value.
11:36
So here is my aha moment. At first, it's
11:39
very tempting to think that if EMF is
11:42
true, even like GameStop shouldn't
11:43
happen. So, EMH is wrong. The markets
11:46
are just crazy. The markets are just
11:48
like increasing values of stocks here
11:50
and there because there's more interest
11:52
coming into the stocks. The real
11:54
question here is not are markets
11:56
efficient or crazy. It's about how
11:58
efficient they are or how inefficient
12:00
they are and over what time horizon are
12:03
they efficient or inefficient. So this
12:05
code will simply like tells us that
12:07
prices react very quickly to the news.
12:10
As soon as a news of the companies out
12:11
on day zero, that is when the abnormal
12:14
return will be the most. It can be a
12:17
drift that kind of looks like an
12:19
inefficiency. Yet turning that pattern
12:21
into real risk adjusted profit is very
12:23
hard especially after the cost and risk.
12:26
So the GameStop case basically shows us
12:28
that behavioral finance is like crucial.
12:31
Human psychology and social media can
12:34
practically change what a stock is worth
12:36
and practically change the views on that
12:38
stock. If a stock is if say a company is
12:40
not doing well but human psychology and
12:42
social media can make the stock still
12:44
plummet. Uh limits to arbitrage means
12:47
that even obvious mispricings can't
12:50
easily be fixed by rational traders.
12:52
Shorting the stock isn't going to help
12:55
and it doesn't mean that the markets are
12:57
totally random or hopeless obviously
12:59
because this been going for a while. It
13:01
just means that some companies are it's
13:04
mostly efficient with like some
13:06
companies having those small little
13:08
inefficiencies in the middle due to
13:10
human psychology and behavioral finance.
13:14
So my emerging investment prof
13:16
philosophy is treat markets with respect
13:19
assume they are hard to beat on an
13:21
average. Don't think that because the
13:22
stock is plummeting, it will go on
13:25
plummeting or selling at a loss is a bad
13:27
thing. Use passive index strategies as
13:30
strong foundations. Obviously, make a
13:32
diversified portfolio. You don't want to
13:33
just invest in GameStop and then look at
13:36
the price right now. It's not as high as
13:38
483. In other words, markets are nearly
13:40
perfectly rational nor purely insane.
13:44
They are just humanic systems which
13:46
where behavioral finance comes into play
13:48
a lot. Usually if they are usually
13:51
effective efficient through lazy
13:53
strategy when lazy strategies fail but
13:56
imperfect enough that disciplined
13:58
analysis combined with an understanding
14:00
of behavioral finance and psychology can
14:02
sometimes add value.
14:05
That's the balance I take away from

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone,
In this project, I'm analyzing the GameStop (GME) short squeeze from 2020 to 2021 to see how it relates to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH.
Some sources claimed that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020.
 That's incorrect — according to Yahoo Finance, the real price was around $4 per share, not four cents.
Here's a quick timeline of the event:
* August 2020: Stock around $4, company struggling.

* September 2020: Ryan Cohen (founder of Chewy) buys a 13% stake.

* January 2021: Reddit's r/wallstreetbets community drives a price surge up to $483.

* February 2021: Congressional hearings begin after trading apps like Robinhood restricted trades.

* Afterward: Price eventually stabilized between $10 and $30.

So my main question is:
Did the GameStop short squeeze disprove market efficiency, or can it still fit within the EMH framework?
________________


💡 2. REPRESENT
Now, let's represent the problem using the three forms of market efficiency:
   * Weak Form: Prices reflect all past data (like trends or past prices).

   * Semi-Strong Form: Prices reflect all public information.

   * Strong Form: Prices reflect all information, even private or insider data.

I'm testing which form might have been violated during the GameStop event.
I'll also include behavioral finance factors — such as herding, FOMO, and overconfidence — since social media played a big role in this event.
________________


🧮 3. IMPLEMENT
Now let's look at the data.
I used Python and Yahoo Finance to download and analyze GameStop's stock prices.
  



When I ran this, the chart clearly showed the massive price spike in January 2021, where prices shot up over 1,000% in just a few days.
Trading volume also jumped about 10 times higher than usual, and short interest reached over 140% of the available shares — meaning more shares were shorted than actually existed.
That kind of activity is not normal in an efficient market.

To validate the results, I compared GME's returns with the overall market (S&P 500).
Here's a short piece of Python code that can compare GameStop's daily returns to the S&P 500's returns:
  



The validation shows that GameStop's abnormal returns were massive and statistically unusual — not explained by new public information.
That means the semi-strong form of EMH was likely violated because prices didn't adjust rationally or instantly to news.
________________


🚀 5. EVOLVE
From this event, we can see that the market was not efficient in the short term.
Prices were driven more by emotion and group behavior than fundamentals.
Many traders bought in due to social media hype, while hedge funds suffered big losses.
However, over time, prices returned closer to reality, showing that the market eventually corrected itself.
For most investors, trying to ""beat the system"" during the squeeze didn't work — most late buyers lost money when the price crashed.
So, while EMH struggled in the short term, it held up in the long term.
________________


💭 6. REFLECT
To wrap up, this case showed both sides of market theory.
It proved that:
      * The market can be irrational in the short term.

      * But over time, it tends to return to efficiency.

Behavioral finance gives us tools to understand why — herding, overconfidence, and fear of missing out made the GameStop bubble grow fast, but also pop fast.
The takeaway:
EMH still matters, but investor psychology can temporarily break it.
For most people, passive investing remains safer than chasing social media hype.

Today we're going to be doing a GameStop
0:05
case study, an investigation of market
0:08
efficiency.
0:13
We would like to investigate market
0:15
efficiency using the GameStop short
0:17
squeeze event of the 2020 to 2021 as a
0:20
case study. Verify the accuracy of
0:23
stated facts, analyze price behavior
0:25
relative to the efficient market
0:26
hypothesis predictions, and evaluate
0:29
whether market anomalies constitute
0:31
evidence against market efficiency or
0:33
can be explained within existing
0:35
frameworks.
0:36
Our first critical step is going to be
0:38
to verify the statement GameStop traded
0:40
at 4 cents in August of 2020 against
0:43
actual historical data. If incorrect,
0:46
document the accurate figures and
0:47
determine appropriate communication
0:49
approach for correcting the professor.
0:53
We also have an event timeline, some key
0:55
data points and required analysis.
0:58
In August of 2020, GME was near
1:00
bankruptcy levels. In September of 2020,
1:03
Ryan Cohen, the Chewy founder, acquires
1:06
13 per cent of stake. In January of
1:09
2021, Reddit users on r/wall street bets
1:13
drove the price surge to $483.
1:16
In February of 2021, congressional
1:19
hearings on market manipulation were
1:21
held. And in the present, postevent
1:23
price stabil stabilization.
1:27
Short interest peaked at 140% a float.
1:30
Retail trading volume increased 10fold
1:33
during the squeeze. Trading restrictions
1:35
implemented at peak. Hedge fund Melvin
1:38
Capital sustained 53% loss requiring
1:41
bailout and analyst fundamental value
1:43
estimates were between the 10 to 40 per
1:45
share per share.
1:47
Again, we want to verify all stated
1:49
historical price data and documents.
1:51
Document the corrections. We want to
1:54
test which form of market efficiency was
1:56
violated such as weak, semi- strong or
1:59
strong. Evaluate whether rational
2:01
investors could have profited
2:02
systematically. We want to compare the
2:05
efficient market hypothesis predictions
2:07
to observed behavior and we want to
2:09
assess behavioral finance explanations
2:11
for observed anomalies.
2:16
We're going to be working through the
2:17
driver framework. And to begin, we're
2:19
going to start in the divi defi define
2:21
and discover stage. Our goal is going to
2:24
be you to use GameStop's 2020 to 2021
2:28
short squeeze as a real world test of
2:30
market efficiency. The key questions we
2:33
would like to answer is are the stated
2:36
facts true? Which EMH forms were
2:38
violated? Was the GME surge a
2:41
predictable or systematic event that a
2:44
sophisticated investor could have
2:45
profited from it before it happened or
2:48
was a unique random outlier?
2:50
Are the anomalies better explained by
2:52
behavioral finance or limits to
2:54
arbitrage?
2:56
And was there rational factors or
2:59
behavioral factors such as hurting,
3:01
social media influence, and loss
3:03
aversion?
3:07
Now, we're going to discover some
3:08
background um around this scenario. So,
3:12
if you didn't know, GameStop is a
3:14
brickandmortar video game retailer
3:16
that's faced serious headwinds from the
3:18
digital game distribution during the CO
3:20
19 pandemic. Many institutional
3:23
investors believed that GME was on a
3:25
decline path and took large shortselling
3:28
positions, betting that the stock would
3:30
fall because the business looked weak.
3:32
By late 2020, GME had attracted
3:35
attention for other reasons. For
3:37
example, Ryan Cohen, the founder of
3:39
Chewy, took significant stake in GME and
3:41
and announced board changes, which
3:44
turned some heads.
3:46
Again, we have the events in August 2020
3:49
where the company share price was really
3:51
low and was viewed as distressed. In mid
3:55
to late 2020, we had um Ryan Cohen stake
3:59
and hype around possible transformation
4:01
which increased interest among some
4:03
retail investors. In January 2021,
4:06
that's when the surge begins and GME's
4:09
price started rising steeply. Retail
4:11
buyers from foreign such as Wall Street
4:13
Bets joined in massive volume. There was
4:16
the peak and the squeeze where the the
4:19
uh share price went up in many multiples
4:21
driven by a classic short squeeze which
4:24
means that sellers were for forced to
4:26
buy back shares adding fuel to the rally
4:28
and approximately 140% of the public
4:31
float was reported shorted. There was
4:34
also broker restrictions including
4:37
platforms such as Robin Hood which
4:39
restricted buying of GME shares citing
4:42
risk/clearing
4:43
deposit issues. This triggered backlash
4:46
and regulatory attention.
4:49
In the aftermath, price fell from peak.
4:51
Shore positions were closed and
4:53
volatility remained elevated. The
4:55
episode triggered major questions about
4:57
retail trading and social media
4:59
coordinization as well as market
5:00
structure.
5:04
Now that we've kind of defined our goal
5:06
and took a look at the background and
5:07
understood what this scenario is exactly
5:10
referencing, we can take a critical
5:12
first step.
5:14
GME was traded at 4 cents in August
5:17
2020. From our re my research, we can
5:21
see that this is incorrect. Um, adjusted
5:25
postsplit Yahoo data shows that August
5:28
2020 was close to $1.67. That's about
5:31
$6.68
5:33
pre-split, not $4. While it was very
5:36
low, just not that low. The appropriate
5:40
communication approach for correcting
5:42
the professor would be that based on
5:44
split adjusted Yahoo finance data GM's
5:47
August 2020 monthly close was about
5:50
$167. The stated figure of 4 cents
5:53
appears to be an error and for this case
5:55
study we will be using the split
5:57
adjusted figures.
6:01
Now we can move on to the represent
6:03
framework. We want to visualize a
6:05
systematic approach to testing market
6:08
efficiency.
6:09
So here we kind of have an advanced
6:11
study timeline. We want to look at the
6:13
10 days prior to the event. We want to
6:16
look at a key event of the start of the
6:19
short squeeze and the 10 days postevent.
6:24
We want to test for continued drip drift
6:26
and delayed reaction.
6:29
We want to take a look at our efficiency
6:31
benchmarks. Strong efficiency such as
6:34
abnormal returns, semi- strong
6:36
efficiency such as returns complete with
6:39
with uh within 1 to two days and weak
6:43
efficiency
6:44
which would be that drift continues for
6:46
several day several days without new
6:48
information.
6:50
We also can do some return analysis such
6:52
as normal return, abnormal abnormal
6:55
return and cumulative abnormal return.
6:59
We also want to look at behavioral
7:01
indicators such as volume spike which
7:03
may lead to hurting or attention bias or
7:06
be caused by we want to look at
7:08
multi-day shift a sign of overconfidence
7:11
or momentum in trading or delayed
7:14
correction the result of loss aversion
7:16
and diamond hands mentality.
7:21
So, our goal is to design a clear
7:23
step-by-step plan to test our key
7:26
questions from earlier using the
7:28
available data and financial concepts.
7:32
So, these are the three forms of market
7:34
efficiency. We have a weak form where
7:36
prices reflect all past price and volume
7:39
information, meaning technical analysis
7:42
does not work. This would be violated if
7:44
the retail buying was based purely on
7:46
momentum aka past returns and yet it
7:50
still generated profits.
7:52
Semi semi-trong form is when prices
7:55
reflect all publicly available
7:57
information. So fundamental analysis
8:00
does not work. This would be violated if
8:02
the price reaches $483
8:05
while the company's fundamentals
8:07
remained around $10 to $40 level. price
8:10
was clearly not reflecting
8:13
the public fundamental value.
8:16
Strong form is when prices reflect all
8:18
information, including private
8:20
information, meaning that insider
8:22
trading does not work. This would be
8:24
violated if insiders or early investors
8:28
or Reddit moderators profited
8:30
systematically for public awareness.
8:38
We also want to be sure to look at
8:40
behavioral finance biases. We're going
8:43
to want to match one of the observed GME
8:46
behavior to some of these psychological
8:48
patterns. So the first one that um could
8:52
be noticed is hurting. This is following
8:54
crowd behavior rather than doing any
8:56
kind of independent analysis. So if
8:59
retail investors were um just following
9:02
the crowd on Reddit on Wall Street Bets
9:06
um we also have availability heristic
9:09
which is investors would be relying too
9:11
heavily on information that is easily
9:13
available such as a screenshot or post
9:15
on Reddit rather than dull financial
9:18
analytics.
9:20
There's also anchoring which is over
9:23
relying on the first piece of
9:25
information received. So this would be
9:27
if investors were holding on to the idea
9:30
that GME was a cheap stock even though
9:32
that the price became extremely
9:34
inflated.
9:36
And then finally loss aversion. So hedge
9:39
funds like Melvin Capital may be
9:42
hesitant to cover up their short
9:44
positions quickly due to the pain of
9:46
realizing they've they've created a huge
9:49
loss and therefore making the situation
9:51
worse because they're choosing not to
9:53
make a change.
9:56
So now we can move on to the
9:58
implementation stage and I think some
10:01
Python calculations and visuals will be
10:04
really helpful for kind of understanding
10:08
analytically what happened in this
10:10
scenario. So we have some abnormal
10:12
return calculations as well as volume
10:14
analysis and pattern identification.
10:18
So here we have our GME market
10:20
efficiency analysis. We have the 10 days
10:23
before We have the event and then we
10:26
have the 10 days after. We have market
10:28
return, stock return, expected return
10:31
and abnormal return.
10:34
And from this we can see that before the
10:37
event the average abnormal return was uh
10:40
15%. On the day of it was at 25% and
10:45
then after the postevent 5-day total
10:48
drift was 2.54%.
10:52
The efficiency ratio is 90.79%.
10:57
We also have our abnormal returns around
11:00
the event chart which you can see this
11:03
giant spike in percentage.
11:06
We also have the cumulative abnormal
11:08
return and we can see the percentage
11:11
sits really low, spikes up and then is
11:14
um very high.
11:18
And then we have the um simulated
11:21
trading volume around the event. And you
11:23
can see that it's only a short term. Um
11:26
it sits really low and then there's a
11:28
lot of trading that goes on and then it
11:31
um goes back to being low again. So from
11:35
this we can see that the market is
11:37
mostly efficient. prices adjusted
11:40
quickly and there's possible behavioral
11:44
or mo momentum or hurting detected.
11:47
The abnormal returns measure how much
11:50
the stock moved beyond expectations. The
11:53
cumulative AR shows whether the market
11:55
just uh kept adjusting after the news
11:58
and the volume spikes suggest that there
12:01
was crowd detention or hurting. Markets
12:04
are mostly efficient but can still show
12:06
short-term inefficiencies.
12:10
And here's the code that I created in
12:12
order to calculate this. Um, we've
12:14
insert in um imported some um libraries
12:19
and we've set up the scenario and
12:21
simulated daily data around the event.
12:24
And then we have the um days before and
12:28
after. And then we have the table of the
12:31
results, summaries, and then all of our
12:33
visuals.
12:38
So the next thing we want to do is
12:39
verify the accuracy of historical
12:43
price data and document the corre
12:45
corrections. So I know we kind of
12:47
discussed um what exactly went happened
12:51
in the scenario in the um
12:55
define and discover stage but it's
12:57
important to clearly break down each
13:00
part of the timeline and the key data to
13:03
really understand what we're looking at
13:05
here. So,
13:08
it was true that GME was near bankruptcy
13:11
levels um in August of 2020 and it was
13:16
traded well below $3 and was in the
13:20
single digits by late summer. And this
13:22
is from a lot of this is going to be
13:24
from the CEC and other financial
13:26
websites. So in September of 2020 um as
13:30
well Brian Cohen did acquire around 13%
13:34
stake and then in January 2020 it surged
13:38
to $483.
13:40
This was um widely reported. I mean it
13:43
was big news and um many financial news
13:47
outlets were covering the GameStop short
13:49
squeeze event.
13:51
And then to be specific, the House
13:55
Financial Services Committee hearing
13:57
held fe on February 18th of 2021,
14:01
um they had a hearing titled GameStop,
14:03
who wins or loses in order to discuss
14:05
the event. And then it is true that that
14:09
short interest peaked around 140% of
14:12
float. And then
14:16
according to the CEC, retail trading
14:18
volume increased 10fold during the
14:20
squeeze.
14:22
There was also trading restrictions
14:24
implemented at peak um
14:28
on January 28th. Brokers including Robin
14:30
Hood restricted of buying of GME and
14:33
other meme stocks due to clearing house
14:35
margin requirements.
14:38
And then Melvin Capital reportedly lost
14:41
around 53% in January 2021 and received
14:45
2.7 billion in emergency capital
14:48
injections from Citadel/.72.
14:52
And then analyst fundamental values were
14:54
estimated to be around 10 to 40 per per
14:57
share.
15:00
Now we can really um start to look back
15:03
on the market efficiency hypothesis and
15:06
test which form was violated.
15:10
So as I described before um the weak
15:12
form test if markets are weak form
15:15
efficient you can't predict prices using
15:17
past trends or volume.
15:19
What we saw in this scenario is was that
15:22
there was a strong upward momentum.
15:25
prices kept rising day after day after
15:27
the initial jumps and we saw that in
15:29
some of the charts I created. Uh and
15:32
same for the huge volume spikes which
15:35
led to more buying the next day which
15:37
showed a feedback loop and then
15:40
retraders use it used past prices surge
15:43
to signal that they should buy more. So
15:47
from this we could see that the weak
15:48
form of efficiency was violated. The
15:51
past price movements or momentum did
15:53
predict future short-term gains allowing
15:56
trend following behavior not just a
15:58
random movement.
16:00
The behavioral explanation for this
16:01
would be that this pattern reflects
16:03
hurting overconfidence or fear of
16:05
missing out. The traders bought prices
16:08
uh bought because the prices were rising
16:10
not because any new technical
16:12
information was being released.
16:17
for the semi- strong test. If markets
16:19
are semi- strong efficient, prices
16:21
instantly adjust to new public
16:23
information. What we saw was that Ryan
16:26
Cohen joined the board and the stock
16:28
immediately jumped but kept rising for
16:30
days. And during the short squeeze,
16:34
prices surged far beyond the fundamental
16:36
value, $40 to $483.
16:41
And from the um cumulative abnormal
16:43
return chart from the code that we
16:45
generated, it showed that several days
16:47
of positive drift were happened after
16:50
the event. This means that semi- strong
16:53
efficiency was violated. The prices did
16:55
not immediately reach a stable or fair
16:59
value after the news was released.
17:01
Instead, they overreacted and drifted
17:03
upward for several days, which means
17:05
that information was slowly incorporated
17:08
or distorted by the hype.
17:11
The behavioral explanation for this was
17:13
that investors were influenced by social
17:15
media, Reddit and Twitter and
17:17
confirmation bias. They were chasing
17:19
narrative-driven trades instead of the
17:21
fundamentals. No financial analytics.
17:26
And then for the strong form, if markets
17:28
are strong form efficient, even insiders
17:30
can't beat the market because all
17:32
information public and private is
17:34
already priced in. What we saw was that
17:37
there is no clear evidence of insider
17:39
trading which drove this rally. Most of
17:42
the surge was public and transparent. Um
17:46
Reddit post, public filings and broker
17:48
restrictions was all um available to the
17:52
public and insiders like Ryan Cohen or
17:54
executive did not trade immediately
17:57
before major jumps.
18:00
Therefore, the strong form efficiency
18:01
was mostly upheld. There was no major
18:04
advantage was proven and efficiency came
18:06
from behavioral crowd effects not secret
18:09
information
18:12
and so well we can evaluate whether
18:14
rational investors could have profited
18:16
systematically.
18:19
So systematic profit means that earnings
18:23
that earning excess returns repeatedly
18:25
and predictably not by chance.
18:28
Rational investors are anybody any
18:30
professionals using data valuation risk
18:32
models not just their emotions.
18:37
So under an efficient market this
18:40
wouldn't be possible because prices
18:42
already reflect all information.
18:45
The rational investors could not
18:46
systematically profit from the GameStop
18:48
short squeeze. Although the stock was
18:50
clearly mispriced due to relative
18:52
relative to fundamentals, trading
18:54
crition conditions and borrowing costs
18:57
and volatility made arbitrage extremely
19:00
risky. Short sellers were forced out due
19:02
to unlimited losses while longside
19:05
traders faced an unsustainable amount of
19:07
momentum and massive downside risk. High
19:09
transaction costs and unpred predictable
19:12
timing prevented any consistent alpha.
19:14
Therefore, despite temporary
19:16
inefficiencies, rational investors were
19:18
unable to exploit them systematically,
19:21
illustrating the limits of arbitrage and
19:22
the role of behavioral forces in modern
19:25
market.
19:27
So, based on what we've talked about
19:29
before, the key idea here was that there
19:33
was
19:35
behavior and emotions
19:38
that came to play.
19:41
So finally we can compare the market
19:43
hypothesis predictions to observed
19:45
behavior.
19:48
So the efficient market hypothesis
19:50
predicts that prices should immediately
19:51
reflect all available information and
19:54
that investors cannot consistently
19:56
outperform the market. However, in the
19:58
GameStop short squeeze, this predict
20:00
contradicted these assumptions. Prices
20:03
continued long rising long after public
20:06
news driven by retail hurting and social
20:08
media momentum rather than new
20:10
information. As we said before, this
20:12
violated weak form and semi-runk
20:14
efficiency as trends in public data
20:17
produced abnormal returns for short
20:19
periods. Although the short for for uh
20:21
form remained intact, there was no
20:24
insider trading evidence. The event
20:26
proved that emotional and collective
20:28
behavior can temporarily temporarily
20:31
override rational price setting.
20:34
The observed anomalies highlight how
20:36
behavioral forces can create short-term
20:39
inefficiencies even when it within an
20:42
overall efficient market framework.
20:46
So prices moved in predictable patterns.
20:49
We had momentum which violated that weak
20:51
form. Traders bought a dip or follow
20:54
followed Reddit trends and profited in
20:56
the short term. Prices rove slowly days
20:59
after the board announcement and then
21:00
exploded weeks later due to the hype.
21:03
There was no insider trading. Rational s
21:06
short sellers like Melvin Capital could
21:08
not arbitrage due to extreme risks and
21:10
margin calls. This shows that there's
21:13
limits to arbitrage. Inefficiency
21:15
persisted by being obvious. We saw the
21:18
VA volume spike from social media hype,
21:20
not the the new information. So, we know
21:23
that it's behavioral trading, not
21:26
informational. There's abnormal shifts
21:28
that like returns uh abnormal returns
21:32
lasted several days and the car chart
21:34
chart showed persistent drift.
21:40
And finally, we can assess behavioral
21:41
finance explanations for observed
21:43
anomalies.
21:45
behavior fin uh finance explains the
21:48
GameStop anomalies more effectively than
21:50
traditional efficiency models. Hurting
21:53
and social media uh social influence
21:55
caused influ influencers to follow the
21:57
crowd rather than analyze any specific
21:59
values. Overconfidence and confirmation
22:02
bias amplified speculative behavior
22:04
while loss aversion delayed profit
22:06
taking even as prices crashed. These
22:09
biases produced extreme trading volumes,
22:11
sustained abnormal returns and delayed
22:13
price correction. all clear signs of
22:16
behavioral inefficiency. Ultimately, the
22:18
GameStop event illustrates that markets
22:21
are not purely rational. They are driven
22:23
by human emotion, social identity, and
22:25
cognitive bias.
22:27
And then again, we can the the specific
22:30
observed an anomalies
22:33
was momentum. prices kept rising which
22:36
is explained by hurting and
22:37
overconfidence creating the feedback
22:39
loop that I mentioned before
22:42
and that past winners continue winning
22:43
in the short term. We have the
22:45
post-event drift slow correction which
22:48
is confirmation bias delayed selling
22:51
loss aversion prevented exits. We have
22:53
extreme volatility and volume such as
22:56
hering FOMO and mental accounting drove
22:58
the excessive trading. We have
23:01
detachment from the fundamentals,
23:03
narrative investing and echo chambers
23:05
erode valuation logic.
23:11
We could finally move on to the
23:12
verification stage.
23:15
The first one we can do is some
23:16
statistical verification. We can answer
23:19
the questions are abnormal returns
23:21
significantly different from zero. In
23:24
our simulated GME example from the
23:27
Python code, the event AR is extremely
23:30
unlikely to occur occur by chance and
23:33
this confirms a signific statistically
23:35
significant reaction, not just some
23:37
random movement. We can also do some
23:40
economic verification and answer the
23:42
question that our profits la large
23:44
enough to overcome transaction costs and
23:48
during the GME event, transaction costs
23:50
and borrow rates are skyhigh.
23:54
And so even though abnormal returns
23:56
existed, economic significance was low
23:58
for rational investors because there was
24:00
real world frictions that erased
24:02
potential profit as well. We can we can
24:06
take a look at persistence. Real
24:07
inefficiency should not repeat across
24:10
time or similar stocks. But when
24:12
researchers test other stocks such as
24:14
AMC, Bed Batheon, and Blackberry, each
24:18
showed brief price surges and then a
24:20
rapid correction. So there was no
24:22
persistent strategy generated by a
24:24
repeated alpha
24:26
as well. Um we took a look at a bunch of
24:29
different um resources. We used Yahoo
24:31
Finance for historical prices, the CEC
24:34
staff report for short-term and interest
24:37
or short interest and volume and then
24:40
congressional testimony for timeline
24:41
accuracy.
24:45
And now we can move on to the evolve
24:46
stage. What are some things that we can
24:48
improve on moving forward? This project
24:52
can evolve into deeper studies of market
24:54
behavior, social sentiment, and investor
24:57
psychology. Future research could
24:59
explain the event study to include
25:01
multiple meme stocks. We could take uh
25:04
other scenarios similar to this or apply
25:06
textbased sentiment analysis to collect
25:08
ongoing discussions and trading
25:10
patterns. So we could take a look at
25:12
what kind of um discussions and insights
25:15
that these re Redditors are making their
25:17
decisions based on and then additional
25:19
valuation using statistical testing or
25:21
machine learning to test whether
25:23
behavioral signal signals predict
25:25
short-term price changes challenging the
25:27
weak form efficiency. These extensions
25:30
would transform the GameStop study from
25:32
a single case analysis to a broad
25:35
exploration exploration of human
25:37
behavior, social media, and technology
25:39
to reshape modern market efficiency.
25:44
And finally, we can move on to the
25:46
reflect stage. I just want to reiterate
25:49
some key points of this case study.
25:52
When it comes to market efficiency in
25:54
behavioral finance, it challenges the
25:56
notion of the market as always efficient
25:59
because here we had very public
26:01
information, heavy short interest and
26:04
yet extraordinary price behavior. It
26:07
shows how behavioral biases such as
26:09
hurting, limited attention, momentum,
26:12
plus structural structural friction such
26:14
as short borrow, clearing costs
26:16
influence the markets. We have both of
26:19
these things um coming to play. It
26:22
highlights that even a fundamental model
26:24
says that even if a fundamental model
26:27
says the stock is weak, other forces
26:29
such as social and technical can
26:31
dominate in the short term. From an
26:33
investment strategy perspective, it's a
26:36
reminder that active trading in these
26:38
extreme phenomena
26:39
is extremely risky. Profits may exist,
26:42
but so do large losses and
26:44
unpredictability.
26:46
This project showed that markets are
26:48
mostly efficient over time but can
26:50
temporarily uh can become temporarily
26:53
irrational when human behavior and
26:55
social dynamics take over. The EMH holds
27:00
long-term prices eventually return to
27:02
the fundamental value. Behavioral forces
27:04
dominate in the short term. Hurting and
27:06
FOMO create dramatic inefficiencies and
27:10
there are limits to arbitrage. Even
27:12
rational investors couldn't profit
27:14
systematically because of volatility,
27:16
risk, and restraints
27:18
constraints. Together, these insights
27:20
demonstrate that market efficiency isn't
27:22
just all or nothing. It's a spectrum
27:25
affected by information, speed, investor
27:28
behavior, and structural limits.
27:32
And finally, I'd like to touch on some
27:35
of the challenges of this case study. Um
27:37
the biggest challenge was really
27:39
verifying um historical price data and
27:42
correcting misinformation such as the $4
27:45
in 2020. Um because there's a lot of
27:48
information on this and some of them
27:50
might contradict each other. Um it took
27:52
a lot of research. And then
27:55
understanding the uh stock split
27:56
adjustments and how reported price
27:59
differ across sources required careful
28:01
checking with Yahoo Finance and CEC.
28:04
similar to what I just said. Um
28:07
again, there's a lot of research that
28:09
goes into um verifying some of the um
28:13
the timeline and the key data points as
28:16
well. Implementing the Python
28:17
calculations efficiently was a bit
28:19
difficult. Um it took a lot of research
28:23
on cumulative abnormal return and um
28:27
volume spike and what that all means.
28:29
And then quantifying psych psychological
28:32
factors using real data remains an
28:34
analytical challenge. Um a big part of
28:36
this project was really understanding um
28:40
investors
28:42
behavior and um it was a bit difficult
28:45
trying to explain that in an analytical
28:48
way.
28:50
So I hope I really touched on all the
28:52
different points and aspects of this
28:55
project and I hope you learned
28:56
something.

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone. Uh welcome to my driver analysis of uh GameStop uh GME market efficiency investigation. Um so let's begin uh the define and discover stage of of the driver framework. Uh the problem we're investigating is market efficiency. specifically whether the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 violated the efficient market hypothesis or if the price behavior can still be explained within existing theory. Uh the first requirement is to verify factual accuracy. One common misconception I found online and even in some some class materials is that GameStop traded at um 4 cents in August 2020. uh to that claim. Um in cell 2 uh and everything that I I used um I used with the help of uh Gemini to create this Python code for this assignment. Um so yeah, in cell 2 I ran a quick fact check using Yahoo Finance and uh Stamuse data. Uh GameStop actually closed around $167 on August 31st uh 2020, not 4 cents. that means that the statement is false and it's important to correct it politely. Um, for example, by citing verified data sources instead of just contradicting the claim. Um so yeah in cells one through three I set up the environment imported standard um Python finance libraries and downloaded historical data for both um

uh historical data for both GameStop and the the SNP uh 500 ETF um SPY uh starting August 2020 through the present uh these data sets will be the foundation for our uh efficiency analysis. All right. Um so yeah in uh let's move on to the represent stage. Um so the represent stage is where I translate the reason uh or translate the research question into a structured analytical framework. Um so in cell four I calculated daily simple log returns um for GM me and uh spy. Uh this converts raw price data into stationary time series suitable for uh statistical testing. Um cell five uh this this visualized the adjusted uh closing price and daily trading volume on a log scale. we can clearly see that the massive spike in both price and volume in January 2021 um characteristic of the short squeeze. Um so yeah and then in in cell six um I define key events uh event dates based on credible news milestones. Um, so like September 2020, Ryan Cohen stake announcement. Um, December 2020, early um, uh, Wall Street, that's buzz. Uh, January 28th, 2021, um, price peak and Robin Hood restrictions. February 2021 hearings. Uh, so these timestamps allow us to structure an event setting design around specific market reactions. All right, so let's move on to the implement stage. Um, so now that our framework is in place, uh, we move to the implementation stage. Uh, performing actual market efficiency testing. Uh, so in cell 7, I define a reusable function that estimates a simple CAPM regression over 120 um, day estimation window and computes uh, abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal uh returns in a plus or minus 10day event window. Um so yeah, and then in cell 8 uh applies this to January 28 or January 28 uh 2021 squeeze peak. Uh the model outputs an alpha and beta um uh roughly how GameStop moved relative to market risk before the event. Um so yeah the resulting abnormal returns show huge positive deviations during the squeeze period far beyond what CAPM would predict to test whether uh these cumulative abnormal returns are statistically significant. Cell 9 bootstraps C values and runs both t tests and empirical p values. The C remains highly significant suggesting semi- strong form inefficiency prices did not adjust purely based on uh fundamentals or publicly available information. Um so yeah in cell 10 I examine weak form efficiency. The autocorrelation function shows meaningful serial correlation and short-term returns and the jeong uh box test rejects the null of pure randomness. Um, cell 11 adds a variance to ratio check. Ratios deviate from one. Uh, again hinting that prices were not following a random walk during this extreme period. Um, finally in cell 12 uh sim it simulates a a simple buy and hold strategy from December 1st, 2020 to the January 28th, 2021 peak. uh that produced returns over several thousand uh%. Clearly an abnormal gain, but one that would have uh required ex um ex uh excente um prediction and tolerance for extreme volatility. Uh rational investors couldn't reliably capture this profit without um taking extraordinary risk or violating trading constraints. meaning expost profits do not necessarily refute efficient efficiency entirely. Um all right so let's validate um and in the the validate stage I check the the robust robustness of my findings. Um cell 13 runs two validation check uh um cell 13 runs two validation tests. Uh first a placebo event uh on an arbitrary um uh on an arbitrary October 2020 date. The C there is close to zero confirming our method doesn't produce false positives. Second, I repeat the event study with a longer estimation window to test sensitivity to uh parameter choice. The sign and magnitude of abnormal returns remain consistent. Um so these validations strengthen confidence that our observed and efficiency is tied to a genuine event driven uh behavior not statistical noise. Uh so let's evolve uh the evolve stage translates findings into theoretical and practical implications. So cell 14 I summarize the the key insights. The factual correction GameStop never traded at 4 cents. uh weak form uh inefficiency appeared through short-term predictability during the squeeze. Semi-rong inefficiency was evident because prices uh reacted dramatically to social media attention rather than fundamental news. uh expost profits existed but were accompanied by liquidity constraints and short selling restrictions aligning with behavioral finance and limits to our arbitrage uh explanations for an uh for investors. The episode um underscores why extreme events challenge passive management assumptions but do not fully invalidate EMH uh when viewed over long horizon. Um so yeah finally in the reflect stage um I consolidate the

the analytical process the the driver framework forced a disciplined workflow. I began with a clear problem definition and fact verification before any code execution. I represented the the research question using an event study structure. I implemented validated evolved and reflected systematically. Um so yeah cell 15 simply saves the script ensuring a reproductibility and uh code transparency uh a best practice in empirical financial uh research. So yeah, overall the GameStop cause or the GameStop case uh illustrates that markets can temporarily deviate from efficiency due to behavioral biases such as uh hurting overconfidence and attention um cascades amplified by social media. Yet over time, rational valuation anchors tend to reassert themselves consistent with a semi strong form of efficiency once the noise subsidi subsides. Um so yeah, this complete analysis therefore integrates both EMH and behavioral perspective satisfying all assignment requirements for financial accuracy uh technical imple impleation and driver process compliance. So, thank you guys for watching.",,0,1

00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello, so my
presentation is going to

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,680
investigate market
efficiency using the

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,040
GameStop short squeeze
of the 2020 to 2021

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,920
as a case study. So
I've used the driver

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,420
framework for this
analysis as required.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,420
So first, for
define and discover,

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,980
which is the first
step, the problem was

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,840
to test the efficient
market hypothesis

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,900
against the GME event.
So a critical first

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,440
step defined in the
assignment was to verify

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,620
a specific claim,
which was that GameStop

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,500
traded at four cents
in August in 2020.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,740
My research also
focused on answering the

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,260
key questions from the
rubric, which forms

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,500
of E&H were violated,
what behavioral

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,760
biases were at play,
and what role did limits

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,950
to arbitrage have in
this event. So, stage

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,240
two, which is represent.
The second stage

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,640
was to create my
analytical plan and this

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
had to be done before
my implementation.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,040
So my plan was to use
Python in the Google

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,820
CoLab notebook to
acquire data from Yahoo

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,540
Finance. I would then
use that data to first

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,760
verify the 4 cents
claim and second create

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,700
a visual event study
by plotting the price

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,720
and volume against
key event dates. and

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,560
this data would then
be used to answer the

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,120
analytical questions
so then on to implement

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,340
which starts right
here we move to the

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,580
implement stage
where i will execute

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,700
the python code so
first the code installs

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,200
and imports the
necessary data from

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,660
the yahoo finance
and all that and then

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,380
it filters the data
for august 2020 and

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,120
finds the lowest trading
price in that month

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,280
And then it generates
the main study

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,600
event bot, showing
price and volume,

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,540
with key dates like
the squeeze peak

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,940
and trading
restrictions labeled.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,340
So I will now
run the entire

41
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,320
notebook, which
I've already done,

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,560
but I will do
it again. The

43
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,550
code is executed,

44
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:23,420
see the output down
here, this chart, so

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,290
this is the chart, the
code generated this

46
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,190
is the primary data
that i will use for

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,630
my analysis in the
validate stage so you

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,810
can clearly see the
price and volume spikes

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,910
as well as the event
markers so on to

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,150
stage four which is
validate the fourth

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,570
stage um where i use
the code's output to

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,670
kind of answer my
answer the questions so

53
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,340
first a critical step
is that the code's

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,340
output shows the lowest
split adjusted price

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:12,550
in August 2020 was
$4.0150, so $4.01,

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,120
almost two. The
assignment's claim of only

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
four cents is therefore
factually inaccurate

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,820
by a factor of over
100. So second, the

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
test of the EMH forms.
Based on the chart,

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,320
the weak form was violated.
The clear momentum

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,740
bubble shows the
past price was used

62
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,560
to predict future price,
violating the random

63
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,640
walk idea. And the
semi-strong form was

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,140
also clearly violated.
The price soared to

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,020
$483, which we can
go back down to here.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,860
Okay, I'll just
see these spikes.

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,640
Which completely
disconnected from public

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
fundamental
information. The price

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,960
was driven by hurting
and social media,

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,420
not a rational
incorporation of data.

71
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,000
So, the limits to
arbitrage anomaly is what

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,760
I will be speaking
about next. So, rational

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,900
investors knew that
GMU was overpriced,

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,820
but they could not
correct it by shorting

75
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,300
the noise trader risk,
which is the risk

76
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,740
that the irrational
herd could keep pushing

77
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,620
the price up, and the
high cost to borrow

78
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,940
shares made shorting
impossible. So this is

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,280
what allowed the
inefficiency to persist.

80
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,140
And then on stage
five, which is evolve,

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,260
I analyze the
implications of this.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,540
So the event is strong,
is a strong argument

83
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,860
for passive
investing. So it shows

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,240
that trying these
speculative bubbles is

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,720
gambling, not a repeatable
active strategy.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,260
The event also
has major policy

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,400
implications as
it has highlighted

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,220
structural
market failures,

89
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,000
like trading
restrictions that

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,860
led to congressional
hearings.

91
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,280
And then we have the
last stage, which

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,720
is reflect. So
finally, in the reflect

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,740
stage, I can kind
of synthesize the

94
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,760
findings. So, in
conclusion, the GME event

95
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,450
is a textbook case
study where behavioral

96
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,240
finance provides
a much better

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,160
explanation than a
strict EMH framework.

98
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,940
It was a sentiment-driven
bubble and weaponized

99
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,740
by social media
that was allowed to

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,560
grow because limits
to arbitrage prevented

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,060
rational correction.
so and it proves that

102
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,500
while markets may be
mostly efficient they

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,940
are not always rational
and this is the rest

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,620
and that just concludes

105
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,000

",FALSE,1,"Hello there. I'm Joe Dragoni from your management 310 class and this is my session 8 assignment looking at market efficiency of the GameStop stock. So just a little bit of overview about our investigation we're going to be going into for now. So we are investigating market efficiency using GameStop. The game short short squeeze um the big event where GameStop stock surged to very high returns from 2020 and it was in early 2021 that it had the super high returns. Um so we're just going to be looking at the price behavior relative to the efficient market hypothesis predictions. Um then one of the first steps we'll be going into is um verifying the statement of GameStop trading at 4 cents in August of 2020 against the historical data which we'll go into in a second. Um and then we'll look at the event timeline of August 2020 where GameStop was nearing bankruptcy levels. September 2020 where Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, acquired 30% stake. um January 2021, the big event where Wall Street Bets, Reddit, um subreddit drove the price um up to $483 a share as led by Roaring Kitty um in February 2021 after that event, congressional hearings about market manipulation and the stabilization of the price of GameStop uh post event I'm looking at today. So some other key points to look at is the short interest peaked at 100 140% a float. Retail trading volume increased 10fold during the squeeze. Um trading restrictions implemented at the peak by Robin Hood after they saw what happened with the influence of the Reddit account to have people invest in that stock. Um hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 53% loss and analyst fundamental value estimates being $10 to $40 per share. So now some required analysis some points we'll be looking at over the course of this video being verifying historical price data and document corrections testing which form of market efficiency was violated whether it was weak semi- strong or if all of them were violated evaluating whether rational investors could have profited systematically comparing efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior. So the real behavior that we saw compared to the hypothesis predictions and then assessing behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies and then we'll do all of this using the driver framework. So the first stage of the driver framework the define and discover stage looking at our goal of investigating market efficiency of gametock from 2020 to 2021 um the event timeline that we went over already and verifying the facts stated in the problem. So just kind of going into that goal a little bit deeper. Um we want to determine whether the 2021 short squeeze of GameStop constitutes definitive anomaly that invalidates the efficient market hypothesis or if it can be explained as a rare and rational though very extreme as we saw market event driven by market structure and new forms of information flow aka social media. And did the market behave efficiently or were there behavior behavioral factors involved? So basically we're just trying to determine if efficient market hypothesis is still a valid model for understanding financial markets in the modern age of social media and widespread retail trading. some actions we'll take um using assistance from AI a little mostly Google Gemini a little bit of CHBT um as well as historical data and learnings of the um efficient market hypothesis as well as past concepts from this class like CAPM to analyze GameStop investment and understand certain anomalies can provide evidence against market efficiency. Um do the events of the timeline have anything to do with the price jump? um and then testing the form of market market efficiency that was violated. Um so looking at what the different forms of efficient market hypothesis here in this define and discover stage just to make sure we understand the financial concepts from this lesson. Um weak form um efficient market hypothesis is that price prices reflect all past price and volume information and technical analysis does not work to provide new information for investing. semi-trong form um EMH uh where the prices reflect all publicly publicly available information. So fundamental analysis doesn't work to get an edge over the competition for investing. And then strong form EMH is the price reflect all information including private information um that companies or market insiders might have. So insider trading doesn't work which insider trading is normally illegal. So this wouldn't help anyway. Um, and then kind of looking at that critical first step we talked about already about whether GameStop traded at 4 cents per share in August of 2020. So, just to kind of validate this claim, I used Yahoo Finance, pulled up GameStop, and looked at the entire history of GameStop stock. As we can see here, starting in 2002, um, there it was mostly the returns mostly close to or they were in single digits. um you know back when the rise of games um physical copies of games were popular it was it maybe rose a little bit around 2013 you know when the Xbox came out or when there were physical copies of games being sold and then as games started to go digital it went closer to bankruptcy levels as we validated and the stock price just continued to decrease but looking at August 2020 or 8 of 2020 we can see here that the open price was $11. Closing price is $167 and the low was a dollar and then the high was$1 179. So we can see here that that claim of GameStop being shared at 4 cents um in August of 2020 is false. So we can verify that with historical figures which we did with Yahoo Finance. Um we saw looking at the beta was negative 1.3 um at that time which means it moves opposite to the market. So, it had a negative correlation, which means it just continued to go down, but was not quite at that 4 cent range. Um, it may have been a calculation error, miscommunication error that made the professor think this. Um, and yeah, just the way we can communicate that error that was found is just, you know, using our voice in class to talk about this error or sending an email to the professor. Moving down to the represent stage. Um like we said the goal here of this stage um you know ma mapping out visualizing mentally timeline of events and how the returns reflected the change in the timeline. Um and then looking at the systematic approach to testing market efficiency. Um and this can help us to see abnormal returns drift and any other key factors we need to analyze. So kind of looking at the short squeeze or what a short squeeze is um that of what happened in 2021. Um, it's a short squeeze is when many investors short the same stock and the stock's price starts rising unexpectedly. So, in the case of the Wall Street Bets Reddit subreddit, um, uh, led by Roaring Kitty, um, a guy on with the Reddit username that and also had a YouTube account named after that. he was releasing videos about that stock on YouTube and caused a whole influx both on Reddit and on YouTube of people to invest in the stock to drive up the price causing a short squeeze and the stock to increase by hundreds of dollars a share. So then validating the timeline of the stock which I used with this uh the street.com looking kind of at the timeline of events that was given to us. So, you know, starting in August 2020, we see the end of August 2020, the games, I guess maybe there was insider information about Ryan Cohen um wanting to purchase some shares of GameStop. Um so, the price was going up to 668 at the end of the month, even though we already looked it was around a dollar. Um, and then just going through the different information about Ryan Cohen before he before the short squeeze of Roaring Kitty, which happened in January of 2021. Um, as you can see here, it happened right here on the 27th. Um, getting the short squeeze around $300, $380 up to around the $400 range. So we can see that we saw like we said already August 2020 um GM the GME was nearing bankruptcy levels in September of 2020 Ryan Cohen acquires the stake of of the company um buying shares outstanding. Um the Reddit accounts surged the price to $483 in January of 2021. February of 2021, the congressional hearings on market manipulation and then the postvent postevent price stabilization which like we saw here after the super high spike in the price in 2021. The stock has gone down to more normal levels. There were a couple it's still higher than it was before the bankruptcy levels but still stabilized a little bit. Um and then so that's just validating the timeline and then looking at the return calculations. Um what we're going to use in our implementation stage just kind of drawing those calculations out. Looking at normal returns, abnormal returns and then cumulative abnormal returns. So normal returns um is the expected return on a stock if the event had not occurred. So that would be the average return plus the systematic risk times the market return on day t. Um then the abnormal returns calculation would be um just the difference between the actual observed return and the normal or expected return. So the abnormal returns um if it's higher than the expected return that chunk between the observed return and the normal return will be what our abnormal return was. And then you know if normal is greater than the observed then we'll have a negative abnormal return. Um just showing that we actually observed less than what we predicted to be and then the car or cumulative cumulative abnormal returns being the total abnormal return over a defined period. So after calculating the abnormal returns for a bunch of different days or time periods summing all those up over the course of the event which we'll do in our implementation stage. So now going down to implementation. Um I had help from Google Gemini to debug it in um collab because it wasn't working after generating it in actual Gemini. So there's a lot to go through here. It made some changes here. Um but get the market data. It has the ticker of here at least. I have a few cells of implementation here that you'll see in a second. But Gamestock compared to GameStop compared to the stock of the S&P 500 as a market proxy. Um, and then the different dates they started the squeeze just the very beginning of it in January and then the initial 13% stake that Ryan Cohen bought in the company. So just to run it to make sure that it works um see the check there. we go down to look at well first we'll look at this visualization that we made between the um starting in 2019 all the way up to 2022. So there's three years of looking at the comparison between the benchmark the S&P 500. You can see this drop here due to CO 19 around March as we all know that was not good for the market. Um but just the constant um increase and rebuild of the S&P 500 after that. And then down here, this blue line shows the low returns or low low closing price of GameStop and then the crazy price increase, the price hike to around $8 a share then and then how it decreased back to stabilize out before rising back up again. Um but still we see how that uh the event in the market um or the restrictions on trade caused the drop the decrease back to low returns after the price hike um seen from the short squeeze. But looking up to what we actually were or what we actually want to know um the efficiency test that we calculated from the um September of 2020 and the January of 2021 um just looking at the cumul cumulative abnormal returns that we calculated from the pre-event the day of the event and the postevent drift um we see we get 42% or 0.42 42 drift um from day 20 to day one negative one which is leading up to the event before um Ron Cohen invested in the stock then the event day being negative so a drop in the drift um and then the postevent drift being 69 so or not 69 that's just the total over the whole window on the postvent drift being 33%. And then as you can see we got just shows relative days to the stock just just a quick head of the change there. Um how the market return compared to the stock return the actual returns here um reflect you know not very large numbers um still only like 1 to 2% not even 1% someday and sometimes it's dropping by a percent sometimes it's raising by a percent point. Um but then the abnormal returns you know um are a bit higher over time and then just the cumulative average returns or abnormal returns on average returns being in um daily being around the 13 to 20 or not 13 to 20 12% to 20% range. Um just to get an idea for how this code works. And then going looking at the next event being the first um January of 2021 and days leading up to the event that happened there. Um you know we see this is still a little bit before the actual short squeeze but we can see you know leading up to that there was negative drift. Then the day of um the actual start of the short squeeze it was 56% drift. And then days after that we see almost 200% here because 2.54 200% drift. So it's just showing reflecting the actual short squeeze there and the efficiency and kind of leads us to think about what is actually driving this. So again, here are the um the event window data just showing you know days leading up to or this is this time it's showing days postevent um but still showing the much higher returns market returns normal returns and the abnormal returns and then um 300% 200 yeah just around 300% um for these for the cumulative abnormal returns just showing super high returns there and And then just looking at the next I made another couple of graphs to actually show the short squeeze um abnormal returns in a graph. So run this. Um this is the actual event day of the short squeeze or the day after when the trade restrictions were imposed uh with Robin Hood. So just 20 days before 20 days after we see this graph here um shows how you know these days were nearing bankruptcy or the returns were not that good and then around 13 days before the short stock it had started to rise and um as more and more people were investing in the stock and searching the price to this to its peak of the abnormal returns of you know almost to 300% about 2.75 2.8% 8% looks like up here was the peak. Um, just showing that crazy spike in the abnormal returns. Um, and then right here on this red line, the day after was when the trade restrictions were imposed. Um, and people were beginning to sell their stocks because Robin Hood was letting people sell their stocks um for a short period of time but not letting people more people buy into the stock. Um and then just the days after showing the stabilization of the stock. We're not it's not quite the stabilization period yet, but um having less returns as more and more people are selling their stocks and the stock is not becoming as valuable from the squeeze anymore. Um as well as some of the federal um mediation as well. And then just one more graph that I made to actually show the same graph that we saw already but the dayby-day with the bars here the dayby-day cumulative or daily not cumulative daily abnormal returns. So as we see from day to day starting from -20 to15 or the days leading up to the event it was mostly negative to the most part. People weren't really gaining money on the stock until you know around the short squeeze started and the returns began to increase by a lot up until the point of the event. Um and then the day of as people were starting to sell the stock the abnormal returns were decreasing. Just a cool thing to cool graph to look at. Um, now we move on to the validation stage here. Um, like we said, looking above the graph of the benchmark versus the game stop shows negative correlation of betas because kind of looking back up here real quick, we see as this is rising, this is sort of decreasing or just staying stable. Um, so game like we said, GameStock had a negative beta. Um, benchmark S&P500 has a beta of 1.0. So it just shows, you know, this one at this time of the spike had a lot of volatility. Um, and then just began to or be began becoming more volatile but going in the wrong direction. Um, going back down to validation stage. Um I mean we already compared the calcul uh figures calculated online research. Um and then another way to validate our answers was with stat statistical significance and robustness checking. So a way to calculate statistical statistical significance rather sorry um you know looking at are the abnormal returns significantly different from zero. Um so the period we tested um was from the days 20 days before the event happened to 20 days after. So to calculate our t value here for our t statistic we did cumulative cumulative abnormal returns divided by the standard error um or yeah divided by the standard error over the or not overly this should this should be times standard error of the abnormal returns times the square root of the amount of days. So 40 days total gives us our t statistic. And I had Jim and I do these calculations for us. And we saw that during this event window, the t stat t statistic was very high. Sorry, I cannot talk tonight. And the p value um was a lot less than um 0.001 or alpha here. So abnormal returns are large and significant meaning that the event almost certainly caused the stock's price to move or the um social media influence and overconfidence hurting um all those behavioral factors influenced by the Reddit posting and YouTube video of Roaring Kitty cause the stock to move. Um and then looking at just a risk adjustment as well are normal or are abnormal returns compensation for additional risk. The abnormal returns seen during the GameStop squeeze were not rational compensation for additional risk. And we know this because behavioral factors and social media communication drove up price. Um and you know these people investing were not looking for extra risk. They were just trying to make a statement as we looked at and a lot of people you know thought this was an opportunity to make some extra profit but as we saw it was not really in a systematic way. It was in you know sort of a way of rigging the market to try and beat the market and make a statement. Um returns really temporary result of speculative of a specul speculative bubble and a market structure failure um as well as manipulation like we talked about already. So, a way to test robustness of this check would be run with a larger time period or a different time period rather than the 40-day one that we used. Um, and maybe doing a sensitivity analysis as well. Um, I talk about robustness checks as well in the evolve stage. But this is what I have for the validation stage. So, moving down to evolve. um you know doing what we did here in or what I did in the stages you applying these efficiency insights to the different market anomalies and market biases. So looking at the behavioral biases here um you know a lot of these did apply to this situation um and caused the price to drive up and show why it wasn't why we weren't dealing with systematic risk but it was an more of an unsistatic way of dealing with it. So overconfidence um like we said the investors on Wall Street Bets subreddit became overconfident in their collective ability to beat Wall Street. Um and then yeah both sides the retail and institutional sides in January of 2021 both displayed overconfidence um which amplified the volatility of the stock. um for anchoring. This was definitely another big part of the short squeeze as investors may have anchored on GameStop's historical low prices. Um and this caused irrational price expectations and poor timing decisions during and after the peak. um for hurting large numbers of retail investors followed this RW wall street vets communities momentum without conducting individual valuation analysis which arguably is the most significant part of the short squeeze because you know a lot of people were following the social media posts uh the YouTube videos the subreddit um memes and screenshots as well of the large profits triggered um by the short squeeze and this caused you know fear of missing out um and more people, you know, even as the price was going up more and more, people were buying even more to the point because they wanted to, you know, make this short-term profit off of the stock, especially using Robin Hood. Um, it wasn't the price was moving not because everyone else was buying, but because of new information here. And then loss aversion after prices fell from the $400 highs. uh investors refused to sell at a loss, holding on to their hopes of another rally um after they invested, you know, thousands and thousands of dollars into it. Um and you know, this kept long-term and short-term investors in positions far longer than rational analysts would suggest, which worsened volatility, worsened volatility. Um then for market mental accounting, you know, retail traders viewed GameStop investments as fund money or a statement against Wall Street, not as part of a rational portfolio. Um and this reduced sensitivity to risk encouraging irrationally high exposure to a single volatile volatile stock which in turn hurt the rest of the market. Um and had to or had to res or it didn't have to it did result in a government intervention. Um then you know some of the market anomalies that we looked at kind of seeing if those aligned with what happened with this investment story. Um looking at momentum Gamestock was not looking was not doing well before. So the sudden change in the earnings does not quite align with this concept or at least not until the short squeeze start. Um as trading was accelerated by algorithmic trading and social media amplification creating self-fulfilling cycle when prices attracted more buyers for the value effect. Um investors like Ryan Cohen when he invested in the stock saw long-term valuing long-term value in restructuring the company's e-commerce strategy because of its low trading levels. Um and after January 2021 the price was no longer driven by fundamentals or intrinsic worth but by speculative and behavioral forces. So in turn this negated the value effect. Um so so far momentum and value effect do not apply to this. Um the size effect here the small size made it more susceptible to volatility. um retail coordination and short squeezes um which we saw with the Wall Street bets um and all of the followers investing in the stock. So it was more vulnerable to price manipulation and momentum shocks and um it was easier for the group to manipulate it. So the size effect does is amplified there. Um and then the January effect looking at smaller stocks doing better in January. Um which we did see that this smaller stock or this lower price stock had its short squeeze in January but um you know this was with the help from the Reddit group that manipulated the value and drove up the price. So the drivers of price were different um being short squeeze and social coordination rather than the seasonal behaviors of this effect. So then just um another way to improve robustness here um or how to expand this analysis is like we talked about already using a longer pre-event period maybe like 120 250 days um of trading before the event window rather than only single or double digit events event single or double digit event amount dates. So we could also test with the cap model to strengthen our argument that the results are not model specific if the abnormal returns persist. So branch to other concepts that we've learned in management 310 already could help us to strengthen our argument as well. So like doing a cap model and then like we looked at the comparison of gametock to the benchmark to compare the betas of the two stocks um or the two you know the market to the stock um we could try a different market industy like the NASDAQ composite to test sensitivity analysis or perform a sensitivity analysis to further strengthen our argument. So now for our last part, the reflection stage um last part of driver some of the things that I took away from this assignment and what I've learned or the key takeaways that could be taken away from this um like we saw the market is mostly efficient unless a factor like something behavioral or arbitrage or collusion messes with it. Um, like we said, the we went over the behavioral biases and the market biases from above or the market anomalies from above. And this shows how those factors can drive up stock prices temporarily. Specifically, the behavioral biases. Um, looking at abnormal return, it reflected the difference between what GameStop's actual returns were and what the expected earnings were from the model. Um you know like before GameStop's um expected returns were very low being close to bankruptcy levels but um you know the short squeeze here showed the price drift that can be used to determine efficiency. Um so you know just kind of looking at the short squeeze and seeing how the different types of efficiency um using the efficient market hypothesis could have been violated which we'll go into in just a second here. um you know could rational investors have profited systematically from this. The price increase was not driven up naturally or by new information but rather um hurting the social coordination etc. Um and we did see some investors profit from this. You know some were smart to sell their stocks as it was keeping before you know Robin Hood stopped accepting profits or buys of the share and before there was government intervention from Congress. Um but uh the systematic and rational profit was extremely unlikely as this you know this wasn't done systematically or um by knowledge by one's own knowledge but rather by the social influence from the Reddit. Um and the short squeeze was highly unpredictable market frictions and trading restrictions from Robin Hood after the event. Um we saw the high volatility of the stock undermines the systematic strategy um because it was highly volatile after the short squeeze. Um and then just kind of going over the results of the market efficiency form testing. Um we saw the weak form market efficiency was not directly violated because the rise was not a repeatable not a repeatable thing to happen um because you know government won't let it happen anymore. rather it emerged from new non-pricreatelated factors um both social and structural um as they found a loophole within the system. The semi-rong form was violated as non-fundamental information aka the Reddit discussions created irrational mispricing inconsistent with semi-rong efficiency and strong form market efficiency was violated as market constra limited limited arbitrage capacity revealed that all information was not instantly or equally reflected in the prices. So then just some last key takeaways as this is a very long video. I apologize. Um but just to sum everything up, EMH holds in theory but weakens under social and structural strain. Behavioral anomalies can cause temporary inefficiency but markets will eventually return to normal as seen with GameStop today. Just kind of looking at that looking back at Yahoo Finance. It's at you know $21.32 today. Um and it is not at it super high level but it's again not at you know bankruptcy levels anymore but still went down and still looks to be super volatile. Um and then just last thing a market can be efficient on average but still experienced short bursts of chaos in his pricing as we saw with this. Um although it's unlikely now after this the lesson that was learned from all parties from this story this chaotic series of events it likely won't happen again but the market can still be efficient on average u even if some of these things happen. So, thank you for watching this very long video and yeah.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, this is my market efficiency investigation of GameStop GME using the driver framework. I'm going to test weak form, semi- strong, and strong form EMH. I'm going to compute the abnormal returns using a CA PM event study and analyze volume and predictability and evaluate behavioral finance limits to arbitrage and market micro structure. And I'm also um just kind of build on those things. So first fact is verification the statement GameStop traded at. Okay. So here three app parameters and events. I'm going to define the analysis window for mid 2020 to today. the tickers GME and spy which is the market proxy and the event dates and then we're going to go over here to the CAPM event study. So, this is just going to lay out my event study, the expected return model, the CAPM, and for each event, I'm going to estimate a alpha and b beta over a 250day estimation window ending um 30 days before the event. And that's all detailed in number seven over here. Um, and so for reform efficiency, I'm going to test return predictability um and use the OS formula. And I'm also gonna evaluate volume standard by it 60-day average. Um so now I'm going to download GME and spy closes and spy closes and compute daily returns and create standardized volume. Um this is going to set up prices, returns and volume for the event study. And this function is going to fit CAPM um that outputs AR C series plus alpha beta R squar and a mean AR T statistic over that window. And then we're going to run the events. And here I'm going to loop over the four events 13D 13D/ A peak slash the restrictions and hearing. And so for each event, I'm going to plot the abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, and a volume over 60-day average. And these visuals are going to kind of reveal information um incorporation and kind of hurting the um hurting and like attention spikes. And so now I'm going to run lung box at lags um May 10th 2020 to test serial correlation and the one lag OS for predictability and this table over here summary is going to print alpha beta r 2 it's t statistic and uh cir for quick vidation and so around giant so we're going to go through our AR and C plots here. And so around January 28th, 2021, um the peak restrictions um were large in magnitude and consistent with the short-term market um anomaly. And around coins 13D, 13D/A, there's this typically strong positive CIR consistent with semi- strong efficiency. Um so public information is rapidly incorporated. And the p values here from the lung box are here in the output. Um they don't show persistent correlation and the one lag regression slope is near zero which is insignificant. And that means we form efficiency largely holds very little predictability in daily returns almost zero actually. Um, and so now I'm showing the volume over 60-day charts around the January 28th window. So volume standard by 60-day average spikes to extreme levels. Um, which is textbook attention and hurting behavior. And so from an investor profitability perspective, um, profit opportunities were not reliable Xanti. Um you know riskadjusted returns are very poor for repeatable rules once you consider you know short sale constraints, borrow fees, hall risk and execution limits which are the classic limits to arbitrage and also market microstructure issues like clearing house, collateral demands and trading prescriptions. These are all why this locations um persisted briefly. And so here's the summary table. And weak form EMH um holds no return predictability from our test. Semi-strong EMH mostly holds it. Prices respond quickly to public information. And um temporary overshoots are consistent with behavioral finance and you know other frictions from micro structure, not a wholesale EMH failure. And strong foreign EMH does not hold. Um not all private information is reflected in prices and so behavioral biases were on display you know hurting uh overconfidence uh lottery preferences and different attention cascades. So policy implications and theoreticalations support that shorter settlement cycles and more transparency on maybe collateral mechanics for investing. The balance still favors passive management. Um, more conservative while active strategies may occasionally exploit dislocations and face capacity and risk restraints. So that completes my driver um with CAPM of normal returns event study, volume analysis, predictability tests and a balanced EMH versus behavioral finance assessment. Thank you so much for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, this is Mauricio. In Session 8, I keep thinking about this frustrating problem I ran into: I built a valuation model and decided a stock let's call it NeuroLink Robotics is worth around $48 per share, but the market is trading it at $210. So now I'm stuck asking myself if I'm missing something obvious, if the market is running on pure hype, or if markets are really this strange mix of spreadsheets, emotions, and groupthink. That's the tension between market efficiency and behavioral finance, and I'm going to walk through how I make sense of it using DRIVER.

Define & Discover First, I try to translate the mess into normal words. My core question is whether I can trust the market price or if prices sometimes swing far from fair value. To approach that, I revisit the Efficient Market Hypothesis weak, semi-strong, and strong and connect each form to real types of investors like people who rely on chart patterns, people who read financial statements, and people who simply dollar-cost average into the S&P. I also bring in behavioral finance to understand how herding, panic, overconfidence, and biases can distort prices. Overall, I'm trying to figure out when I should assume the price is probably right and when there might be genuine opportunities to outperform.

Represent Next, I turn these ideas into simple mental pictures instead of scattered definitions. I restate EMH in plain language: the weak form says past price data is already reflected; the semi-strong form says public information is already priced in; and the strong form claims even insider information is reflected, which clearly doesn't match reality. Then I imagine an event study around a NeuroLink announcement. I think in three periods before the event, the event day, and after comparing the stock's expected return to its actual return to find abnormal returns. In a semi-strong efficient market, the big jump should happen immediately, not slowly over several days. I also layer behavioral finance on top, recognizing that herding, anchoring, overconfidence, and loss aversion can all push prices away from fundamentals.

Implement For implementation, I picture a simple Python simulation. I imagine simulating daily market returns around NeuroLink's announcement window, using beta to estimate the stock's normal return, then adding a large positive shock on the event day. I might also add a slow drift afterward if the market underreacts or overreacts. After that, I calculate abnormal returns and total them up, focusing on how much of the reaction occurs on the announcement day versus later. If most of it is immediate, that supports efficiency; if not, it suggests behavioral biases or slow information processing.

Validate Then I sanity-check whether any pattern I see is real or just noise. I ask whether the abnormal returns are statistically significant, whether they are economically meaningful after transaction costs and risks, and whether the effect persists across different stocks or time periods. If the effect disappears once I include realistic costs or only shows up in a small, specific sample, it's likely not a viable strategy but just randomness that happens to look interesting.

Evolve At this point, I update how I think markets work. I conclude that big, liquid markets are mostly efficient, especially for mature companies or routine news. But they are not perfectly efficient, especially when the story is complicated, investors are overloaded, or the stock is caught in a hype cycle. That leads me to build strategies that use passive investing as a foundation while taking careful, evidence-based active positions only where I think there is a persistent edge.

Reflect Finally, I think about what this means for me as an analyst. I can't automatically assume the market is wrong just because my model disagrees, and I can't blindly trust my model either. EMH reminds me that prices usually reflect information I don't fully see, while behavioral finance reminds me that real people panicked, overconfident, emotional are behind trades. 

My takeaway from Session 8 is that I shouldn't blindly trust the market or my model; instead, I should treat the market price as a strong starting point but remain open to real inefficiencies, especially in hype-driven situations where behavior can overpower fundamentals.

",FALSE,1,"Hello, this is my session 8 assignment for financial management. So let's go ahead and get started here. Today we're talking about GameStop, specifically in a short squeeze era.
Using market efficiency theory, behavioral finance and rational investor analysis. First, before I get into my results, I wanted to go over my driver kind of prompts. My first prompt was I am beginning to define and discover stage market efficiency investigation using GameStop.
2021 or 2020 to 2021 short squeeze as the event. I wanted to find the analytical problems, including correcting the claim that GME was traded at four cents in August of 2020.
Key efficiency questions that I needed to investigate what other data sets were required and what unknowns or assumptions must be clarified before designing an event study approach. Made sure to tell it not to jump to analysis to stay strictly within the define and discover stage.
Next I moved on to the represent, so it prompted it as I am now moving to the represent stage of the driver framework based on the define and discover outputs. So I'll get into the actual asking AI this. I just wanted to show my prompts before I went in because there was a lot of text and it'd take a while to scroll through.
Everything, but for the represent stage I prompted it as based on the define and discover outputs, help me design an analytical plan studying GameStop's market efficiency. It should include the proposed event windows and estimation window for an event study variables needed.
Like returns, abnormal returns, CAPM metrics, volume, short interest, etcetera. Proposed tests for EMH, weak, sem, strong and strong. Behavioral finance hypothesis is to test.
Motations or risks and etcetera. Next for the implement stage, I asked that using the represent plan to help me execute the empirical steps gathering historical GameStop prices from August 2020 to.
I changed this to August.
Of 2022, calculating market returns, computing abnormal returns, identifying event windows and seeing if it kind of was predictable. Next validate. I'm now on the validate stage driver helped me test the robustness and statistical significance of my findings. It should include T tests.
Checking sensitivities, alternate with event windows, comparing capital market versus market adjusted returns, verifying data accuracy and correcting false claims and to ensure that this is focused on validation, not interpretation.
Next for the evolve stage, based on validated empirical results, help me derive practical implications, what the evidence suggests about EMH form violations, what David implies for rational investor strategies and limits to arbitrage exposed to the GME squeeze.
And how behavioral forces interacted with the market. That was a big part of it. And then reflect. I need you to guide me through the driver framework, define, discover, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect for a market efficiency analysis of the 2020 to 2021 GameStop shorter squeeze at each stage only perform what we are currently in.
And ask for clarification before moving on. OK, so those are my prompts. I'm gonna take you to this is the summarized version of it. So yeah, we're studying market efficiency. We clarify the analytical problem of verifying facts.
Like GME was never traded at four cents in August of 2020, which I pulled from Yahoo Finance. We can see all of the lows for each day of 2020. We'll specifically go to August. Here we can see that looking through this.
Stops here. None of these values are at four cents, so it's trading at around $1.50.
To a dollar, dollar to $1.50. So that proves the point that it never traded at four cents then. But yeah, so.
EMH was kind of relevant. It pretty much.
Well, GameStop was traded around $4.00 a share in July of 2028 and searched 1900% in 2021 alone, which was crazy. Here's my tests. It was semi-strong public short interest reached over 130% on the flow and as peak was estimated above 140.
4%, meaning some more shares were shorted than existed. So more people were trying to short it than actual shares there were, which is which is crazy. The thing about insider information explained the price jump for from 20 to over 480.
So that just shows that it wasn't really, there was no insider information that would have caused it to jump that much. That's a 2300% increase in two weeks, which is unheard of. Yeah, so we'll go over the timeline.
Short interest above 100% existed for months without any major price movement, which is interesting. The stock reacted when Reddit discussion volume increased 20 times during January. At the peak, GameStop's volume hit 100 and ninety-seven million shares more than 15 times its.
Flow showing how sentiment, not fundamentals, drove price action, which means pretty much the people investing drove price. It was kind of built around hype in social media. So we'll get into a little bit about the abnormal returns in the event from January 12th to January 28th.
GameStop rose from $20 to $480. That's 22 percent, 2200% in 16 days. Using the cap in estimate, normal expected returns would predict maybe 1 to 2% per week, which is not.
2200 which is shows that the cap M didn't really do it. Like it didn't really show it didn't work. During the squeeze period, the accumulated abnormal return exceeded 1500%. After the peak, the price fell 87% in less than two weeks. The boom and bust pattern is.
Palladed with efficient pricing. So GameStop was extremely inefficient and it got exploited momentum. So once the stock doubled from 20 to 40, it kind of kept compounding on itself and people kept seeing, oh, GameStop's going higher, higher and higher. So this kind of.
Got this crowd-driven kind of hype around it, and it pushed the price all the way to $480, which is unheard of. It's all based off of hype.
Yeah, so behavioral biases hurting millions of retailers converged to the same trade. The number of retail brokerage accounts holding GameStop increased by over 400% in a single month. Overconfidence. Many traders believed that they would get rich quickly despite the volatility.
Exceeding 600% annualized, which means the market moves a dollar and GameStop moves.
What, $600? Which is or not 600, but $6? So it's one to six, which is it's very volatile either way.
So the whole narrative behind this was beat Wall Street, beat the hedge funds, all that. So that was kind of also hurting people and this kind of mob mentality of, oh, everybody buy GameStop and short it. Yeah, so.
Yeah, limits to arbitrage. GameStop showcased extreme constraints for rational traders. Short sellers lost over $6 billion in the squeeze. Some borrowers fees reached up to 80 to 100% annually. Several funds like Melbourne Capital lost more than 50% of their assets in January alone.
Mispricing can persist when arbitrage becomes too risky, and that's exactly what happened. Market microstructure issues. Several structural issues amplified the squeeze on January 28, some brokers restricted buying.
This was a big deal, kind of. They took it off the market so you couldn't trade it, which was because they thought people were kind of manipulating the market, which is illegal. So there was profit opportunities. Some early traders turned $1000 into 20,000 and 50,000.
More most traders who entered after the spike experience lost it losses. Um, I actually have a.
Picture of short squeeze. So all the way up and then all the way down. So the people that bought lost a lot of their money. People shorted, kind of lost some money when it went up like the hedge funds. So that's that was our whole goal was to beat the hedge funds, beat Wall Street. So they all shorted it.
Well, um.
All the hedge funds shorted it and everybody drove the price up and that pretty much just made the hedge funds lose all their money. Yeah, so the represent stage.
Yeah. So we'll go back to here. Yeah, daily price swings are 100 to 150% either way. Multiple days where, like I said, they halted trading, nobody was allowed to buy it. There was no private information at edges, so this wasn't oh, somebody.
Somebody had information that nobody else had. It was pretty much people just got lucky. It was like gambling. But you could kind of know because social media played a massive impact in it. If you were in the right groups, you could tell when something was going to happen.
OK, EMH versus behavioral finance. The GameStop saga strongly supports behavioral finance models. EMH simply cannot explain the 2000 plus rise in struggling retailer within two weeks. That was another big thing was GameStop wasn't a super.
Established brand, they were kind of falling off, they had plateaued and they were going down the deep end. So 2000% rise and that is it can't be explained other than people were buying the hype.
But yeah, so wrapping up GameStop short squeeze wasn't just a market event. It was a massive intersection of investor psychology, technology, social coordination, market structure. It challenged classical market theory, validated behavioral finance insights and left lasting implications for traders.
Players in financial theory. But yeah, thanks for watching and I hope it made the GameStop event clearer and more meaningful and grounded in real data. So that was all I had. Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Hello. Today I will be presenting a financial analysis of the GameStop short squeeze event, as a case study in market efficiency. So, I'll of course be using the DRIVER method framework to guide this investigation, and we'll have a final reflection at the end and the event's implications for the financial theory.

So, let's of course start off with the Discover and Design. So, in the first stage here, we're going to define the problem. So, let's skip down to here where our objective is to investigate uh GameStop event to determine if it violated the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and to identify behavioral, excuse me, the behavioral finance concepts at play and assess if any rational or systematic profit opportunities existed. Excuse me, my throat's very dry at the moment. Okay. The assessment first provides a critical first step to verify the claim that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. To test our due diligence. So, of course, we went back in time, and we show that this is not correct. In fact, the prompt's claim is not right. Um, and we verify that the actual split-adjusted trading range for GameSt- GameStop stock in August 2020 was from a low of four, sorry, $1.04 to a high of $1.67. So, over a dollar more than the prompt's claim. So, um, and to be clear, we're getting it from here and this timeline. There we go. Okay. So, for analysis to be valid, we must proceed using the uh corrected factual data. So, we will be using the real numbers instead of the one given in the prompt. So, there's some other key facts that we have to uh discover and define here. And uh the event in question, it was driven by a social media uh Reddit post on uh r/wallstreetbets um where that caused a price surge. And uh some key data here. So, the shorted interest peaked at 140% of the float. Analysis fundamental value was estimated at $10 to $40 and the price surged to a high of 483 in January of 2021. And I remember that. The uh key players were retail traders, uh Ryan Cohen, and hedge fund hedge funds like Melvin Capital. Melvin. Yeah.

So, my analysis will be um designed to test all three forms of the market efficient market hypothesis. So, there's the weak form, where uh past price patterns, um like technical analysis, able to predict future prices? So, we're going to answer that question. Uh, semi-strong form, so did the price rationally reflect all public information like short interest data, Reddit posts, and uh analyst reports? And the strong form: Did any entry uh with private information profit? So, this is now that the discovery phase is complete that I went through the uh problem, the uh situation that we're tasked with, the uh we debunked the prompt's claim, and we verified that fact. We went through the event, the key data, and the key players. We also went through and defined efficient market hypothesis, its three forms, and how we're going to be breaking that down. So, now that we have fully discovered um and uh defined everything here, we're going to move on to the represent stage. Goodness, excuse me, I'm sorry. My uh throat is very dry. It's just the room is just anyway, the uh second stage is um Represent, where I'm going to plan the analytical approach. Type up. Uh this is the blueprint for my uh analysis here. So, the goal here is to visually and analytically compare the observed uh stock behavior, GameStock, the GameStop stock behavior to the uh predictions of the uh gosh, uh the efficient market hypothesis. Um, so we're going to use the YFinance library in Python to go through this. This is the ticker symbol, of course. And then Ticker 2. This is going to be uh our market benchmark, which is going to be the S&P 500. And the time frame. So, that verification from discover phase, and improve the data discrepancy. Then we're going to move on to the price and volume visualization. So, we're going to create a two-panel chart, the stock price, trading volume. The uh violation test in the weak, semi, and strong form. So, we're going to um, excuse me. We're going to um move on to analysis number four, which is the behavioral and profitability assessment, so the qualitative. So, we're going to use the uh data to discuss behavioral biases and uh limit trading restrictions, right? So, now that we've gone through how we're going to uh go through this, implement with this code. So, just going to quickly walk through here. Here's a bit of code, but uh anyway, we import like stated, YFinance, Pandas, And uh we define, remember our ticker symbols from before, the represent stage. We have that here. Okay, we have our time frame. All right. So, I ran and, this is a little sneak peek ahead. So, we first imported everything, okay? This is showing everything here. The um this is what I just went through on the doc. The data verification here. Find the lowest price, right? Okay. And so we come across this chart. This is our time frame, the adjusted uh close price, and the uh history of the stock price.

So, to validate this, okay. So, sorry for that. The uh fourth stage here, we're going to validate. So, um, secondly, we're going to, oh my gosh. Falling apart today, I'm sorry. Did not get through this very smoothly. Secondly, let's go through the uh uh logically explain the output here. So, after walking through the code, running it through Colab, going through the chart, we're going to go through the output. We're going to see the uh low, stable price in 2020, the surge, and the correlations with the parabolic spike over uh $400. Um this visual output validates, that chart that we just witnessed, just saw, our uh uh analytical plan. The chart provides that clear uh visual evidence of market behavior dramatically deviating from a random walk. Excuse me. The price is not efficiently uh processing information. It's being driven by volume-fueled frenzy. And, you know, like that that uh more of that Reddit side than based on the numbers. And uh this output confirms our implement step, which was successful, and gives us the evidence that we need for our final analysis. So, all right. So, now, just to quickly recap, because I've been stumbling through, apologies. Um, we uh went through, we debunked the claim, we verified the claim, uh the fact that uh it was over a dollar more at its low and a high of 1 uh 67. Um, the event, I already described, won't go through that. We represented this um through uh what we were going to break down, implemented it through the code. All right. And then I walked through using, including the chart, we I walked through the uh code here. And um to evolve. So, this is like, does this make sense overall? So, yes, the output perfectly matches here because it follows with the story and the narrative of the event. Um and is there any better way? So, the disconnect between the stable 2020 price and the uh 2021 spike is automatically where we uh have to investigate because that's when this happened here in early part of the year. And two, is there a better way? Yes, the analysis is a high-level visual test. So, a more advanced like evolved analysis would do, would include like a uh running a uh weak form test, a quantitative version. So, we could run statistical tests for uh autocorrelation to uh quantify that GME's past returns were, in fact, predicting future returns. And uh with that spike, that's clearly not the case, but we would do that to display it. We would uh scrape the uh Wall Street uh bets posts information and uh formal event study, uh while difficult, we could still try, you know, to um plot the abnormal returns. However, in this extreme case, the volatility is so high that the model wouldn't really work. Um, so those are some theoretical um, you know, things that we could do to evolve this. Uh so it does, so yes, it makes sense. There is better ways, some better ways, some ways that are better than others. And uh we have uh some theoretical implications here. So, we have active versus passive. So, uh it shows that while markets are generally efficient, they're not always efficient. It highlights a rare, but, you know, significant failure here. Uh but it does not prove that uh active management is uh any better, better in, per se. Uh it proves that uh black swan events driven by mass coordination can occur. Um but the policy here is that, you know, the event evolved the market itself, leading directly to uh congressional hearings on the uh, you know, gamification of trading and the role of like payment for order flow. So, this confirms our analysis is sound and uh, you know, actually leads to deeper insight. Wow. It's really scratchy, I'm really sorry. Ah.

So, onto the reflex stage. So, on market efficiency, the uh Game GameStock market event was a clear, large-scale violation of two forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The weak form violation. The event was driven by momentum and herding effect, amplified by social media. So, this is a pattern in price and volume data that directly contradicts the random walk theory. Semi-strong form violation was the second one, where the market price peaking at $483 became completely detached from all of the publicly available fundamental information and analyst estimates of $10 to $40, which is nowhere close to what the market price peaked at. Uh so, based on the company's actual performance. So, highly overvalued, highly overpriced. Uh this proves the market was not rationally uh processing the public information. Uh on behavioral finance versus uh, you know, uh EMH uh basis here, we got the um two biases: Uh we saw clear evidence of herding. So, this is mass buying uh coordinated on Reddit, and uh overconfidence uh retail investors believing that they could beat hedge funds, and uh loss aversion, uh short sellers holding losing positions and creating the squeeze. So, uh limits to arbitrage. The EMH assumes rational investors can correct mispricing. But here, arbitrage was limited because when brokers like Robinhood restricted buying, they uh prevented the market from functioning, allowing the uh anomaly to continue. Um on profitability, looking back, it's easy to say uh buying uh GameStop was profitable. But uh looking forward, it it it was not a systematic or rational opportunity. It was a high-risk gamble on a non-repeatable event. Like a black swan event, like I stated before, the rational investor would not have systematically predicted or could have exploited this, seen this as a pattern, as it uh required guessing the peak of of a social movement. So, for the final little reflection here, following the DRIVER framework um allowed me to systematically fumble through, sorry, uh the uh and conduct this investigation where I began uh discovering the problem and correcting the data, first off. And then representing a clear analytical plan, implementing that plan into code, and validated that uh using the chart. I uh evolved the findings to consider deeper implications, and the reflection is that the uh stock event does not kill the EMH, but it places a strong boundary on it. It demonstrates that in the modern era, uh social media can act as a coordination mechanism to amplify social biases, creating if profound, but temp if temporary, market inefficiencies that financial theories must now account for. All right, I hope that ended up being a little more clarifying. And thank you for watching. Hope you enjoyed. Let's...",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Alexander Emenhiser and this is my video for the session 8 uh assignment. I'm in the 12:30 section of management 310 and it is currently Monday, November 10th. In this assignment, we are learning about market efficiency by looking at a specific case study from GameStop during their short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. We want to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to the efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks uh which is kind of the basic overview right here. In this assignment, we are going to verify all stated historical price data and document corrections. Uh test which form of market efficiency, which is either weak, uh semi semi- strong or strong, was violated. Uh we're going to evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. And we're going to compare the efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behaviors. We're going to assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies and these are all right here in the required analysis. Uh like before uh I'm will use all of answer all of these using the driver framework of learning and I'm going to continue to use the assistance of AI to help me uh build the models while validating with my own calculations. But before we begin, there's a statement that we need to verify in this assignment. uh and that is that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 right here. And I checked the historical price uh data for GameStop in August 2020 using Yahoo Finance as we see right here. And the closing price at the very end of August on August 31st was $167. As you see here's the close price and we can see here that the close prices is pretty much across the board all over a dollar. So that statement is incorrect. And the best way as we see here that we'd be able to communicate that is likely by going face to face is that is often uh the most persuasive way and the most direct way to uh tell someone. So now that we've cleared up uh this critical first step here uh it's time to use the driver framework to begin our analysis. So as we know here the first part of the driver analysis is to define and discover and that is a crucial step especially in this assignment as we see here. So in this stage I'm defining the market efficiency question and setting up the foundation for my research design. The goal of this project is to test whether the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 represented a violation of the efficient market hypothesis or whether the extreme price movements can still be explained within an efficient market framework. Specifically, I want to determine which form of efficiency was most challenged during the event. To clarify, the efficient market hypothesis can take three forms. These include the weak form where where prices reflect all past trading data, the semi- strong form where all publicly available information is absorbed, and the strong form where even insider information is fully reflected in prices. To start, I verified the accuracy of one of the key claims provided in the prompt, which is that GameStop traded at 4 cents a share in August 2020. And after checking historical data, I confirmed that the statement was incorrect. This verification step is crucial for ensuring that the rest of my analysis is based on valid data. So now that the data is verified, I can summarize the timeline that frames my efficiency investigation. And we can see some of this right here. So in August 2020, GameStop was trading at low levels and was viewed as near bankruptcy by many investors. In September of 2020, Ryan Cohen, the founder of Tui, acquired a 13% ownership stake, introducing new information to the market. In January 2021, the Reddit driven short squeeze occurred within prices spiking as high as $483 a share. In February 2021, congressional hearings were held to examine possible market manipulation and trading restrictions such as those implemented by Robin Hood. And in the present, the stock is stabilized to more typical levels relative to its fundamentals. In addition to this data, in addition to this timeline, I'm noticing the key data points that form the foundation of our analysis, which are again down here. Short interest peaked at 140% of the available float. Retail trading volume volume increased roughly 10fold during the squeeze. Hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 53% loss requiring external support. Analys analysts at the time valued the company between 10 and $40 per share far below the observed market prices. With this background, the central question becomes, did the market fail to incorporate new information efficiently or was this a rational though extreme reaction to risk, liquidity constraints, and collective behavior. To use this, I will use the efficient market hypothesis as my theoretical lens. The weak form will test whether past price and volume patterns could have predicted future movements. The semi- strong form will evaluate how quickly public news like Ryan Con's investment or the Reddit activity was reflected in prices. And the strong form will consider whether any group of investors appeared to have insider level information, persistent or persistentformational advantages. The research design for this analysis will still follow the driver framework, ensuring a structured and transparent process. In the define and discover stage, I am identifying a question and validating my data. So the next step here is to present and in this stage I'm translating my research question which is whether GameStop's market behavior violated the efficient market hypothesis into a structured analytical framework that I'll test using the event study code. My event focus my event study focuses on the five major points in GameStop's timeline. As we discussed right here, each state acts as a market efficiency test specifically targeting the semi-rong form of the efficient market hypothesis which says that prices should reflect all public information almost immediately. Using the Python code, I imported GameStop's historical data uh here uh through Yahoo Finance, then used the S&P 500 as a market bench bench and the code calculates daily returns, expected returns from a simplified CM and the abnormal returns. These are then aggregated into a cumulative abnormal return uh for event windows around each major announcement. The plotted charts that I'm going to show later uh in the code visualize GameStop's price trading volume and uh cumulative abnormal returns with vertical lines marking each key event. For example, if we observe a price drift or delayed adjustment after Conan's announcement or the congressional hearing that suggests a semi- strong form violation, meaning that the market did not immediately and rationally absorb new information. The code also helps visualize behavior anal anomalies, sharp spikes in trading volume around Reddics activity, overreaction patterns, and volatility clustering that aren't consistent with rational price discovery. These datadriven visuals make the analysis easier to interpret and connect directly to the behavioral finance explanations like hurting, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage. In summary, this stage represents my analytical blueprint using the event study code to empirically test the efficient market hypothesis predictions against GameStop's real world behavior supported by clear data visualization and behavioral context. We can see some of this that we described here. And we have the driver framework that we'll continue to use that kind of summarizes the code here. So now that we've given a little bit of background on the thought process behind creating uh this code, the next step is the imple implementation stage. And in this section, I'll demonstrate the systematic implementation of the event study methodology using our Python code. The goal is to quantitatively test whether GameStop's price movement around 2020 to 2021 events were consistent with market efficiency. or reflected behavioral irregularities. The process begins by loading all relevant Python libraries. Pandas and num numpy for data handling, Yahoo Finance for historical stock and market data, stats models for regression analysis, CYP for hypothesis testing, and Mattplot lib for visualization, which are all kind of in this area here. Then I define two key time windows. The estimate estimation window and which runs from August to December 2020. A calm pre-event period using used to estimate GameStop's normal relationship with the overall market. And then I use the event window which covers January 13th through January 29th uh at the height of the short squeeze. By separating these two periods, we can measure what returns would have been expected under normal conditions and then identify how far reality deviated during the event, which is kind of all of this right here. Using the estimation window, I fit a market model, essentially a regression, where GameStop's daily return is predicted from the market's return. The estimated coefficients alpha and beta describe GameStop's typical performance pattern before the event. This fitted model gives the expected return each day, allowing us to compute abnormal returns, the difference between actual and expected performance during the event period. Those abnormal returns are then summarized into the cumulative abnormal return, which measures the total deviation from market expectations over the squeeze window. If the cumulative abnormal returns is significantly positive, it suggests that the stock outperformed what standard models would predict, potentially indicating a violation of semi-strong market efficiency. To confirm whether the cumulative abnormal returns are uh are meaningful, I run statistical tests. A t test checks whether the average abnormal return differs significantly from zero. And a bootstrap test resamples those returns thousands of times to ensure robustness even if returns are not normally distributed. Low P values from these tests would show that event returns were statistically abnormal, not just random noise. The next part examines behavioral evidence. Now, our Python code here compares average trading volumes before and after the event, showcasing how retail uh activity exploded well beyond historical norms. It calculates uh the an AR1 coefficient essentially measuring whether returns were predictable from one day to the next. A higher AR1 values during the event suggest short-term momentum and hurting behaviors inconsistent with weak form market efficiency. I also check skewess and curtosis which quantify the asymmetry and fat tails in return highlighting the presence of extreme one-sided market movements.

To test whether rational investors could have exploited these anomalies, I run simple trading simulation. The code applies a naive movement rule, buying after a positive abnormal return and selling after a negative one while factoring in realistic trading cost and short scale restrictions. This shows whether the anomalies were actually exploitable once transaction frictions were considered. If profits disappear once costs and constraints are added, that supports the arguments that markets may appear inefficient but still aren't systematically beatable by rational investors. Finally, the model produces a structured decision output summarizing the form summarizing which form of the efficient market hypothesis appears violated. Persistent return autocorrection indicates weak form inefficiency. Significant cumulative abnormal returns point to semi- strong form violations and strong form efficiency is assumed untestable with public data. The printed results summarize these findings alongside alpha beta cumulative abnormal returns p volume multipliers and trading outcomes. Our Python code here concludes with several visual v visualizations that make these results easier to interpret. Our first chart chart plot scheme stops price over time

with uh several visualizations that make these results easier to interpret. uh the window shaded uh visually capturing the short squeeze spike. The second plot here shows the cumulative abnormal return curve highlighting how price deviations build up across the event period. And our third uh graph here compares average trading volumes before and during the event as well as the assignments stated retail volume multiplier. Together, these visuals make the analysis more digestible and directly connect the data behavior to the concepts of market efficiency and investor rationality. Overall, this implementation executes the event study methodology end to end from data gathering and regression modeling to abnormal return analysis, statistical testing, behavioral indicators and visualization. This systematic approach ensures that every step in the analysis is transparent, reproducible, and linked directly to the economic interpretation of the efficient market hypothesis. So now that we've implemented our code, and I've even further explained it, uh the next step is validation where we test whether our findings are statistically and economically meaningful rather than just random noise. So from our output we can see that the cumulative abnormal return uh during the event window was 3.99 or that roughly equates to 399% with a t value of 043.

Uh this means that under traditional significant testing, these abnormal returns were statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5% level. Evidence that something unusual was happening in GameStop's price behavior. Uh

the first chart plots as we've described uh plots their price over time. The second is the abnormal returns and the third compares the average trading volumes. Uh however when we apply a bootstrap test which resamples the data thousands of times uh without assuming normality the p value rises to 96 as we see here suggesting that once we account for the heavy tails on volatility clustering the statistical case for inefficiency becomes weaker. This tells us an important story. While price surge look while price surge looks extreme, it is difficult to statistically separated from the kind of rare events that occasionally occur in the market. To strengthen our validation, we also check economic significance, which is whether a rational investor could have earned systematic

uh profits after considering risk and transaction costs costs and constraints. The back test results show that profitability depended heavily on the borrow limit. When shortening wasn't possible, returns were large, but under realistic constraints with borrowing costs and transaction fees, profits quickly dropped toward ordinary levels. That reinforces the idea that even though prices were inefficient temporarily, it is it wasn't easy for rational traders to exploit that inefficiency in real time.

Finally, robustness checks confirm that the volume surged by roughly 9.2 compared to normal levels

uh are consistent with behavioral activity. But over our efficiency market hypothesis test results show no clear violation of weak or semi- strong form efficiency. once transaction and liquidity frictions are considered. So in the validation stage, the takeaway is that while GameStop's event window produced massive abnormal returns, the results are fragile under bootstrapping, constrained by real world trading limits and are only marginally significant statistically. So the next stage is to evolve. And in this stage, I take what I've learned from GameStop's event and apply those insights into real world investment strategy and market policy considerations. The evolve stage is about in turning empirical findings into actionable knowledge, bridging theory with practice. From our result results, we observe that GameStop's cumulative abnormal return during the event window was nearly 400% as we can see here with significant short-term deviations from the market model. However, these extreme returns occurred only just a few trading days under conditions of exceptional volatility and market frictions. The key insight here is that even when markets appear inefficient, uh in the short term, systematic and riskadjusted profits are often impossible to capture Exxante due to limits to arbitrage, high transaction costs, and borrowing constraints. The back testing portion of our analysis reinforces this. When we simulate rational trading strategies across varying uh excuse me, when we simulate rational trading strategies across varying transaction costs and borrowing limits, the total return and sharp ratios decline sharply once realistic frictions are introduced. For example, under normal liquidity conditions and modest transaction costs, profitability dropped from over 400% in frictionless case to less than 30% when realistic limits were applied. This demonstrates that while inefficiencies may exist in theory, practical constraints are often revert are often prevent arbitraries from eliminating or exploiting them fully. for investment strategy. This implies that passive management remains the optimal approach for most investors even in the presence of occasional abnormalities. The efficient market hypothesis especially in its semi-rong form remains a powerful guiding framework because it predict correctly predicts that consistent outperformance is difficult once cost and risk are factored in. However, behavioral insights add an important layer that while prices are generally efficient, investor sent sentiment and coordination through social media can generate temporary dislocations that active managers may monitor, not to exploit directly, but to manage risk exposure exposure during volatility spikes. On the policy side, these findings emphasize the importance of the market infrastructure and transparency. The GameStop episode revealed how broker imposed trading restrictions and margin requirements can amplify short-term inefficiencies. Strengthening liquidity management, transparency in short-term interest reporting, and communication between retail and institutional participants can help stabilize markets without suppressing the without suppressing legitimate retail participation. Ultimately, this stage shows that our understanding of market efficiency must evolve from a binary concept to a con continuum. Markets are not perfectly efficient or wholly irrational, they are adaptive systems where information, incentives, and human behaviors interact dynamically. The practical takeaway is that while inefficiencies can emerge, they are typically unpredictable, short-lived, and difficult to monetize systematically, reinforcing the enduring relevance of efficient market principles for long-term investors. In the final stage, which is reflection, we step back to synthesize what our analysis reveals about how markets truly behave, not just in theory, but in practice. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that prices fully and instantly reflect all available information in this weak form. In its weak form, prices should already incorporate past price movements. In its semi-rong form, all publicly available information should be embedded in prices and in the strong form, even insider information would be reflected, leaving no room for consistent excess returns. Our analysis of the GameStop short squeeze shows that while prices deviated dramatically from fundamental values, these deviations were not a straightforward violation of the efficiency market hypothesis. The cumulative abnormal returns were statistically large. They occurred under extreme conditions including concentrated short interest, unprecedented retail coord coordination and temporary trading restrictions. These represent structural and behavioral distortions rather than persistent inefficiencies. Often those factors subsided. Prices quickly realigned with fundamentals consistent with the idea that markets are self-correcting over time. Behavioral finance provides the missing context for understanding why the efficient efficiency market hypothesis appears to break down during events like this. hurting behavior, social amplification from platforms like Reddit, and overconfidence created positive feedback loops that drove prices far from equilibrium. Simultaneously, limits to arbitrage, including high borrow cost, margin pressure, and platform imposed restrictions prevented rational investors from correcting the mispricing. These mechanisms explain how temporary inefficiencies can emerge even in an otherwise efficient market framework. When we bring both when we bring both perspectives together, the conclusion is that the efficiency market hypothesis is not wrong, but that it's incomplete without behavioral and structural considerations. The efficiency market hypothesis captures the long run equilibrium forces that restore efficiency while behavioral finance explains the shortrun deviations driven by human psychology and institutional constraints. In reflecting on this project, the key lesson is that the real world markets operate in the intersection of efficiency and emotion. Information does not move rapidly, but human behavior determines how it is interpreted and acted upon. The GameStop event ultimately reinforces a nuanced understanding, which is that markets are broadly efficient but subject to short-lived inefficiencies when a collective sentiment, constraints, and incentives align in an unusual way. Overall, this case demonstrates that while markets can bend under collective emotion, they rarely break under reason, illustrating the dynamic coexistence of behavioral forces and the long run market efficiency.

",FALSE,1,"0:01 Alright, good evening everyone. Uh, for today's assignment, we have session 8. Which is the market efficiency and behavioral finance assignment.
0:13 Uh, as we go here, through here, we are at- asked to use an AI platform, I use Google Gemini again to discuss, go through the driver, using the driver method.
0:25 Umm, and discuss, uhh, market efficiencies and behavioral finances and come up with an umm, equation or a code through Python.
0:36 Umm, so here I have the first part which is data verification, umm, of the information given back in the book.
0:44 Whoa. So we have the D to find and discover, uhh, we have the research problems so we go through and we identify, you know, so as we have our EMH, so we determine if it's, you know, weak, semi-strong, or strong.
0:59 Uh, we go through and we talk about it. And then we have, uh, each requirement, we have the data source, and we have the purpose.
1:07 So then we move forward. In order to the R, which is the representing part, which is here. Mapping the analytical framework.
1:15 And for this, with the ehm- h testing, we have the period, the days, the purpose of analysis, and then the ehm-h testing.
1:24 best. We're given a couple of formulas here that we're able to use, umm, as part of the R. little bit more.
1:32 I'll and driver. Umm, as we continue down, umm, we have the I, which is the implementation of the market efficiency event study.
1:45 And here, we're able to see the EMH, um, kind of, . broken down into different periods, right? So, we have through Python, this is our coding that we're able to- use, umm, and that way it gives us a, umm.
2:04 So, we'll see you We have, we're, we're determined, stock return, right? So, we go through Python, we enter that in.
2:12 Mm. Mm. And then it gives us, uhm, an output, and then we do the same thing for abnormal return. Have that go through.
2:21 Put it on, and then, uhm, what those mean is the eyes. So we interpret that for market efficiency. So, uhm, means, uhh, this is a largely unpredictable positive and normal returns during the period, uhh, the period of straw evidence, uhh, the shows of, violation of a semi-strong market efficiency for
2:39 the E-M-H implication. So that's the eye. And then to the V, to do. We're gonna go we have the validate.
2:46 So, umm, our findings, efficiency findings. We have the statistical significance. That's signal. So, we tested that, you know, we tested e-m-h, uhh, I have a couple of different tests here that we go through and that we're able to see.
3:02 And then, finally, as we get down here to, uhh, kind of the market model, I guess you could say. Uhh, uhh, we have the test and adjustment, so, factor model, liquidity, liquidity, uhh, momentum factors in that microstructure risk.
3:17 Uh, the short squeeze risk, uhh, and then we have the purpose and GME implication for all through those. moves. And then, finally, um, the E and the R, so obviously, uh, evolve what that means for future UME market.
3:33 Thank you. Umm, and how that can apply and relate to each other. And then, they reflect on what it means and, ooh.
3:41 What this, why we, why we do what we do, uhm. And then, I just went in further and broke it down, uhm, what the evolve meant.
3:49 So, it actually, you know, you're able to look at more detail post-GME behavioral view, and then verses like a pre-GME ehm- h view.
3:59 Uhm, and then finally, as you go down through that, you see cost of equity, stability for WACC. You see. And then, uh, we get to the evolve and the final couple stages here.
4:11 Um. And. me. And basically, it just answers the final question and goes through a general analysis of it. So. But this was this week's assignment.
4:21 For, um, market efficiency and behavioral finance. Um, thank you so much for watching. That is going through. Using the driver method and using code through Python.

",FALSE,1,"0:00 Alright, welcome back guys.
0:01 So in this video we're going to talk through another real world case study in, uh, financial theory. So kind of the, the GameStop, uh, short story.
0:12 Squeeze situation. So kind of going through a Python script here first, as we usually do, and then investigating the future.
0:20 Facts of the event and analyze this kind of market anomaly, uhm, and what it really tells us about the efficient market hypothesis.
0:28 So, we will be going through the code here first as always, and we are importing our different, uhm, different functions here to kind of serve as our attention, er, not attention.
0:44 Uhm, information getters, and section two will then be, uhm, kind of the date of retrieval, as it usually is, kind of downloading, at least this time, which will be new, the GME file.
1:00 ticker, so the GME ticker kind of sets the, after setting the date range for from January 2020 to March 2021, kind of captures the entire event that we're kind of analyzing here.
1:15 And second, section three is kind of the core of our define and discover and validate phase. So we're going to kind of look at the downloaded data to find the lowest price in august 2021 and the highest price in january of 2021.
1:34 Alright, I think it was august 2021, august 2020. Excuse me. So, and then step four will then just kind of be, uhm.
1:48 The, our analysis and kind of where we'll print these facts and kind of compare them to the assignments. Kind of the claims, so let's run the script and kind of analyze the output and this is kind of the most important part and just look at the numbers and see what it tells us.
2:07 So, first, we have, uhm, the script, which kind of reports two key facts from the actual historical data. So, the lowest GME in August 2020 was $1.07.
2:28 So that's split adjusted. And the GME closing price in January 2020 2021 was 80.
2:41 Let's see. Oh, it says 1.20.75. Sorry, I don't know why it said 1.07. It's 1. And then, Yes, okay, correct.
2:55 And, so, kinda, going back after we see the, ,dialogue... ,and then the $120.75, kinda, compare it back to our assignment.
3:06 So, the assignment, ,GME peaked at $483, and our code is kind of only showing, like, So, we're kind of gonna go back and, and see what's really going on, so, This is kind of our first conflicting signal, so, and it's, it's a technical one.
3:28 So, the 4 cent value is, incorrect, and we need to adjust it, uhm, which is kind of our verdict and analysis number 1.
3:39 So, The $483 value is correct, and it was the intraday spree, pre-intraday pre-split high. So the data from Y-Finance is split-adjusted, and GameStop is GameStop had a 4-for-1 split in 2022, and we're looking at closing prices.
4:02 The 86-88 split-adjusted close is equivalent to a pre-split close of, uh, $3.47, uhm, $3.52, which was high on, on January 27th.
4:18 Uh, the $4.83 was a monetary split. It was intraday spike the next day. So, the prompts $0.04 data is fundamentally wrong, but the $4.83 peak is correct.
4:37 the efficient market hypothesis versus reality. So, the semi-strong form or efficient EMH states that all publicly available information like fundamentals, analyst reports, etc.
4:53 and things of that nature should be reflected in the price. So, the rational price estimates about ten to forty dollars, yet the price hit four hundred eighty three.
5:05 So, the public knew GM was fundamentals were poor. And, but they also knew short interest was over one hundred forty.
5:17 And by GME I mean GameStop Kind of use this public information to trigger the squeeze.
5:29 Uhm, so the anomaly was the price wasn't based on fundamentals. But on market mechanics and behavioral factors like social media.
5:40 Uhm. So that kind of brings us, after this, to our final verdict of, like. the, the form, like, which form of market efficiency was violated here, and we're looking at which.
5:57 weak, semi-strong, and strong, and so weak form is clearly violated because this form says you can't predict. future prices from past trading data, so this GameStop event was predictable by looking at the public short interest data and rising social media volume.
6:19 And the semi-strong form was heavy. Heavily violated because this is the core issue of the price not reflecting the true demand.
6:29 Negative fundamental value, wildly overshot, excuse me, overshot proving that publicly available information was not rationally priced. And the strong form was not necessarily tested because this event wasn't about private insider information.
6:48 It was just a public spectacle. So how do we kind of explain this? So this is not really an EMH failure, but a behavioral finance textbook case, if that makes sense.
7:00 So kind of going back hurting, which an entire subreddit kind of moved as one, if that makes sense. And then there was definitely overconfidence as well with the retail investors believing that they could collect more effectively beat Wall Street.
7:20 And it kind of also limits to arbitrage because this is the key concept with Wall rational investors just short the stock at $4.83?
7:31 Because they couldn't. As is like, you know, the market can, you know, remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
7:43 So, shorting GameStop at $4.83 was a bet that you, that could, wipe you out before the price ever returned to its natural or rational $40 value.
7:58 So, kind of to recap, uhm, our analysis kind of showed that the GameStop event isn't real. It isn't an anomaly that disproves market efficiency, it's really a perfect example of how behavioral finance and logic limits to arbitrage can create temporary, violent, and kind of high-risk pockets of inefficiency
8:21 . The price did rise. information, just not the fundamental information. And this kind of shows that the market is not a, a, a, single rational mind, but a complex system of competing and sometimes irrational human actions.
8:38 So, thank you for joining again, and we will see you next time.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Today I'll be analyzing the 2020-2021 
GameStop short squeeze to test the 
Efficient Market Hypothesis, and I'll be 
utilizing the DRIVER framework 
to structure this analysis logically. 
My primary objectives are to 
verify historical price claims, 
calculate abnormal returns relative 
to the S&P 500, and determine 
if this event violated semi-strong 
form market efficiency.
So we start with the Define 
and Discover stage. 
Here I am establishing the boundaries 
of the analysis. First, I import the 
necessary libraries Yfinance 
for data and Pandas for 
manipulation, shown right here. 
I have set the analysis timeline 
from August 1st, 2020 
to February 28th, 2021. 
August 1st is when GameStop 
was near bankruptcy levels, and 
February 28th was after the
initial squeeze subsided. 
Crucially, I'm defining the 
specific claim given in the 
assignment prompt to be verified
that GameStop traded at 4 cents 
in August 2020. I've set a variable 
claim_price to 4 cents to test 
this programmatically. Finally, 
I defined the S&P 500 Trust
as our market benchmark 
to represent the rational market 
return for our efficiency comparison.
This leads us to the Represent stage. 
The goal here is to fetch raw data 
and structure it into a format suitable 
for an event study. I'm pulling the 
Adjusted Close data. This is critical 
because GameStop underwent a 
4-for-1 stock split in 2022. If we 
looked at the raw 2020 prices without 
split adjustments, our analysis 
would be factually incorrect. 
In the dataframe construction, 
I align the GameStop price, 
the market price, and the volume data. 
I then calculate the daily returns 
using the percentage change function. 
This transforms the raw prices into 
return data, which allows us to 
compare the volatile stock against 
the stable market benchmark.
That leads us to the I stage Implement. 
This is where we execute the core 
financial calculations. First, 
I isolated the August 2020 data 
to perform the verification logic on 
the 4-cent claim price. 
Next, I calculate the volatility 
using a 7-day rolling standard deviation. 
This quantifies the risk introduced 
during the squeeze. Most importantly, 
I calculated the Abnormal Return. 
In financial theory, the Abnormal Return 
is the difference between the asset's 
return and the market return. 
If the market is efficient, 
the numbers should hover near zero, 
meaning the information is 
instantly priced in. 
Large, sustained deviations here 
will serve as our evidence of inefficiency. 
I also implemented a volume moving 
average to detect the liquidity changes 
associated with the retail trading surge.
V the Validate stage. 
This is where we actually execute 
the code and get some graphs. 
First, looking at the console output 
right here, you can see the boolean 
check for the 4-cent claim returned False. 
The actual split-adjusted low in August 2020 
was approximately $1.14. This confirms 
the prompt statement was 
factually incorrect and likely 
referred to the pre-split figure without 
proper adjustment. Looking at our 
first chart here, we observe the 
decoupling of price from fundamentals. 
The blue bars represent the 10-fold increase
in volume driven by retail investors 
on Reddit, and the price action follows 
a hyperbolic trajectory that cannot be 
explained by the weak-form 
efficiency of past prices.
On the second chart, the 
Daily Abnormal Returns, 
the purple line shows daily 
deviations from the market. We see 
massive spikes of volatility where 
returns exceed 50 to 100% in 
single days. This validates the 
market was not efficiently processing 
information, but rather reacting 
to liquidity flows and short 
squeeze mechanics.
In the Evolve stage, we advance 
this analysis to look at the 
Cumulative Abnormal Returns, or CAR. 
This green chart represents the 
aggregate wealth transfer during the event. 
In a strong or even semi-strong efficient 
market, this line would be relatively 
flat as price corrections 
would happen instantly. 
Instead, we see a sustained upward 
trend that persists for weeks. 
This serves as empirical evidence 
of limits to arbitrage.
Even though rational investors likely
 knew the stock was overvalued 
at $483, the risk of shorting prevented 
them from correcting the price. 
This confirms a breakdown in market 
efficiency due to behavioral factors.
Finally, the Reflect stage. 
This is where we summarize 
our findings to conclude the 
assignment. First, Data Verification
The assignment prompt's claim of a 
4-cent share price is proven false 
via historical data analysis. Two, 
Market Efficiency Status
This event illustrates a violation 
of semi-strong form efficiency. 
Publicly available information 
was used to generate abnormal profits, 
which shouldn't happen if prices 
perfectly reflect all public data. 
And Behavioral Factors
The data supports behavioral 
finance theories over the EMH. 
Herding behavior and social 
sentiment created a feedback 
loop that rational arbitrageurs 
could not immediately correct.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Aly and this is my analysis of the GameStop short squeeze using the driver framework. So, in order to do that, we want to determine whether or not markets are efficient by using the efficient market hypothesis or EMH to determine that stock prices should reflect all available information, meaning that no investor can consistently earn unusual returns. However, we have seen that the GME's price rose from about 1.67 to a high of 483 in January of 2021 and at start August 2020. So, this project tests whether or not these adjustments violated weak form, semi- strong or strong form market efficiency. So, the key questions are was the statement GME traded at 0.04 or 4 cents in August 2020 accurate? How did GME's price react to public information such as Ryan Cohen's stake? Did prices adjust quickly and rationally or did they overreact and could rational investors earn systematic profits? So, in order to do that, we use the data that was provided. So, the timeline is January January 2020 to February 2021. And in August 2020, we saw the near bankruptcy rumor. September 2020, Ryan Cohen buys 13% stake. January 2021, Cohen joins a GME board. And in January, the late January 2021, Reddit and WSB squeeze and trading restrictions. So from there, the plan is to first verify the data accuracy. So confirm the August 2020 price range from 1.04 to 1.67 67 and then document the correction to that claim. Then second we are going to collect data. Um so pull the GME and S&P returns and then mark dates. So identify the critical events meaning co and stake board news and restrictions. And then from there we're going to compute abnormal returns. So AR is the actual minus expected return. And then also analyze patterns. So we're going to check whether or not AR and CAR CR are different from zero. Then finally we will interpret and validate by comparing observed behavior versus EMH predictions and visualized findings. So generating graphs and charts for visualization. So from there,

I put all of that into Gemini and then into Collab and got this output. So the first step was to fact check a common claim, which was GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. So using that data, I verified that the actual adjusted price range was 1.0. 4 to 1.67 which was split adjusted and closing at 1.67 on August 31st.

So that statement was off by it says about 40 times meaning that the GameStop stock was extremely low but not near zero. So I documented this correction I feel pretty clearly so that all of the later analysis had accurate data. And for the communication approach it says professor I verified the stated claim that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020

sorry in August 2020 against historical data. So the actual closing price was $167 on August 31st with a monthly range of $14 to $167. So I have documented this correction and adjusted my analysis accordingly while maintaining the core research question. So from there I built my timeline um that in August 2020 prices near bankruptcy levels. September Ryan Cohen stake disclosure. January of 2021 is Reddit driven search to $483 here. And then in February, the trading restrictions and congressional hearings. And then from there, I have the um

the represent. So

to represent this problem, I used an event study approach. which was grounded by the CAPM model. So it uses a 200 day estimation window and this window covers about 5 days before and after the event. So here it shows oh 250 trading day estimation window and then it shows that the event window is 60 days between December 2020 and February 2021. And then the benchmark was the market index the S&P 500. So I tested the different forms being weak form, semi- strong and strong form. So weak form asks like can past prices predict future returns. Semi-rong form asks do prices instantly reflect the public information? in strong form usually asks can insiders or the investors that know um profit systematically and then for implement um I ran the automated event study pipeline. So for each event like Ryan Cohen's filing it calculates the AR and cumulative AR. So the C r or car and as we can see here um where is it

here it is the car jumps dramatically right after that initial surge and around the restriction date, which already demonstrates that prices don't fully reflect the public information right away. So, going back up.

I also ran a 

t test. So, T+1 buy and hold back test. So even though some of these windows looked profitable, it shows that once you account for the different cost and volatility that it may not necessarily be reliable for profits. And then

now I have to find my validation.

Okay. So to validate the these results I ran both um parametric and nonparametric tests and then

so these show that the price data correction is $167 not just the 4 cents And all statistical tests are significant. So the P is less than 0.05. So there will be no systematic profit for rational investors. And this limits to arbitrage prevented market correction. And then the theoretical implications are markets are eventually efficient not always efficient and behavioral factors dominate during extreme events. And then for integration between the finance and technology um automated event study methodology systematic hypothesis testing so the five tests that were down here.

So this shows the trading volume. So the different trading volumes between the start and end dates. and then the cumulative abnormal returns that we looked at. This is the price versus fundamental value and then the daily abnormal return. So this shows that the mean is 2.86%.

I don't know why it just zoomed in.

So for reflect I saw tha the weak form EMH was violated because prices showed strong um autocorrelation and it was very predictable. So there was a P of 0.7071.

The semi- strong was also violated because public short interest and co-en stake weren't completely reflected um which showed an AR of 2.86% and a p value of less than 0.001 which is obviously very close to zero. And then finally the strong form was also violated because um even the hedge funds that we saw lost about I think it said 53% and needed what they called a bailout. So overall um

the note for the professor was that historical price corrected from 0.04 so 4 cents to the $167 and all other data points were verified against sources. So this means that the GameStop event showed that markets are not always efficient especially under conditions of social distress or coordination and even behavioral biases. Um however markets do remain eventually efficient like this said and as we saw prices stabilized back to near fundamental values. So here it went way up and then started to stabilize. And then my biggest takeaway is that behavioral finance um and limits to arbitrage don't contradict the EMH, but instead they serve as an explanation for the short-term um kind of like distress or movements in the markets while also showing us that prices tend to settle back toward rational um levels over time. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"This is my response for the homework gate assignment and let us start off with the define and discover stage. So my goal for this assignment is to evaluate the market efficiency based on the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 2021. So let us look at the key information that is provided to us. Um and if we look at the textbook, we have told that this is the assignment overview and we are trying to investigate the market effic efficiency using this case study of GameStop or GME as a ticker um to evaluate the market efficiency as I said and here are some of the important information that are given to us. We have the event timeline. So what exactly happened in this case study? So, we have GME nearing bankruptcy levels, there being a significant uh stake that's been bought by Ryan Cohen. We have the Reddit um Wall Street bets driven price search to $483. And we have congestional hearings on market manipulation and then postevent price stabilization. Here are the key data points. So we have um some data points that will be used within the uh analysis as we go through it. Here is the required analysis and there are five different aspects that we are required to analyze and I'll be going through them within the represent eval implement and evolve stage. So let us first start off by looking at the represent stage. And what I wanted to do in the represent stage is basically have a summary or foundation of the information that we have uh to help set up the implement and evolve stage just to have a great basis to work upon while also looking to validate some of the information that is provided to us especially the the statement. So the GameStop traded at 0.04 in August of 2020. So here is the represent stage code and it's if I just run the code it is going to give us

um y there we go it give us a quick summary of the information provided to us. So we have the timeline we have the key data points but we also have the validification or verification of the that statement that we I just showed. So the game start stock price in Novea 2020. So Python has actually looked back into Yahoo Finance. So here's the Yahoo Finance um um aspect of the Python code and it's going to check the price at the given um date. So after checking that price, we see that the claim is invalid. The verification status is invalid and the actual cost was actually $1.04 on 2020 August uh 3rd of August 2020. And then yep, here we go. We have a quick summary. The statement is highly inaccurate. The actual price in the first trading day August 2020 was $1.04 and is roughly 26 times higher than the stated not. 04. So we now we have a a base to work upon as we have a clear understanding of the information provided to us and we've even taken the step to validate some of the information that was provided to us to get the best out of the analysis that we're going to start. So let us move to the implement stage. In the implement stage I will be focusing on essentially testing the efficiency of the market. Now the efficiency of the market is an aspect or concept that refers to the market being perfect and yeah the market it so what this essentially um the idea of the efficiency market hypothesis states that the market is always perfect and there are no unexpected changes that can occur in the market because um there's free information and everyone has access to the same information. So there's no chance for unexplained or yep unexplained price or abnormal returns or abnormal um changes or fluctuations in the stock prices and that's the and if we go to the textbook uh we can clearly see what the actual definition is. So stock prices fully reflect all the available information making it impossible to consistently achieve abnormal returns through analysis of publicly available data. And these are the three forms of market efficiency. So we have the weak form, the semi- strong form and the uh strong form. So what these three forms of market efficiency tell us is that there are different levels of what doesn't work in terms of in the weak form technical analysis doesn't work to give you a advantage in um you know prices or returns. So prices reflect all past prices and volume information. Whereas for semi- strong uh firm the prices reflect all publicly a available information. Therefore fundamental analysis doesn't work. And for strong firm prices reflect all the information including private information essentially stating that the insider trading doesn't work. Now let us move to the code again. So here the code is actually going to run all test all the three um market efficiency types and see which one is in violation which one the GME um case study violates. So first off to test the weak form EM violation we see how the condition is that um here's the clear calculation of it. So autocorrelation of return should be near zero and that is the condition that's required for a weak firm uh economic market hypothesis violation. So after the code runs the I we'll see it towards the end but this is the setup for the weak form violation. we have the semi- strong EMF violation and for the CA the condition for this is that the total uh C which is accumulated um abnormal return should be near zero and this is the way it's actually looking at the real-time data and the code is calculating the values. Now here are some of the equations. So the expected return equation is actually um the alpha plus the beta times the return of the market. And we know how the beta and alpha values are used to measure how the stock actually moves relative to the market. Now the abnormal return is actually calculated um these are two different equations for the abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return. So we have the expected return which is the alpha bliss beta times the event data. So get it from the real time Yahoo finance data itself. For equation two we have the abnormal return and this is the actual return of the market minus the expected return from the market.

And then we have the cumulative abnormal return. So which is the cumulative product of 1 plus the abnormal return minus one. Now and then we have lastly the strong from EMH violation where the condition is that the strong from EMH is violated if the insiders cannot earn abnormal returns. As we know this form of this type of market efficiency is based on having access to insider information. So if you run the code we see quite a lot of data but we we have clear u conclusions to be made from the uh analysis and calculations. So first off you know we the the Python code tells us the data download was complete but secondly we see that the weak from EMH violation was violated as there is a higher autocorrelation value which suggests that past prices could predict future movements during the squeeze. This is in violation of the weak form as we saw that the past prices reflect all prices all prices reflect all past prices and volume information. Therefore, technical analysis shouldn't work whereas here technical analysis would work could predict the future moments during the squeeze. Semi strong was massively violated as there is a large um accumulated uh abnormal return which shows public information and this goes back to the spread of information in Reddit and that's was not reflected efficiently and these um the uh the aspect of spreading information of Reddit can link back to behavioral financial challenges such as behavioral biases including anchoring. So over relying on the first piece of information received and hurting. So following a crowd behavior rather than independent analysis.

And now for strong em violation was well strong em form em was also in violation as public information caused a massive abnormal return and strong and then here is the analysis volume analysis and behavioral prep. So we see the volume factor the peak volume is actually 16.3 times larger or yeah 16.3 times the prevent average and this is the peak that we see and this is the accumulative abominal return for the GME company. You can see how there's a clear peak during that squeeze and then this balances out as said in the represent stage. So impos the we get the final statement implement stage is complete weak semi- strong and strong from EMH were all empirically or logically violated. Now to validate this um it goes back to the um implement code actually because the red line that we see is the concept of how the market should be in terms of the economic market hypothesis or efficient market hypothesis sorry as there should be no price fluctuations because perfect information is available to all users within the market. Now if we look at the actual data in uh Yahoo Finance, we see the same peak being resembled around the August of 2020 or between 2020 and 2021 and that is the similar to the cumulative abnormal returns. So it correlates well and shows that this is a valid assumption or valid finding from the data. Now let us move to the evolve stage. The evolve stage is more conceptual. It's not uh really um you know quantity or value based. So if you run the code as the evolve stage I primarily focused on the rational investor pro profitability analysis and the theoretical implications. So this code is just to you know write down a clear um analysis of what is actually going on at uh in this squeeze or GME uh case study. So evaluation of systematic profit opportunities. So we see that there will be for under EMH prediction so efficient market hypothesis there should be no systematic profit for a rational investor. However, in reality, we see a cumulative uh um cumulative abnormal return, sorry, of actually 303.89

and this was actually calculated right 3%. So, we see how the estimated alpha for the abnormal return was 0.0044 0044 and the estimated beta was 1.16 which is quite high. So we see how the total accumulated this is back referring back to the implement stage code. So we see there's a 313% um C value and that just shows how deferring or how deviated that the market is moving compared to the EMH philosophy or concept. Then we get to the X on tier and before the fact. So systematic profit was highly unlikely because there was a high risk and unpredictable duration before the fact that the actual you know peak actually happened which is not rational investing and we have the analysis of risk adjusted returns and limit to arbitrage our arbitrage. So the risk is that the high volatility estimated by the standard deviation of approximately 0.35 means that returns were not truly risk adjusted for the unique market microstructure risk and the limits to arbitrrage were that rational hedge funds could not profit by shorting due to the high stock borrowing costs and the marginal costs and the risk of infinite loss is a major limit. If he and if I want to provide a clear explanation of this, I have Gemini right over here. So what that is essentially telling us is that the exante before the event a rational investor could not plan for this as this is a completely unexpected um spread of information and the profit required extreme risk and as the duration was totally unpredictable. The limits to arbitrage essentially tells us how they f the people investing faced a risk of infinite loss if the price kept rising along with high borrowing costs. Now let us move on to the um assessment of information advantages. So we have the primary advantage was not insider data but the publicly available data and this connects back to the idea of anchoring and hurting and how there's information or manipulation of information in uh Reddit and other um social uh media or not social media but public um information pages. Then we come to the theoretical implications. So we have the EMH versus the behavioral finance framework comparison. So EMH failure we have the massive you know 313% um accumulated uh abnormal return and the price peak far above the analysis analyst fundamental value demonstrates the failure of the concept to explain price formation. Behavioral finance is actually successful here because concepts such as hurting driven by the 16.3% volume spike and the fear of missing out successfully explain the disconnect between the price and the actual value. And this connects back again to the learning and anchoring processes and other behavioral biases resulting in such peaks. Now let's move on to the active versus passive management implications. So under the active management the event proves that the cross in efficiencies exist but exploiting them requires extreme risk tolerance because you wouldn't know what exactly would happen in such a unpredictable period. So you need perfect timing and high risk tolerance.

Then we have passive management and this event reinforces the principle that while extreme anomalies occur, the associated extreme risk and unpredictability is not worth taking because they're unsuitable for the long-term rational systematic profit. Lastly, we have market efficiency policy implications. So for market uh microstructure regul regulators must address the liquidity clearing risks demonstrated by the training halls to ensure that the market can handle extreme volatility driven by the retail coordination for transparency. This calls for this calls for faster and more frequent reporting of short interests to provide the genuine public information reduce the market fluctuations and frictions which are exploited by coordinated buyers. This again goes on too uh more specifically the anchoring process or bias because once someone picks up on the information and tries to follow it, they will likely gain momentum because other people are seeing how the prices of the stock is fluctuating and how that's impacting the interest from other investors. So you need to have clear transparency in terms of information so that people don't fall for you know false signals and this comes along with the manipulation aspect of it as the case this case highlights the difficulty of policing policing decentralized on social media platforms under existing market manipulation laws. again referring back to the what exactly happened in Reddits and what caused this peak for GameStop Corporation in the first place. So to reflect, determining market um market efficiency is quite a complex process, but I thought it was a very clear um process to implement that helps us understand why prices are not uh prices do not align with the efficient market hypothesis. As we cannot control what others do and there's always going to be you know spread of misinformation and you know high risk tolerating people or low risk or yeah high risk tolerating people who will try to take the extra risk to get the most the highest profit margins that they can gain. And the idea of profit margin is completely ignored in the EMH policy because they believe that the um pro you know prices will not fluctuate when all perfect information is available. So for GameStop Corporation, we see that market efficiency was not met during that case or during that period for the case study. And that it was interesting to see how many different aspects such as you know behavior biases, uh market policy implications, passive management, um and risk adjusted returns. how much different things that can go into the market efficiency concept and how much all of them interlin to give us a better understanding of what is actually going on in the market and how we should understand it.

structure? Before I do anything else, I
0:33
started with factchecking. This
0:35
assignment stated that GameStop traded
0:37
at
0:39
4 cents in August of 2024, but that's
0:42
incorrect. According to Yahoo Finance,
0:45
GameStop actually closed around 1.67 67
0:49
$1.67 per share in August 2020 on a
0:53
split adjusted basis or around $4 to $6
0:57
unadjusted. Yes. So yes, it was trading
1:00
at low levels but nowhere near 4.
1:03
This stage helped me define the real
1:06
data, confirm the timeline, and
1:09
understand the core events like Ryan
1:11
Cohen's investment. the January 21 2021
1:15
price surge
1:17
to 483 in the trading restrictions that
1:20
followed.
1:22
Next, I mapped out my analytical plan.
1:25
And then this is the represent stage. I
1:28
decided to test how gain, stop, price
1:30
movements fit into three forms of the
1:32
efficient market hypothesis. The weak
1:34
form which says prices reflect all past
1:37
data. The semi-rong form which says
1:40
prices reflect all public information.
1:42
in the strong form, which would mean
1:44
even insider information is reflected,
1:47
though that's almost never realistic. I
1:50
also plan to explore behavioral finance
1:52
explanations like hurting,
1:54
overconfidence, attention bias, and
1:56
FOMO, as well as limits to arbitrage
1:59
since short selling constraints in
2:01
margin requirements played a major role
2:03
in this case.
2:05
To test efficiency, I chose an event
2:07
study approach, comparing GameStop's
2:09
actual returns to what the CAPM model
2:12
would predict around key events.
2:16
Now, let's move to the implement stage
2:18
where I actually put the analysis into
2:20
action. I use Python and Google Collab
2:23
and pulled data from Yahoo Finance for
2:25
both GameStop, GME, and S&P 500. Then I
2:30
ran a CAPM based event study. That means
2:33
I estimated GME's alpha and beta using a
2:35
250day estimation window and then
2:38
calculated abnormal returns and
2:40
cumulative abnormal returns around
2:43
important dates like August 2020 13D
2:46
filing and the December 2020 increase in
2:48
Cohen stake in the January 2021 trading
2:52
hall.
2:53
And so as you can see here is on the
2:57
screen I have my code listed out here.
3:00
You can see I have everything in here
3:02
and this was AI generated. So I'm not
3:03
going to go through and fully elaborate
3:05
everything on there, but my results that
3:08
I'm able to get from this collab um and
3:12
Python, you can see we have some visual
3:14
representations here. Here's a first
3:17
graph and this is the GME C around that
3:22
first state there 21208.
3:25
And so you can just see those visual
3:26
representations of those important
3:29
timelines that were stated in the
3:33
earlier.
3:34
So the graph shows how abnormal spikes
3:38
return spikes massively in the mid
3:39
January 2021 especially when retail
3:41
volume increased 10fold in trading
3:44
platforms like Robin Hood began limiting
3:46
purchases. So you can see those spikes
3:49
um around that time.
3:52
In the validate stage, I tested whether
3:54
those abnormal returns were
3:55
statistically significant, and they
3:58
definitely were, particularly during the
4:00
2021 January surge. But that doesn't
4:03
necessarily mean investors could
4:05
systematically profit. During the peak,
4:08
we saw buying restrictions, margin
4:10
calls, and haltered halted trading,
4:12
which made it almost impossible for
4:14
rational traders to capture those gains
4:16
in real time. So while GameStop's price
4:20
clearly overreacted, the presence of
4:22
these frictions actually supports part
4:23
of the EMH because if inefficiencies
4:27
couldn't be easily exploited.
4:30
The next stage is evolve. And this is
4:32
what I learned and how I'd apply going
4:35
forward.
4:37
This event shows that while markets
4:38
aren't perfectly efficient, short-term
4:40
distortions can still be explained by
4:42
behavioral forces and real world
4:44
constraints. Social media coordination,
4:47
emotional investing, and limits to
4:49
arbitrage cause temporary mispricing.
4:51
But over time, prices move back to back
4:54
towards fundamental values. It
4:56
highlights how behavioral finance
4:58
completes the EMH, showing that human
5:01
psychology can dominate for a while, but
5:03
not forever.
5:05
Finally, in the reflect stage, I looked
5:08
back at what all this means. GameStop
5:10
short squeeze challenged the semi- long
5:13
the semi- strong form of market
5:14
efficiency. Prices didn't immediately
5:16
reflect information and they reacted
5:19
irrationally for a period. However, when
5:22
we factor in things like risk,
5:23
transaction costs, and trading
5:25
restrictions, the efficient market
5:27
hypothesis still holds up reasonably
5:29
well. To me, this case proved that
5:32
markets can be both efficient and
5:34
emotional. efficient in the long run but
5:36
tempor temp temporarily driven by crowd
5:38
behavior and attention. It also shows
5:41
why passive investing remains powerful
5:43
and why trying to time hype driven
5:47
trades is incredibly risky. Thanks for
5:50
watching my driver analysis of the
5:52
GameStop short squeeze. This project
5:54
helped me connect financial theory,
5:56
behavioral economics, and data analysis
5:58
all through one of the wildest markets
6:00
ever wildest market events in recent
6:02
history.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Ivy and today we're gonna talk about the GST stop quiz. So to start with I want to start with a little story, a background. So, in early 2021, oh, sorry, in early 2021, a bunch of regular investors on Reddit noticed that hedge funds had a heavily bat against GameStop stock and they all started buying shares together, which made the price skyrocket and forced the hedge funds to buy more to cover losses. This caused a short squeeze and turning a struggling company into a huge stock frenzy. So I remember one of our class our professor make us watch a movies about this and it was quite interesting. I mean at that time G Gamestock is nearly bankrupt. It's not doing really well but after people just start to buy the stocks and all of that and all the people are talking about it the social media spreading like how they come back alive which is pretty cool. Okay so start with define and discover. The purpose of this analyze is to evaluate market efficiency using the game stock which is the GME short squiz of 2020 and 2021. This project examinates price behavior rel relative to the efficient market hypothesis. Verifies key factual claims measure abnormal returns and trading value and assess whether investors behavior can be explained through rational or behavioral frameworks. And critical thinking we need to verify is the statement of GANSTOP traded at 0.04 in August 2020. If this is wrong, the correct price data will be documented sorry documented along with the correction to the professor. So they will be at the end of the page. The scope and time frame. So the primary period is August 2020 to March 2021. the extended data through 2023 for context and postevent stabilization and key facts to verify. So it's actually we're going to have more than that but these are the like some of them. So August 2020 closing prices and Ryan colon RC venture stake disclosure peak short interest volume increase trading restriction days Melvin capital losses analysis and in strength stick fundamental value estimates. So those are some of them represent. So we got some research questions like was GME traded at 0.04 04 in August 20 accurate and if not what was the true price range which type of market efficiency is violated where systematic risk adjusted profit opportunities available to rational investors can observed on my all the miles be explained through the behavioral finance limit to Arabage and market micro structure or did they fundamentally contradict EMH and we have a couple method here like verify daily closing and adjusting prices for August 2020 to market March 2021. Plot time series data like price returns, volatility and volume. Calculate abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns using a market model. Evaluate your interest ratio and days to cover. Compare peak trading values to prevent average and then analyze behavior and micro structure factors are null. So the claims are going to be verified if two independent rate reputable sources agree and numeric numeric fold changes are considered accurate if within plus 20 and negative 20% of calculated values. So let's move to our implementation. So here we have our link um take us to things that I have AI to generate code do the coding for us and then we can find like the alpha here beta here and I also have the graph and when we move down say like interpretation summary so there's a summary that GME traded around 1.67 in August 20 is not 0.04 04 um it's not 0.04 it's around 1.67 67 and volume rose roughly 18.3x at a January 2021 peak consistent with short squid narives and C shows extreme abnormal returns during the event window indicating deviation from semi-strong market efficiency so here it's pretty clear we have everything we need some some of the summary let's move to validate so I have event timeline and key data points that we get on validate and with the sore. So, um because these are pretty long, I won't like I'll click in it and make sure the link is working, but I won't like try to find the statement that I called inside because that'll be too much. So, I just have the information here from the source. So, to start with, we got August 2020 with the GME near bankruptcy level. It's partially correct from the source we have in here. Um this article here um we are having the answer of GameStop was among retailers not in bankruptcy that announced closing many stores highlighting financial distress. So it was not doing good for sure but well it's not in bankruptcy. So it's partially correct it's near. And then the second one August 2020 Ryen Cohen chewy fun acquires 13% stake which is wrong. So we have this government documentation here. um you know have the information in there and in here it says that RC Ventures managed by Ryan Colon acquires a 9% stake in GameStop. So it's nine it's not 13. Um here we have January 21 with the Reddit Wall Street Bats driven price surges to 500 oh 483 and that was correct. We used the Wikipedia for this references and we'll talk about that GameStop stock price peak in at an intra intraday high of approximately 483 in late January 21. So it is correct. Now the next statement talking about the Congress hearings on market manipulation which is also correct. We have this Robin Hood um Maripedia page, Wikipedia page, and it was saying that in February 2021, US Congress held hearings to investigate the trading activity surrounding GameStop. So that was correct. Um prestand so for now the postevent price stabilization and that was correct. We also have the we have the PDF of government documentation in here which mentions that after the pig stop stock price and trading volume stabilized through remained volatile. So this part is correct stabilization part. Now we have key points. So it say like short interest peak at 140% of float. Uh that was wrong. We have also the same thing. uh the government PDF page to verify that the GameStop short interest reach approximately 122.97 of the float. Um it's close but it's different. Now the retail trading volume increased 10fold during the squeeze. That's partially correct. Uh we also have the Wikipedia of Gam short squeeze to validate and a daily trading volume reached several hundred millions shares exceed pre-squeeze average by more than 10x. So well partially correct. Now the next next one is trading restriction implemented Robin Hood. So that part is correct. We have the we have the Texas law scholarship website with data to validate. And here was saying the Robin Hood imposed restrictions on trading GameStop during the peak of the short squ. So this part is this part is correct. They do have restrictions in post. Now we're moving on. Melvin capital losses at 40 53% requiring bailout. So this part is correct. We have the um here so we have the PDF uh of the case study and business law of the short gang stop short squiz and in here they mentioned that Melvin Capital lost approximately 53% of its asset due to scan stop short position so that part is correct and the last part is analysis fundamental value estimate $10 to 40 per share and we have realtors and we go in there. We go in there um in the article they mentioned that analysis maintain that the stock true value is significant lower average analyzis valition patch GameStop at around so 13.44 44 is within the range around that number. So I say that's partially correct, not entirely wrong like partially correct. Um moving on. So to involve in extensions, we can like looking for signs of game squiz in options market. Okay. Modeling how share sellers buy back shares using borrow lending simulations. Okay. analyze social media trends and online chatter to spot hardening behavior, you know, like Reddit, Google trends. There's a lot of things going on and that's what we can also look on and studying how trades during the day affect price movements and market mechanisms. So those are things that we can look into. So final reflect, the claim that GME traded at 0.04 04 in August 2020 20 is incorrect. Likely source of error like why it could be wrong is like misreading the split adjusted historical data can be one of the reasons and well for this corrections to the professor will say that after reviewing the primary market data from Yahoo Finance and stat news Jam Jimmy did not trade at 0.04 04 in August 20. The adjusted close on August 31, 2020 was approximately 1.67 with daily lows around 1.20 to 1.4t. So the full data tables and SEC fillings are available and if needed like those are the part that if they ask for more data we can like pro provide but yeah by far we confirm that the statement is wrong and we validate all the data here the key from the key points to the event timeline and everything and then also have pictures to support our information. Yeah and that's pretty much the video. Thank you for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"0:00
Today we'll be investigating the
0:01
GameStop stock and looking at the event
0:04
during 2020 and 2021 as a case study for
0:08
testing the efficient market hypothesis
0:10
and evaluating behavioral finance
0:12
explanations.
0:14
And we're going to be using the driver
0:16
framework to look at this analysis. And
0:18
I use Gemini to um create the code and
0:22
the outline, but I validated the outputs
0:26
and the analysis myself.
0:31
So first define and discover. So the
0:34
main objective for this analysis is to
0:37
determine which forms of market
0:39
efficiency were violated by the game
0:41
stock um price surge and the crash as
0:45
well. And so to anal and so to figure
0:48
this out, we're going to be using the
0:51
EMH and behavioral finance concepts.
0:54
So first we have to verify a fact. We
0:58
were given this fact to verify. GameStop
1:02
traded at 4 cents in August 2020. So, we
1:05
have to verify that. And through
1:08
research, we figured out that this
1:12
result is incorrect. And historical data
1:15
in August 2020 shows that the GameStop
1:18
stock was trading in the range of a
1:20
dollar 4 cents to $167.
1:25
and the closing price on the 31st of
1:28
August was $167.
1:31
So, we're going to document this
1:33
discrepancy in the data section of the
1:35
final report and state the accurate
1:37
price range. And the source that I use
1:39
for this was Yahoo Finance. And it's
1:41
important to um correct this fact since
1:44
the initial stock price as the baseline
1:46
for measuring abnormal results.
1:50
So, here's just a quick event timeline.
1:53
So in August 2020, we can see that GME
1:57
nears bankruptcy levels. And this is
2:00
relevant to EMH because this establishes
2:03
the fundamental value baseline of $10 to
2:06
$40 in our analyst range, but it could
2:08
also be potentially lower. And then in
2:11
September 2020, um Ryan Cohen acquires a
2:15
13% stake. And this public information
2:18
is used to test semi- strong EMH. And
2:21
then in January 2021,
2:24
uh this was a peak period for testing
2:27
abnormal returns and identifying
2:29
behavioral biases.
2:31
And then in the peak of January 2021,
2:34
the short interest peaked at 140%. And
2:38
this is a key market microstructure
2:39
anomaly.
2:41
And then again, this there was also
2:43
trading restrictions in trading apps
2:45
such as Robin Hood. And this shows
2:48
limits to arbitrage and market
2:50
microstructure failure. And then in
2:53
February 2021, there were congressional
2:55
hearings to talk about policy
2:57
implications and regulatory responses
3:00
due to market surges and then falls.
3:04
Now the represent stage. So we're going
3:07
to be looking at an analytical
3:08
methodology, an event study. And we're
3:11
going to use this methodology to
3:13
quantify market inefficiency by
3:14
calculating abnormal results.
3:17
abnormal returns. And so first, the
3:19
estimation window is going to be August
3:21
2019 to August 2020. And we're using
3:24
this time frame to estimate normal GME
3:27
risk for the beta. And then the event
3:29
window, so when everything was going on,
3:32
we're going to be looking at September
3:33
2020 to March 21st, 2021.
3:37
And this is the entire period where the
3:39
stock was rising and
3:42
everyone was investing. And the model
3:45
we're going to be using is the CAPM
3:46
model. And this model, we're going to
3:49
use this to require to um calculate
3:53
expected returns. And just real quick,
3:55
here's the formula for that.
3:58
And so the AR t is the abnormal return
4:02
and the cumulative abnormal return will
4:04
be the primary measure of sustained
4:06
market inefficiency.
4:08
So the plan to test this is we're going
4:10
to be looking at the EMH form, the core
4:12
test, the expected GME finding, and
4:15
we'll be looking at any violations as
4:17
well. And so the weak form, we're going
4:20
to be testing if C is significantly non
4:23
zero following the initial surge of the
4:25
stock. And we expect to see that the
4:29
rapid non-trendbased surge and crash
4:31
strongly suggest past prices had no
4:33
predictive power. And there is a
4:36
violation here because the systematic
4:37
pattern was not reflected in the price
4:39
history until the massive spike. And
4:42
then the next form semi- strong um we're
4:45
testing if the AR is non zero after
4:47
public events
4:49
such as the common sake and the news
4:52
about the interest surge. And so our
4:55
expected finding is that the price
4:57
search far beyond fundamental analyst
5:00
estimates for a sustained period based
5:02
on public short interest data and social
5:04
media shatter. So yes, there was also
5:06
violation for this one because public
5:09
information was misinterpreted um
5:11
leading to massive sustained mispricing
5:14
since there was a lot of misinformation
5:16
being spread around since a lot of
5:18
people were talking about it.
5:20
Next, the strong form. We're going to be
5:22
testing if hedge funds or insiders
5:24
profited or avoided losses
5:26
systematically.
5:28
And so our expected finding um Melbourne
5:30
Capital sustained a 53% loss and their
5:33
system prevented their insider knowledge
5:35
of short capacity or risk from
5:37
generating profit. And there could be a
5:39
violation here um if any group fails to
5:42
profit from private info. And the
5:45
violation here is due to misconstructure
5:47
limits and not any information
5:50
asymmetry. So now the implementation
5:53
stage. So to this stage will involve
5:56
data retrieval and statistical modeling
5:58
using Python. And so the first step data
6:02
retrieval and preparation we use the
6:04
Yahoo Finance library to download GME
6:07
and a market index and adjusted close
6:10
prices for the required windows.
6:13
and we'll be calculating log returns for
6:15
both of these assets
6:17
and then second event study execution
6:20
beta estimation. So we're going to be
6:23
running calculations to find alpha and
6:25
beta and then the ar and c calculation.
6:30
We'll apply the estimated alpha and
6:32
betas to the event window to calculate
6:34
um er ar and c.
6:39
And then statistical testing. The core
6:41
test is checking if the C at the peak um
6:44
the end of January 2021 is statistically
6:46
different from zero. And to do this,
6:48
we're going to be using a t test. And
6:50
then we'll look at the standard
6:52
deviation of AR from the estimation
6:54
period for this standard error
6:56
calculation. So here's the code. The
6:58
first step was to download everything
7:00
and to make sure the code was set up. So
7:02
it had the library of data that we were
7:05
going to use from Yahoo Finance. And
7:07
just to make sure that everything is
7:08
verified. So we can see here that setup
7:11
data fetch and price verification.
7:14
So here are parameters. We entered the
7:17
start date and then the end date. And
7:19
then fetch data. We downloaded the data
7:22
from Yahoo Finance. And then just
7:25
cleaning up that data as well. And so we
7:27
run that. We'll have downloaded all the
7:29
data. And then event two is the actual
7:31
calculations. So,
7:34
we're going to um define our event date,
7:37
so when it first started and then like
7:39
all the different surges of the stock
7:42
and then our parameters
7:45
and then here are
7:49
some equations to find the alpha and
7:52
betas before the event, during, all
7:55
that. And then
7:58
here are some more um calculations and
8:01
just data um inputs.
8:04
And then we also have a graph here just
8:06
to show how it changed over time the C.
8:10
And so when we run the code we have
8:12
these this is our results. So we can see
8:15
that in September 21st we had an alpha
8:19
of about.15
8:21
and then a beta of -23.
8:24
And we can see how that changed over
8:25
time. So over time the alpha slowly
8:28
decreased
8:30
while the beta increased.
8:33
And um we can see how the C at first it
8:37
was negative and then it went up and
8:38
then it went down again in January. And
8:42
this is just like after one day. So we
8:44
can see how even though it's just one
8:46
day the values changed a lot. And then
8:49
the mean AR at first it was negative
8:52
then it went up and then went down
8:53
again. And the C um it went up in
8:57
January and then down again a day later.
9:00
And so here's the graph that just shows
9:03
the changes in the C over these time
9:06
periods. So we can see how it decreased
9:10
but then increased in January.
9:13
And so based on the C values, we can
9:17
come to a conclusion to reject our null
9:20
hypothesis.
9:22
And so in September 21st, there was
9:25
significant inefficiency. So the price
9:27
was significantly lower than the
9:29
expected price showing a negative market
9:31
reaction or like continued pressure on
9:34
the stock.
9:36
And then there was also an inefficiency
9:38
again in January except this time it was
9:40
much higher. So the price was massively
9:42
and significantly higher than the
9:44
expected price precisely where the short
9:46
squeeze peaked and this is a severe
9:49
violation of the semi- strong EMH and
9:51
then in the day after this there was
9:54
also extreme efficiency and so despite a
9:58
slight drop from the 27th the market
9:59
remained severely mispriced with the car
10:01
being overwhelmingly positive and the t
10:04
stat being highly significant. So our
10:07
final conclusion for our calculated
10:09
values, all three event windows show a
10:12
statistically significant abnormal
10:13
return as the absolute value of the T
10:15
car is much greater than the critical
10:18
value of two. And this means that the
10:21
GME event provides strong quantitative
10:24
evidence that the semi-rong form of the
10:26
efficient market hypothesis was violated
10:28
during periods of high volatility and
10:30
confirming the need for a behavioral
10:32
finance explanation. So basically it
10:35
can't be explained that well using
10:37
mathematical equations and we'd have to
10:39
look at more of the events surrounding
10:43
this um time and we have to look at what
10:47
was going on during in society. So our
10:49
behavioral finance analysis we can look
10:51
at behavioral biases and the primary
10:53
driver was hurting fueled by the
10:56
availability heristic. So, social media
10:58
attention. If you're on social media and
11:01
you saw that the stock price is
11:03
increasing, this would motivate you and
11:06
others to invest in the stock as well to
11:08
obtain some of the benefits
11:12
and additionally intense overconfidence
11:15
by retail traders and their collective
11:16
ability. The initial short interest data
11:19
served as an anchor for the narrative.
11:22
Um there were also limits to the
11:24
arbitrage and this is the key EMH
11:27
defense. So rational arbitrators knew
11:30
that GME was overpriced but they
11:33
couldn't systematically profit because
11:35
of um variables like the noise trader
11:38
risk and implementation cost/market
11:41
microructure. Additionally, with
11:43
rational investor probability
11:45
um and X anti no rational investor could
11:48
have predicted the exact timing, scale
11:50
or duration of the squeeze. So
11:52
profitability was not systematic since
11:54
it happened all of a sudden and no one
11:57
really expected it to happen. And then
11:59
expost the astronomical returns were a
12:01
result of taking on extreme
12:03
non-diversifiable risk and the
12:06
volatility was so high that any positive
12:08
risk adjusted return for the peak buying
12:10
period would be extremely low.
12:12
suggesting that profits were largely
12:14
compensation for taking massive risk and
12:16
not exploiting a predictable arbitrage.
12:20
So some theoretical implications um
12:22
violation of the EMH. This large
12:25
statistically significant cumulative
12:27
abnormal return found during the GME
12:30
event um demonstrates a clear violation
12:32
of the semi- strong form of EMH
12:35
and the market price was sustained far
12:37
above its intrinsic value despite all
12:40
relevant information.
12:42
um such as um social media since it's
12:45
all public information.
12:48
And so just to um review, the behavioral
12:51
drivers that caused this were hurting.
12:55
And so investors collectively followed
12:57
the actions of the group to achieve a
12:59
shared goal. um the availability
13:02
horistic viral social media coverage
13:05
caused investors to overestimate the
13:07
profitability or the probability of
13:10
continued exponential returns and then
13:12
limits to arbitrage. So rational
13:14
investors could not correct the
13:15
mispricing due to high noise trader risk
13:19
and market microructure issues.
13:22
So now evolve the shift and theoretical
13:25
framework. So, EMH versus behavioral
13:27
finance framework. The GME event
13:30
highlights that markets are efficient
13:32
most of the time but can exhibit periods
13:34
of extreme pathological inefficiency.
13:37
And so, the price surge violates semi-
13:39
strong form because public information
13:41
has led to a sustained non-fundamental
13:43
price bubble. And the better explanation
13:46
for this scenario would be the
13:49
behavioral finance framework which
13:50
accommodates persistent mispricing when
13:53
limits to arbitrage are binding.
13:56
And so finally reflect um practical and
13:59
policy consequences active versus
14:02
passive management. This event provides
14:04
anecdotal evidence supporting active
14:06
management
14:08
um in particular the trend following and
14:10
momentum strategies driven by sentiment
14:13
but only for those with an extremely
14:15
high risk tolerance. For the majority of
14:17
capital, GME confirms that attempting to
14:20
chase these anomalies um is likely to
14:22
lead to losses supporting the long-term
14:24
viability of passive index investing.
14:28
And additionally, policy implications.
14:30
The event exposed critical
14:32
vulnerabilities in market
14:34
infrastructure,
14:35
particularly the settlement speed and
14:37
the opaque nature of short interest in
14:41
darkpool trading. And so policy
14:43
discussions now center on increasing
14:45
transparency and potentially speeding up
14:47
settlement times to prevent such
14:48
dramatic and disruptive failures of
14:50
market liquidity. This is my GME market
14:53
efficiency analysis using the driver
14:55
framework. Thank you.

Hello, I'm Alexandra and I'm
0:04
investigating market efficiency using
0:06
the GameStop um GME short squeeze of
0:10
2020 through 2021.
0:12
Our goal is to test the weak form
0:15
efficient market hypothesis which is
0:17
also known as EMH and quantify the I
0:21
mean quantify its failure using the
0:22
driver framework.
0:25
So
0:26
starting with um define and discover. So
0:29
under the EMH, the price should equal
0:31
the present value of future cash flows
0:33
discounted at a riskadjusted rate. And
0:37
the jump from approximately
0:40
um $4.50
0:42
to now $483 implies an impossible
0:46
present value increase um suggesting a
0:49
massive mispricing. So just for a
0:52
critical first step, we um did I did
0:55
some data verification and the
0:57
assignment 0.04 or 4 cents claim for
1:02
August 2020 is incorrect. My um code and
1:05
the um validation that I did looking up
1:08
and um using historic data
1:11
confirmed that the true range was um
1:13
approximately $4 to around $6. and we
1:17
wanted to use these values and proceed
1:19
using the verified data.
1:27
So starting um on the
1:31
represent as well as implement um I'm
1:33
going to do go to the collab to show
1:36
this.
1:40
So our analytical plan is so starting
1:43
with represent our analytical plan is an
1:44
event study and we'll use the CAPM um to
1:48
predict the normal return um which is
1:51
just ERI and then compare it to the
1:53
observed return and the difference um is
1:56
the abnormal return which is also known
1:58
as um ART and the core formula we are
2:01
testing is the calculation of the
2:03
abnormal return
2:05
um which is ART equals the R observed
2:08
minus E um RAR I and then going to the
2:13
collab.
2:16
So here is just defining parameters and
2:19
the imports and parameter setup. So
2:23
um we begin this implementation
2:27
by
2:29
implementation phase by executing the
2:33
calculate beta and expected return. So
2:36
this sh is shown under block two
2:41
which is the functions for EMH testing
2:43
in the um represent and implementation
2:46
stage. So here's the calculated
2:47
calculate beta and expected return and
2:50
there's that there and then um this the
2:54
calculate beta and expected return
2:55
function. This is the EMH prediction
2:57
model. And then
3:01
scrolling down a little bit.
3:09
So we have step one the OS regression.
3:12
Um and we can see that
3:16
shown at after we ran the code. Um it
3:19
gave us this um table as well as this
3:21
graph. But for the um OS regression, the
3:25
code executes OS regression on the
3:29
pre-event returns. And this um
3:31
statistical output shown here um is
3:34
crucial because it validates our EMH
3:36
prediction model. And um
3:40
we interested in the beta coefficient
3:42
which is found here in the coefficient
3:45
column right here and next to the market
3:47
return um RM. So shown right here.
3:52
And then my code estimates GME's
3:55
pre-event beta at 1.1375.
3:58
And this means GME was 1.1375
4:02
times more volatile than the market
4:05
confirming its high systematic risk. And
4:09
um furthermore, the t statistic shown
4:11
here right here of 5.001 001
4:16
confirms this beta is statistically
4:19
significant. And this beta is the
4:21
financial foundation of our EMH test.
4:26
And then um for step two, I wanted to do
4:29
an abnormal return calculation. So with
4:32
beta, the code moves to the event window
4:34
to calculate the daily abnormal returns.
4:37
So this is shown in the event study
4:39
analysis up here.
4:49
So we have our event study analysis
4:52
shown here
4:57
and then um what is calculating?
5:01
So
5:04
the code first determines the expected
5:06
return which is just ERRI using the
5:09
calculated beta and then it subtracts it
5:13
it then it subtracts this predicted
5:14
return from the observed return to get
5:16
the daily ART. Um
5:20
and then for step three we um had the
5:23
cumulative abnormal return which is also
5:26
C. So finally the code compounds these
5:30
daily ART values into the cumul
5:33
cumulative abnormal return also known as
5:35
CAR or C which quantifies the total
5:38
profit opportunity that existed outside
5:41
of the EMH model.
5:43
So for um
5:47
the validate and as well as the reflect
5:50
step. So I wanted to show the
5:55
final
5:56
output it had for
6:01
um the car graph or the cumulative
6:03
abnormal return graph. So we have the
6:05
graph here as well as this is just
6:08
validating market efficiency. So
6:12
the implementation yields the critical
6:13
output which is the C during the squeeze
6:17
being um 188.53%
6:21
and
6:23
shown there this um massive s sustained
6:26
positive C is direct quantifiable proof
6:29
of an EMH violation. So from a weak form
6:33
efficiency which is just historical
6:35
prices this is violated and the massive
6:38
C shows that historical data for an
6:40
example a high short interest was
6:42
predictive of future abnormal profits
6:45
and then we also have um looking at
6:47
semi-rong form efficiency which is just
6:49
public information. This has also been
6:51
violated. The price of $483 was
6:54
irrational compared to the fundamental
6:56
present value which is a range from $10
6:59
to $40 and public information was not
7:02
accurately priced
7:05
and then um
7:08
getting more um into the evolve as well
7:11
and as well as more of into the
7:13
reflection. Um so this is shown here as
7:16
well. But going back to the Google Docs.
7:24
So we worked through our implement in
7:25
our Google Collab and showed those
7:27
calculations as well as those formulas.
7:29
And then we also went through our um
7:31
validation and showed which were
7:34
violated being the semi- strong um form
7:38
as well as the weak form and um an
7:40
explanation for those and just getting
7:42
into the evolve as well as the
7:45
reflection here. So could a rational
7:49
profit s profit systematically? The
7:52
answer is no. The extreme risk means the
7:55
profits weren't risk-free. So we turned
7:57
to behavioral finance to explain the
8:00
anomalies
8:01
persistence and the C persisted due to
8:07
um hurting behavior which is
8:09
coordinating um coordinated buying and
8:11
as well as limit to arbitrage.
8:15
So rational investors couldn't short the
8:17
stock to force the price back to present
8:19
value because the risk of the squeeze
8:20
worsening was too high and the trade-off
8:23
was uneconomical. So in reflection um
8:27
going into the reflect stage as well um
8:31
the GME event was a spectacular
8:33
short-term failure of the weak and semi-
8:35
strong EMH and our analysis used the um
8:40
CAPM to quantify this failure with the C
8:43
while the statistical output um from the
8:46
OS regression shown in the collab
8:48
validated that risk level and then
8:52
I also wanted to mention that ultimately
8:56
while behavioral finance explains this
8:59
short-term craziness, the price
9:00
eventually collapsed back toward its
9:03
fundamental range. Um, and this confirms
9:06
that time value of money, um, principles
9:09
and fundamentals govern asset prices in
9:11
the long run. So, thank you so much and
9:14
that will be all.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, everyone.

My name is John Gashon.

In this video, I'll be walking through my market efficiency investigation using the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 through 2021. As a case study, I use the DRIVER framework to structure my analysis: define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect.

Through this notebook, I'll combine financial theory with Python-based empirical analysis to test whether the GameStop event violated market efficiency.

The first critical step is to verify the statement that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 against actual historical data. If incorrect, document the accurate figures and determine the appropriate approach for communicating this correction to the professor.

Next, here's our event timeline and some key points.

Let's go to my Google Colab code.

I started with some help from JGBT to set up the notebook. Here is my name and the code, along with the necessary imports for pulling financial data, and some helper functions.

We begin with DRIVER stage one: define and discover. The first step is to define the problem and verify the basic facts before running any models.

The prompt claimed that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020, so I pulled real data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Looking at the price data for August 2020, the lowest price was around $1, and the highest was about $1.40. Clearly, the claim that GME traded at $0.04 is incorrect. The stock was low, near bankruptcy levels, but not at pennies.

Right away, I verified the assumption and corrected the misinformation before moving forward. If this came up with the professor, I would politely correct it by citing verified Yahoo Finance data.

Next is DRIVER stage two: represent.

Now that I've defined the problem, the represent stage involves designing my analytical approach. Here, I outline how I'll test market efficiency using real data.

In this block, I downloaded full-year data for both GameStop and the S&P 500 regression, which estimates what GME's normal return should have been given market movements. You can see a sample of the merged dataset, with columns for GME returns and market returns.

I compare GME's actual returns to its expected returns to identify abnormal returns and then analyze the spikes during the short squeeze in January 2021.

Stage three is implement. This is where the modeling happens.

Here are my models and numbers, imported from Google Finance. Using CAPM, alpha is approximately 0.08 and beta is 1.74. I applied ordinary least squares regression from the statsmodels library to estimate the CAPM equation: expected return = alpha + beta × market return.

This means GameStop was about 74% more volatile than the market.

During the estimation period, the stock was very risky, but not surprising for a heavily shorted small-cap stock.

With these parameters, we can calculate expected returns around the event window and compute abnormal returns, which are the difference between what CAPM predicted and what actually occurred.

Abnormal returns were massive, especially from January 26th through January 29th, with daily returns exceeding 100% at one point. Cumulative abnormal returns peaked above 300%, far beyond what fundamentals could justify. These are clear outliers relative to normal market behavior.

The plots show this visually: the abnormal return line spikes dramatically during the short squeeze, then collapses just as quickly—a perfect example of extreme short-term inefficiency.

Stage four is validate. The validate stage tests the reliability of these results. I conducted a simple t-test on the average abnormal return to see if it was significantly different from zero. The t-statistic came out to 0.96, which technically isn't significant at the 5% level.

Formally, this suggests the market appears statistically efficient. However, the magnitude of the abnormal returns indicates that something unusual occurred. Numbers alone can't capture the chaotic behavior of that week.

In validation, I acknowledge that while traditional hypothesis tests might not reject the EMH, the economic reality clearly showed abnormal behavior.

Stage five is evolve. I expanded the analysis to include trading volume and behavioral factors. Here, I compare average trading volume before the squeeze to the week of the squeeze.

Between August 2020 and December 2020, GME's average daily volume was about 43 million shares. During the squeeze week, it exploded to over 447 million shares per day—a roughly tenfold increase.

This aligns with behavioral finance principles. It shows massive herd behavior, overconfidence, and FOMO, implied by social media platforms like Reddit. Retail traders coordinated—or at least followed each other—creating feedback loops that detached prices from fundamentals.

Even though it looked like free money, rational investors faced limits—they couldn't safely short the stock because of trading halts and margin requirements. This allowed inefficiency to persist longer than usual.

Stage six is reflect. In the reflect stage, I step back and connect everything to the efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance.

Summary: During the short squeeze, weak and semi-strong forms of market efficiency were violated. Prices didn't reflect historical data or new public information rationally. However, the strong form still held because insiders didn't consistently profit; gains were random and unstable.

Over time, the market corrected itself. Prices stabilized near estimates between $10 and $40 per share. This classic EMH reversion shows temporary mispricing followed by correction once rational traders returned.

From a policy and investor standpoint, this event reinforces the balance between behavioral and traditional efficient repricing. Even when markets look chaotic, they tend to restore equilibrium over time, supporting passive investing strategies and risk-based valuation models.

Through the DRIVER framework, I combined theory and data to test how real markets handle extreme events. The GameStop case shows that short-term inefficiencies can arise due to behavioral biases and coordination effects, but long-term efficiency generally prevails.

While EMH may not perfectly explain the chaos of January 2021, it still holds strong as a foundation of modern finance.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Ryan Gilbert, and in this video I'll be walking you through my DRIVER analysis of the GameStop short squeeze — one of the most fascinating real-world tests of market efficiency in recent history.

This project uses the DRIVER framework — Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Explain, and Reflect — to explore how the GameStop event of 2020–2021 challenged traditional views of market behavior.

D — DEFINE & DISCOVER

To start with the Define stage, my goal was to investigate whether the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH, held up during the GameStop short squeeze.

The Efficient Market Hypothesis basically says that stock prices fully reflect all available information. Under the semi-strong form, which I'll focus on here, public information should already be baked into prices — meaning you can't systematically beat the market just by reacting to news.

But in early 2021, GameStop — a struggling video game retailer — experienced an unprecedented event. Its stock surged from around four dollars in August 2020 to an intraday high of four hundred eighty-three dollars on January 28th, 2021. That's more than a 100-fold increase, fueled largely by retail traders on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets.

Before jumping into analysis, I verified the factual accuracy of one statement from the assignment: that ""GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020.""
That turned out to be incorrect — actual historical data from Yahoo Finance shows GameStop traded around 4 to 6 dollars per share during that time, not 0.04.

Documenting this correction first was important, because DRIVER emphasizes starting analysis with verified, accurate data.

From there, I defined my research questions:

Which form of market efficiency, if any, was violated during this event?

How quickly did prices incorporate public information?

Could rational investors have profited systematically?

And finally, to what extent can behavioral finance explain what happened?

R — REPRESENT

Moving into the Represent stage, I planned the entire analytical structure before writing any code.

My model is a market-adjusted return model, where the abnormal return equals the stock's daily return minus the market's daily return.
So mathematically, AR = R_gme – R_market.

I then defined two windows:
An estimation window from July through December 2020, which captures normal market conditions, and
An event window from mid-December 2020 through mid-February 2021, which covers the period leading up to, during, and after the squeeze.

The key metrics I planned to analyze were:

Daily abnormal returns (AR)

Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR)

Trading volume, to capture investor participation

I also noted qualitative factors to review, like Reddit sentiment, brokerage restrictions, and short interest levels.

All of this planning was documented in a simple Python dictionary I called ""PLAN,"" which stored the model, metrics, and windows. That made it clear that my Represent stage was fully completed before implementation, which is required by the framework.

I — IMPLEMENT

Now, in the Implement stage, I began executing the analysis in Python.

Here's what the code does, step by step:

First, I imported data for both GameStop and the S&P 500 using the yfinance library. I pulled adjusted closing prices and trading volume from June 2020 to March 2021.

Next, I calculated daily returns for each stock, merged the datasets, and computed abnormal returns as the difference between GameStop's return and the market's return.

Finally, I created a cumulative abnormal return column, or CAR, by summing the ARs across the event window.

What this does is isolate how much GameStop's performance deviated from what we'd expect based on the overall market.

In simpler terms — if the S&P went up one percent but GameStop went up twenty percent, that extra nineteen percent is the abnormal return.

This stage produced the data foundation for all further interpretation.

V — VALIDATE

The Validate stage is where I checked statistical significance and visualized the results.

Using Python's scipy.stats, I performed simple t-tests to see whether the event-day abnormal return was statistically extreme compared to GameStop's normal returns from the estimation period.

On January 28, 2021, the abnormal return was roughly +134 percent — more than two standard deviations beyond anything seen before the event.

That's astronomically high, and the p-value was effectively zero — meaning this movement was far too large to be explained by normal variation or by the market overall.

I also looked at the five-day cumulative abnormal return window from two days before to two days after the event. CAR peaked at around +80 percent, then began to fall as prices corrected.

Plotting price, CAR, and trading volume revealed a clear pattern:

A vertical spike on January 27th and 28th

A huge surge in trading volume — roughly ten times the baseline

A steep decline after trading restrictions took effect

These visuals validated the quantitative findings and illustrated how abnormal the event was.

E — EXPLAIN

Now for the Explain stage — this is where we interpret what those numbers actually mean.

Market Efficiency Testing:
Weak-form efficiency, which assumes prices reflect all past data, was violated because clear momentum patterns appeared.
Semi-strong efficiency, which assumes all public info is already priced in, was also violated. Everyone knew about the high short interest and Reddit coordination, yet prices still exploded.
Strong-form efficiency, which assumes even insider information is priced in, likely still held — there's no evidence of insider trading advantage.

Behavioral Finance:
The behavioral side explains much of this better than EMH.
Retail investors displayed several key biases:

Herding behavior, as thousands of Reddit users coordinated buys

Overconfidence, believing they could outsmart institutions

Representativeness bias, viewing the trade as a cultural rebellion, not an investment

Confirmation bias, where traders focused only on posts supporting their beliefs

Social media amplified these biases. The ""diamond hands"" narrative created a collective illusion of control, while limits to arbitrage — like short-sale constraints and brokerage halts — prevented rational investors from correcting the mispricing quickly.

Rational Investor Profitability:
From a rational standpoint, the opportunity to profit systematically was extremely limited.
Ex-ante — meaning before the event — the magnitude and timing were unpredictable.
Ex-post — meaning after the fact — we can identify profitable moments, but those can't be reliably replicated.
Even those who profited took enormous risk; volatility exceeded 250 percent annualized, and late entrants saw negative risk-adjusted returns.
So while some individuals made fortunes, there was no repeatable or systematic way to exploit the inefficiency.

R — REFLECT

Finally, the Reflect stage focuses on insights, implications, and limitations.

From a theoretical perspective, the GameStop case shows that markets can temporarily fail the assumptions of semi-strong efficiency, especially when collective behavior overwhelms fundamentals.

However, it also shows that markets are self-correcting.
Within weeks, GameStop's price stabilized around 40 to 50 dollars — still above its pre-event levels, but far below the irrational peak.

This suggests that efficiency is not binary — it can break down briefly but tends to re-emerge as rational forces return.

In terms of management and policy implications:
For regulators, this event highlighted the need for clearer transparency around trading restrictions and clearinghouse requirements.
For investors, it reinforces the importance of risk management and skepticism toward social-media-driven narratives.
And for researchers, it demonstrates that behavioral factors can coexist with efficient markets — efficiency isn't destroyed, it's just interrupted.

To wrap up, my analysis found that the GameStop short squeeze represented a temporary violation of the semi-strong form of market efficiency, driven by social media coordination and behavioral biases.
Yet, the market corrected itself quickly, showing that while psychology can dominate in the short run, fundamentals still win in the long run.

That concludes my DRIVER analysis.
Thank you for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Okay, so I plug Okay, this is my maybe
fourth or fifth time plugging this in
Gemini. Not going to lie, I I don't know
what was going on. My Gemini was just
giving me a bunch of weird answers. Like
a bunch of really weird responses. Like
here's my one from above. This is like
my fifth time. It only gave me the two
stages. So I finally got a a good
response and I finally found a good
prompt that gave me So let me just go
through this. Um
so our overview is we're going to
investigate the market efficiency using
uh GameStop uh the short squeeze event
of 2020 to 2021. Um as our case study um
we're going to verify the accuracy of
stated facts, analyze the price behavior
relative to the uh efficient market
hypothesis predictions and evaluate
whether market anomalies constitute
evidence against um market efficiency or
can be explained um within uh existing
frameworks. And just starting here right
where it says verify the statement.
GameStop uh from what I found in August
2020 which I can show you here and I'll
show you again later. Um August of 2020
is right here. GameStop was not traded
at 4 cents. It was traded at about a
dollar maybe a little bit over a dollar.
Um but on average just about around a
dollar 10 cents max. Um
sorry.
So that's where we start. Um, and yeah,
so our event timeline is in August 2020,
GM uh GME nearly goes uh is near
bankrupt levels. Ryan Cohen, the Chewy
founder, acquires 13% stake, which did
happen. Um, the price was driven up to
$483. Congressional hearings on the
market manipulation and then as in
February 2021 and the present, we have
postevent uh price stabilization. There
are key points. The short interest
peaked at 140 uh 140% a float. retailing
retail trading volume increased tfold.
Uh trading restrictions implemented at
the peak a hedge fund um Melvin Capital
sustained 50 53% loss requiring bailout
um analyst fundamental values estimate
$10 to $40 per share. So I plugged all
that in Gemini. They gave us our
prediction goal to investigate the
efficiency market hypothesis or the EMH
using the 2020 2021 GameStop short
squeeze as a case study. the the
analysis will it says the analysis will
verify factual data which is what it'll
show later. Um
so the first step of verification goes
through it's uh this should be in the
validation stage technically but it's
kind of here just defining it I guess so
I guess it would be both. Um the first
step is to verify as it says so as I
said and as I showed GameStock did not
trade at 4 cents. It's incorrect. it.
This says that it traded in April of
2020 at $257,
but this says
in April it traded at about $130, $140.
So that's also incorrect, but it's
close. It's still somewhat correct. Um,
and
so that's inaccurate. So then let's go
to the represent stage. Um, this
represent stage kind of gave us just
what we're going to do. It imp the
implement and what and the fact
verification that we're going to have
talking about the 483 price peak and all
that. It's going to do all that later.
And once they implement the EMH analysis
to test GME against the three forms of
market efficiency. So the weak form, the
semi- strong form, which in the original
output that I got was the base form. So,
and then the strong form,
excuse me. And then it wants us to
implement um behavioral analysis and
talk about the rational investors and if
they could make money or not and apply
our behavioral finance con uh finance
concept
and then validate and reflect. So that's
what we're going to go through. So
implement I think that this part should
have been in the validation stage but I
think it makes sense too. Here um they
are confirming that this stake of 13%
was correct. It did happen. He disclosed
near 10% stake in September 2020 and
then it jumped up to 13% in December. Um
so that's correct. The price peak of 8
or 483 is confirmed um in January 28th
of 2021. Uh the short interest is
greater than 140%. So that's also
correct. Um as given from this data and
other public findings um the capital
loss was confirmed. the hedge fund which
held a large portion lost 53% and they
needed a $2.75 billion bailout and uh
the estimation of $10 to $40 per share
during the event is also true.
So yeah, that's all that I feel like
that should have been in the validation
stage just to kind of show that it's
true, but that's okay. And then moving
on, like I said, my Gemini was being
really weird. And then um moving on they
provided a powerful case it says on all
three. So this is where the implement
comes in implementing the the three uh
em
systems. So um the prediction is that
they pass trading data and they have no
predictive power. Um this was violated
as it says
excuse me retail investors uh led by
figures like different figures led this
um they use data to predict and
coordinate buying effort
and then the semi strong um EMH
violation. Uh the prediction is that all
publicly a available information is
instantly reflected in the price. Um
this is not true. Uh it says that the
price peaked at $483, but the analysts
targeted $10 to $40 per share. So
obviously the um price was way higher
than what they thought. And this is not
true. And they violated this because
they said that it was going to be um
low, very low, and then they just bumped
all the way up and it detached from
public reality. And it was just not
realistic at all. And then the strong
form, the prediction was that all
private and public um is in the price.
Even insiders cannot profit. It says
this is likely violated while because of
the squeeze. Uh they say brokers like
Robin Hood restricted buying. Um the
distinction was private information. So
they're saying that they did not the
public and private information. They
didn't tell everyone. Um there was
advanced knowledge and they said that
people could be profiting. So it's
possible that people were profiting off
them off this like inside of trading and
stuff like that or broker risk managers
as it says. So, it's not technically
confirmed, but it's more than likely
that people were. I mean, if you have
all this information, I'm not why would
you not cuz that's not ethical, but some
people would say it and think like that.
Um,
so yeah, rational investors failed.
Um, because the market was supposedly
overpriced at 483 stock. Um, they it
says rational arbitrators should have
shorted the overpriced stock back to
what it was low. they failed and the
capitals the Melvin Capitals lost their
money. Um
the failure is uh perfectly explained by
noise trade implementation costs and
forced liquidation. They the forced
liquidation is that they um needed a
bail and they needed $2.75 billion
because they didn't have their money and
they need to buy um they were supposed
to buy back their shares.
Then this is all kind of just other
things. The validation stage as we
talked about before um it kind of here
it kind of just talks about how the
accuracy all the factual claims are
verified. The initial four cents was an
er error was corrected. All their key
data was um corrected and all other data
key data was shown. Um the logic is
consistent. It kind of the failure of
the rational investors um serves as
evidence that limits the limits the
argument. um the success of Wall Street
on Reddit thesis as a direct evidence
against the weak form completeness all
components of the required analysis that
I was given were complete even though it
didn't give me an evolved stage here but
I would just say that kind of it kind of
implemented it in other places evolving
its own argument and invol evolving kind
of like what is shown and then on the
reflect um
the GME event means for the EMH
GameStock did not prove that the
efficient market hypothesis uh is an um
academic model. It serves it uh it
serves for real world case studies and
critical or it has critical limitations.
Uh it provides it proves that the market
can remain in insufficient for long
longer rather than rational
can uh remain solvent. Um the key
insight that it gave me here is uh event
highlights that market efficiency is not
a constant at a constant state. It's
it's in a fragile equilibrium
equilibrium. So it's kind of saying that
like um the market's always in the shift
no matter what no matter what changes.
Uh
so yeah some people have more capital
and more risk tolerance rather than the
noise traders. So like some people can
take on all that money and take on all
that risk while others cannot.
um driver framework was essent essential
to what was given
and I would say what was the last
question that we were meant to answer.
Give me one second.
Um I would say is it was possible for
people to make money off this um if they
would have taken other key steps that
they did not take like shorting the
stock or like doing other things.
However though, as history proved, there
was a lot of things that a lot of
reasons that people lost money. So yeah,
that was what my Gemini gave me. I'm not
gonna lie, it was a little bit hard to
understand. So, I hope I explained it
enough or I hope I explained it. I
explained it as best as I could. So,

Hi, my name is Manisa and today my task
0:04
was to analyze the GameStop short
0:06
squeeze event which covers a period from
0:08
2020 and onwards and my analysis
0:11
includes the his verifying the
0:13
historical GME stock data visualizing
0:15
price and volume trends with key event
0:17
annotations and then discussing short
0:19
speech dynamics with provided data
0:22
points and evaluating weak form and
0:23
semi-strong form market efficiency and
0:26
then discussing them and then assessing
0:28
systematic profitability for ratio
0:30
rational investors and then exploring
0:32
behavioral finance explanations for
0:34
observed anomalies and then I'll
0:35
conclude with a comprehensive summary
0:37
addressing all aspects of the analysis.
0:40
So here I am fetching the his GME
0:43
historical data and I'm ensuring that
0:45
the Y finance library is installed and
0:47
imported which is required for fetching
0:49
stock data and then I do this. So I
0:52
fetch the data using f y finance.d
0:55
download starting from 2020 and store it
0:57
in a pandas data frame and then I
0:59
display the first few rows to verify the
1:01
data structure and the content and the
1:03
GME data frame currently has multi-level
1:04
column names which will can be
1:06
cumbersome for plotting and analysis and
1:09
flattening these column names to a
1:10
single more accessible level will
1:12
simplify future operations. So I
1:15
verified the 2020 August 2020 price. So
1:18
first I'll filter the GME data to
1:20
include only on entries for August 20th
1:22
and then isolate the relevant time
1:23
period for price verification.
1:26
Now that the data for 2020 is filtered,
1:28
I will extract the relevant price
1:30
columns and then calculate and print the
1:33
minimum and maximum values for these
1:34
prices to verify the statement about
1:36
GME's trading price.
1:39
And here are the minimum and maximum
1:41
values. So now I'm going to visualize
1:43
GME price and the volume trends. So I
1:45
created the plot showing GME historical
1:48
stock price and trading volume over the
1:49
relevant period and then I marked and
1:51
annotated key events from the provided
1:53
timeline and then so basically here's
1:56
the reasoning for my code. I need to
1:57
generate a plot that visualizes GME
1:59
historical stock price and trading
2:00
volumes along with annotations for key
2:02
events. And this will involve plotting
2:03
libraries, creating subplots, plotting
2:05
the data, adding event markers and label
2:07
labels, and ensuring that the plot is
2:09
well formatted and readable.
2:11
And here's the GME stock price and all
2:13
new trends with key event annotations.
2:18
So then I analyzed the uh short squeeze
2:20
dynamics and basically
2:26
uh the trading volume clearly
2:29
illustrates the extraordinary events
2:30
that unfolded particularly in January
2:32
and February and the short squeeze
2:35
feedback loop. As the price began to
2:37
climb due to retail buying, the short
2:39
sellers faced increasing marginal margin
2:41
calls and mounting losses. And to
2:43
mitigate these, they were forced to
2:44
cover their short positions, which
2:46
involves buying back shares they had
2:48
borrowed and sold. And the short
2:49
covering created a very powerful
2:51
feedback loop of increased buying,
2:53
further price increase, and then more
2:54
pressure on shorts. And this vicious
2:57
psycho is evident in the plot as the
2:59
blue line skyrockets upward in late 2021
3:02
and the trading volume simultaneously
3:04
explodes to unprecedented levels. The
3:06
events of this February to 21 uh fee
3:08
January to February 21 demonstrate how a
3:11
highly shorted stock combined with the
3:13
coordinated influx of buying pressure
3:15
can lead to a parabolic price movement
3:17
as short sellers are forced to liquidate
3:18
their positions. And then I evaluated
3:21
big form efficiency. So to analyze GM's
3:24
past movements, past uh price movements
3:27
and assess weak form market efficiency,
3:28
the first step is to calculate the daily
3:30
logarithmic returns of the GM closing
3:32
price and these are preferred for
3:33
financial time series analysis as
3:34
they're addictive over time and better
3:36
reflect continuous compounding and then
3:39
the daily logarith uh logarithmic
3:41
returns have been calculated. I will
3:43
compute the um autocorrelation function
3:45
ACF of these returns and plot it to
3:47
visualize the correlation of returns
3:48
with their past values and this will
3:50
identify any discernable patterns or can
3:52
indicate a violation of weak for market
3:54
form efficiency and here's that graph.
3:57
So the ACF plot shows that it's
4:00
basically a crucial tool for assessing
4:01
weak form market efficiency and based on
4:04
this plot the daily returns appear to be
4:06
independent and randomly distributed.
4:08
The lack of significant autocorrelations
4:10
across most Slack suggests that the past
4:12
price movements cannot re reliably
4:15
predict future price movements for GME.
4:17
Therefore, the analysis of daily returns
4:19
through the ACF plot generally supports
4:20
a notion of weak for market efficiency
4:22
for GME. This implies that technical
4:24
analysis which relies on historical
4:26
price patterns to forecast future prices
4:28
would not likely not be consistently
4:30
profitable in this market after
4:32
accounting for trading costs. And then I
4:34
evaluated semi-strong form efficiency.
4:36
So I compared the observed past behavior
4:38
during the short squeeze especially the
4:40
surge to 483 against publicly available
4:43
information such as analyst fundamental
4:45
value estimates which is 10 to 40 per
4:47
share and then I assess whether new
4:49
public information was immediately or
4:50
full and fully reflected in the stock
4:52
price and from that analysis I got that
4:54
the GM short squeeze event particularly
4:56
search to um 483 against the estimates
5:00
of 10 to 40 represents a clear violation
5:02
of semi strong form market effic
5:04
efficiency and And the reason for the
5:07
violation is that the semi-strong market
5:09
uh semi-rong form efficiency posits that
5:11
all publicly available information is
5:13
already incorporated into the stock
5:14
price. Meaning that investors cannot
5:16
consistently earn abnormal returns by
5:18
analyzing public data. In the case of
5:20
GME, the price drastically overshot any
5:22
reasonable fundamental valuation based
5:24
on publicly available analyst reports
5:26
and company information. An investor who
5:28
is acting solely on the publicly known
5:30
fundamental value of 10 to 40 would have
5:31
been entirely misled by the market price
5:33
action and the ability of certain
5:35
investors to profit immensely from the
5:37
pure technical and sentimentdriven
5:39
squeeze independent of fundamental
5:41
public information contradicts the core
5:43
tenet of semi-strong form efficiency. So
5:45
while the market is eventually corrected
5:48
the period of extreme mediation
5:49
indicates that the publicly available
5:50
information was not the primary driver
5:52
of price and was certainly not
5:55
immediately and fully reflected.
5:57
So next I evaluated the strong form
6:00
efficiency where I discussed strong form
6:02
market efficiency in the context of GME
6:04
considering whether any participants
6:06
would have systematically profited using
6:08
private non-public information and
6:10
acknowledge the difficulty of empirical
6:12
testing without access to insider data.
6:15
So
6:16
it is important to emphasize that
6:18
primary driver primary drivers of GMA
6:20
squeeze were public information and
6:21
specific market mechanics and the
6:23
question of whether any informations
6:25
exploited truly non-public information
6:26
for systematic gain remains largely
6:29
answerable for an external datadriven
6:31
analysis while suspicions of insider
6:33
training may arise during such unusual
6:35
market fence proving them require access
6:38
to internal private data that's behind
6:40
beyond the scope of the analysis that
6:42
I'm doing and then I assess test the
6:45
systematic profitability for rational
6:47
investors and I concluded that
6:49
systematic profit profitability was not
6:52
feasible. The extraordinary market
6:55
dynamics driven by the unprecedented
6:57
combination of short interest social
7:00
media coordination and herd behavior let
7:01
it price movements from fundamental
7:03
value and traditional market indicators.
7:05
The event highlights that the
7:06
limitations of traditional market
7:07
efficiency assumptions in the face of
7:09
external extreme behavioral anomalies
7:12
and collective action. And then I
7:14
explored the behavioral finance
7:15
explanations.
7:17
And I concluded that the GME shorts
7:19
cannot be adequately explained by
7:21
rational assumptions of the efficient
7:23
market hypothesis. And instead it
7:26
reveals like a complex interplay of
7:27
human psychology that led to an an
7:30
anomalous
7:32
price surge and a significant albeit
7:34
temporary deviation from fundamental
7:36
valuations. And then
7:41
I concluded also that the GM short space
7:43
cannot be explained by rational
7:45
assumptions of the efficient market
7:46
hypothesis.
7:53
And then for I finally summarized
7:56
everything and I basically the insight
7:59
that I received is that the GME short
8:01
squeeze serves as a pivotal case study
8:03
in illustrating how extreme behavior
8:05
phenomena and market micro structure can
8:07
override traditional financial theories
8:08
and fundamental valuations leading to
8:10
significant market anomalies. And future
8:12
research could investigate the long-term
8:14
impact of social mediadriven collective
8:15
action on market stability and explore
8:18
potential regulatory frameworks to
8:20
address such events, balancing marketing
8:22
freedom with investor protection. Thank
8:24
you.

Hello everyone. My name is Abby
0:03
Goldstein and this is session 8
0:05
assignment. Um, and today we're tackling
0:08
one of the most famous market anomalies
0:10
of the modern era, which is the 2020 to
0:12
2021 GameStop short squeeze. Um, our
0:16
assignment was to analyze this event
0:17
using the driver framework to test the
0:19
core assumptions of the efficient market
0:21
hypothesis or the EMH um, and see if the
0:25
market truly is rational.
0:28
Before we proceed, the critical first
0:30
step under verify was to check um the
0:33
stated fact that the GME traded at 0.04
0:37
in August 2020. So, I'm going to run my
0:41
code
0:43
and you can see that um the this box
0:46
right here um stated that this fact is
0:49
incorrect. Um based on our code
0:51
verification using the split adjusted
0:54
historical data, the lowest closing
0:56
price for GME during August of 2020 um
0:59
was approximately $14 and this is 25
1:04
times um the stated figure. Now the
1:07
define in review stages um the problem
1:10
is pretty simple. Um, how did a
1:12
struggling uh video game retailer with a
1:15
fundamental value estimated between $10
1:18
and $40 per share? Um, reach an
1:21
astonishing price of nearly $483.
1:25
Um, this massive disconnect is the
1:28
anomaly we are investigating.
1:31
Um, so the key fa uh the key facts um
1:33
laid out in our code respiratory output
1:36
um confirm the events mechanics. uh the
1:39
short interest meaning the bet the bets
1:41
against the company peaked at an extreme
1:44
140% of the public share float. This
1:48
created the mechanical potential for the
1:50
squeeze. Um next the price surge was
1:53
driven by an unpreented uh precedented
1:56
10-fold increase in retail trading
1:58
volume uh coordinated largely through
2:01
platforms like Reddit
2:03
just stated right here. Oops.
2:08
Now for the investigation um phase we uh
2:13
we were to test the three forms of
2:15
market efficiency. Uh the GME short
2:18
squeeze appears to violate at least two
2:20
of these forms. So the weak form EMH um
2:24
this form states you can't profit from
2:26
looking at past prices. Uh the GME uh
2:29
event challenges this because the
2:31
extreme short interest arguably created
2:33
a predictable target.
2:36
If we assume the short percentage was
2:37
the information, um the market was
2:40
arguably inefficient in the runup to the
2:43
squeeze.
2:45
Now, the semi strong uh form, EMH, this
2:49
form states that prices reflect all
2:51
public information. Um this is the
2:53
biggest failure point. The price peak of
2:56
$483
2:57
far exceeded the analysis consensus of
3:00
the $10 to $40 share price. um showing
3:04
the market was widely overrated to the
3:07
public news of a potential company
3:09
turnaround. Um next was the strong form.
3:13
Uh this form states that even private
3:15
information and market structure uh
3:17
can't be exploited.
3:19
Uh the controversial trading
3:21
restrictions imposed um by brokers like
3:24
Robin Hood raise a profound question
3:26
here. When retail investors were
3:28
suddenly restricted from buying, it
3:30
suggested unequal access to market
3:33
execution um which is structural
3:35
violation of strong efficiency.
3:38
To explain the anomaly, we must look
3:40
beyond traditional finance and into
3:43
behavioral uh finance. uh the rational
3:46
uh mechanism. The core short squeeze was
3:49
rational um mechanical function of uh
3:52
the core short squeeze was a rational
3:54
mechanical function of the high short
3:57
interest.
3:58
Short sell shell short short sellers uh
4:01
were mathematically forced to buy back
4:03
shares to limit losses uh driving the
4:06
price up. Next was the behavioral
4:09
amplification. Um the sheer magnitude
4:11
was driven by emotion. Our analysis
4:14
points to three key behavioral anal uh
4:17
biases. Um hurting, which is investors
4:19
following the crowd on Reddit. Uh
4:22
sentiment-driven trading, which was
4:24
trades um motivated by anti-Wall Street
4:27
uh sentiment rather than profit. Um and
4:29
then information cascade was people
4:32
bought because other people were buying
4:34
um creating a self uh self-fulfilling
4:37
price bubble. In conclusion, the
4:40
GameStop event demonstrates that markets
4:42
are complex. Um, the GME short squeeze
4:45
did not entirely disapprove the EMH. Um,
4:48
but it did expose the fragilityity of
4:51
semi- strong and the strong forms in the
4:53
EMH. Our recommendation is that the GME
4:57
uh anomaly is best understood as a
4:59
rational market mechanic which is the
5:01
short squeeze um amplified to an
5:04
irrational extent by coordinated
5:06
behavioral finance biases. Um this event
5:09
proves that while markets may be
5:11
efficient over long-term short-term
5:14
efficiencies driven by retail
5:16
coordination and emotion can have a
5:18
massive systematic impact. Um and this
5:21
was my assignment. Thank you guys for
5:23

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,759
efficiency investigation.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay, so for this assignment we are uh

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,480
going over the GameStop short squeeze

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,199
event of 2020 to 2021.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,679
And basically what we're trying to

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,440
understand is if the GME meaning

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,320
GameStop situation behave the way

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,719
efficient market the efficient market

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,680
hypothesis or the EMH says a stock uh

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,960
should behave. So our job for this

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,840
assignment is to verify the facts to

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
analyze price behavior to compare it to

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
EMH predictions.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,000
uh to decide if the anomalies truly

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
break EMH or if EMH can still explain

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,120
them with real world limitations and

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,240
also evaluate whether a rational

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,400
investor could have made systematic

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,200
profit uh out of this event. Okay. So

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,479
first uh obviously we have to go over

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,840
some some of the important terms. Uh

25
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,799
first the efficient market hypothesis or

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,840
EMH. It says that prices reflect

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,960
information efficiently. So you can't

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,479
consistently beat the market and it has

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,479
three forms. The weak form of EMH which

30
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,759
reflects all past price data. the semi-

31
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,560
strong form of EMH which prices reflect

32
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,320
all public information and the strong

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,200
form of EMH where prices reflect all

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,040
information including insider

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,960
information. Uh here GME mainly

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:02,399
challenges the semi strong form of EMH.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,759
First obviously we have to go over uh

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,319
all of the terms and what is uh the

39
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,039
information that we are given. This is

40
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,920
obviously the define and discover or the

41
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,239
D stage in our driver analysis as we can

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,840
see here in our driver analysis

43
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
document.

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,080
uh the defined stage we know what our

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,680
objective is and the critical initial

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:33,040
question which states that GME traded at

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,959
zero at 4 cents in August 2020.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,400
Um because this value appears

49
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,959
suspiciously low uh I obviously need to

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
verify it. So I went and verified the

51
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,000
value and we'll obviously talk more

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,879
about this later but uh it's not true.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,680
It's not true. GME did not trade at 4

54
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,360
cents in August 2020. It was a bit

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,080
higher than that. And as we can see here

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
as I go over in the document some other

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,840
key concepts that we need to understand

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,400
uh before the analysis is the short

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,519
interest which is the percentage of sale

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,480
of shares sold short which is more than

61
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,720
100% which indicates extreme crowding

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,680
and creates conditions for a squeeze

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,239
such as a GME. Then this short squeeze

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
which is a rapid price increase caused

65
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,959
by short sellers forced to buy shares

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,560
back and abnormal returns which are

67
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,239
daily returns uh far be typ far beyond

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,920
typical market movements.

69
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,959
Um, also here in the information that

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,560
we're given, uh, the timeline, it's

71
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,360
just, I mean, it's not really key each

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,640
of these events, but we still have to go

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,920
over them. In August 2020, GME is near

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,480
bankruptcy levels. Uh, then in September

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,040
2020, Ryan Cohen, who is a Chewy

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,720
founder, acquires 13% stake of Gamestock

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,599
share. uh which this one is important to

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,840
know which is this is positive public

79
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,120
information. Then in January 2021,

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,120
Wall Street Bets uh drives price surge

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,400
to a high of $483.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,479
So a nonfundament nonfunddamental price

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
explosion.

84
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,520
Then in February 2021, there are

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
congressional hearings on the market

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
manipulation

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
uh which says that trading restrictions

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,240
and hearings create the market a a

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,080
market structure shock.

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,479
And then we have other key data points

91
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,400
that we have to go over before actually

92
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:52,080
starting the the analysis is that the

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,560
short interest peaked at 100% off float

94
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
which means that more shares were sold

95
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
than actually existed.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,759
Uh which is exactly the setup where the

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,800
short squeeze becomes mechanically

98
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,639
possible. Uh of course EMH doesn't

99
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,639
naturally predict this kind of

100
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,280
structural imbalance.

101
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:17,039
Then here that is a t-fold retail volume

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,120
spike shows a lot of behavioral forces

103
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,919
uh behavioral forces such as hurting uh

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,479
fear of missing out and narrative driven

105
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,000
training which is helpful for expl for

106
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,960
explaining price behavior outside the

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,120
fundamentals. Again connecting to the

108
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,560
efficient market market hypothesis

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
there were trading restrictions

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,360
implemented at the peak by Robin Hood

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,280
um which is that uh I mean I'm me

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
personally I'm interested in the topic

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,840
and I watched uh the movie about this uh

114
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,400
a couple couple months ago and Robin

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,240
Hood deactivated the sell button for

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,160
uh the GME talk right when it was at its

117
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
peak. So there were trading restrictions

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,120
implemented and then they went to court

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
for that. Well, it was this whole thing.

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,319
Uh but this means that prices during

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,199
restriction periods cannot cannot be

122
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,199
analyzed as free market prices because

123
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
there were restrictions.

124
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,520
Uh we know that hedge fund Melvin

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,039
Capital sustained 53% losses requiring a

126
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319
bailout

127
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,880
which shows limits to arbitrage. Even

128
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
even professionals can always correct

129
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,680
mispricing and this concept is directly

130
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,080
relevant to the semi-rong form and the

131
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,319
strong form of EMH.

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,600
And then analyst fundamental value

133
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,199
estimates $10 to $40 per share is kind

134
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,919
of a benchmark. Uh comparing this range

135
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,960
to the price spikes helps us evaluate

136
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,319
irrational price movement and whether

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,639
any portion of the surge reflects real

138
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,319
business prospects.

139
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,479
Okay. So, um, after I went over all of

140
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,199
this information in my driver document

141
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,000
right here, then I went onto the

142
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
represent stage,

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,039
uh, and I just planned out what I was

144
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,639
going to do before the implement stage.

145
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,720
Uh

146
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,039
uh first some fact verification.

147
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,639
Download the GME historical data. Print

148
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,880
the data in the August 2020 prices. Uh

149
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,199
confirm whether the 4 cent claim is

150
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,479
accurate. Then price and volume

151
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,960
visualization. A daily returns analysis,

152
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,240
event window analysis,

153
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,800
uh benchmarking and trading strategy

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
examples. uh I just planned out

155
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
everything I was going to do right here

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,039
in the document before actually

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,720
implementing it. Then once I knew what I

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,800
needed, I went over here to uh Google

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Gemini and I uh gave it a this pretty

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
long prompt because we I I wanted to go

161
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
in deep in detail and in depth. So I

162
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,560
gave it a prompt uh to write a Python

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,199
code uh completing all of the

164
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,199
information that I know I needed and at

165
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:20,160
the end this is uh the code in code app

166
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,479
that it gave me here just obviously uh

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,919
goes all over the code and then the the

168
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,199
response uh starts here. The first thing

169
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,680
we can see is the

170
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,279
step one uh GME uh download and

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,080
verification.

172
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,719
Uh the code downloaded

173
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,800
uh the

174
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:52,640
data of the stock prices for Gamestock

175
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,279
uh on August to verify if

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,680
it was actually worth $0.04. 04 on

177
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,519
August. And here we can see that it is

178
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:11,120
not true. It's not true. Um this this

179
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:15,360
top panel shows the first couple days of

180
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,560
of the of the of the month.

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,360
uh the close price, the high price, the

182
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,640
low price, and the open price, as well

183
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,000
as the volume for the uh Gamestock

184
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,560
share. And we can see that the lowest

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
price in period was $14.

186
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Uh not just 4, so it was higher, which

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,399
is which shows why it's really important

188
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,959
to verify your information before

189
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,800
actually trying to do any work with it.

190
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,959
Uh

191
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
and then it also tells us that the

192
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:55,000
maximum Gamestock close price in the

193
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,000
period was uh of $8688.

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,040
Uh however, this was obviously it was

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,839
not in August 2020. It was in uh it was

196
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:09,760
the 27th of January of 2021,

197
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,360
which is where the short the short

198
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
squeeze occurred, but we'll talk about

199
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,959
that later. Right now we're just uh

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
verifying the 4 cent claim. Here in the

201
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:24,079
second panel we have the data for all

202
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:28,000
the all the days of August. And indeed

203
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,560
uh it never is 4 cents. The the lowest

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,760
it gets is $14.

205
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,680
So we know that that is not true. Then

206
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,959
the next thing that I wanted to do was

207
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,279
created uh was creating a basic

208
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,920
visualizations.

209
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,800
So here we got two charts showing kind

210
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:53,440
of this information. This first one

211
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:57,760
shows the daily closing price uh for the

212
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Gamestock starting here at August 2020

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,240
and ends the

214
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,279
28th of October, sorry, the 28th of

215
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,839
February of 2021. So it's kind of a a

216
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,800
sevenmon period

217
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:19,120
where we can see the incredible increase

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:24,079
in price that the Gamestock

219
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,560
uh that Gamestock had. It's important to

220
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,240
note that this

221
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,399
chart the yaxis is on a logarithmic

222
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,920
scale not on a regular scale. built on a

223
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,160
logarithmic scale to show the massive

224
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,399
price changes. Here we can see in August

225
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,240
how it's pretty low around uh one to $5

226
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,320
but but slowly trending upwards.

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,880
Then in December

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,680
uh momentum builds but it's not crazy

229
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,600
yet. And then here we can see of course

230
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,480
uh in January 2021 the stock explodes

231
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,920
vertically which shows the squeeze. And

232
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,399
then in February 2021, it collapses back

233
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,880
down as we can see right here, but it

234
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,519
stays way above the old levels.

235
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
Um, and this matters because this chart

236
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,480
is kind of the backbone for the entire

237
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,040
EMA analysis. It shows that there's a

238
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,000
huge deviation from normal prices, a

239
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
price move that cannot be explained by

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,279
fundamentals or public information

241
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,000
alone. and it shows the exact moment

242
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,360
where retail behavior plus the short

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,560
squeeze mechanics took over. So it's the

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,560
point where the semi- strong EMH breaks

245
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,760
down.

246
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Um then we have this following chart

247
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,600
which is a GameStock daily trading

248
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,959
volume. The trading volume is how many

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,760
stocks how much stocks were traded in

250
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,320
that single day. So here we can see the

251
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,600
red dotted line at the bottom uh shows

252
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,200
the average trading volume before 2021

253
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,440
which was around 43 million just above

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:13,279
43 million stocks each day. Uh which

255
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:17,600
honestly really really surprised me. I

256
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:21,040
did not expect that that many that that

257
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,320
amount of stocks was being traded even

258
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,440
when Gamestock was at its lowest like it

259
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,160
it really really surprised me to see

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,360
that huge number

261
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,839
and we can see how uh from August to

262
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,920
December it's the volume is low and

263
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:43,200
steady has a few spikes in uh in in

264
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,399
October but then steadies out again. But

265
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,000
then in January 2021, the volume

266
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,839
explodes massively

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,240
to a point where some days reach six to

268
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,079
almost 800

269
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,720
million shares traded on a single day.

270
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,680
So there's a retail frenzy plus the

271
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,839
short covering period. And this chart

272
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,000
here is our evidence for the other side

273
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,920
for the herd behavior for uh fear of

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,399
missing out and social mediadriven

275
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
buying as well as market stress. And

276
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
here shows the 10-fold increase in

277
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
volume which was stated in the

278
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,079
assignment and we went over in our

279
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,199
driver document.

280
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,199
This tells us that rational

281
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,279
like like this wasn't rational

282
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,600
information processing. It was a crowd

283
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,920
event which supports the case for

284
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,279
behavioral explanations

285
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,800
and shows the limits to arbitrage

286
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,440
showing once again that EMH breaks down

287
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,560
here. These two charts they show the

288
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,240
full structure of the GME squeeze a slow

289
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,880
small trend uh early on then an

290
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,600
explosive price jump in January 2021.

291
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,120
And this behavior doesn't align with uh

292
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,519
efficient market uh idea that prices

293
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
reflect information efficiently.

294
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
Instead, the combination of extreme

295
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,199
volume and vertical price right here

296
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,279
movement suggests that a behavioral

297
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,040
event amplified by short squeeze

298
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:26,000
mechanics, not fundamentals.

299
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Uh and then we got the uh daily returns

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,079
and abnormal days.

301
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,639
Okay. So, here we have the the daily the

302
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,440
top 10 positive daily returns where

303
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:44,000
there were abnormal gains. Here stands

304
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:48,000
out the 27th of January was the peak

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,160
peak day of of of

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,920
GameStock. The closing price was 86%

307
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,600
and there was a 134%

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,079
jump

309
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
from the previous day like something

310
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,920
crazy. Then we can see some other days

311
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,680
in January 103.9%

312
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,040
92.7%

313
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:15,279
67 uh 51% everything. And here we can

314
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,160
see that almost all of the top positive

315
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,880
days are during the short squeeze window

316
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,120
in a very tight cluster around late

317
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,360
January, which is of course what you'd

318
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,440
expect from a short squeeze. Forced

319
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,800
buying by hedge funds, retail investors

320
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,000
piling in, and halted trainings reopened

321
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,560
at higher prices.

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
This obviously is abnormal by any

323
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,360
standard.

324
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,240
EMH says that prices should adjust to

325
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,759
information gradually and rationally and

326
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,759
a stock doubling and or and even more

327
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,360
than doubling in one single day is by no

328
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,959
means a rational price discovery. It's a

329
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,240
behavioral frenzy which is evidence that

330
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,360
EMH is breaking down here. And then

331
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,360
right below we have the top 10 negative

332
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,720
daily returns where there were abnormal

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,400
losses. Uh we have some days like the

334
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,280
2nd of February uh there was a negative

335
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,839
60%. Uh the 28th of January which was a

336
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,439
negative 44% we have negative 42

337
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,960
negative 30%. So it's the same things as

338
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,960
before. The worst crash days are right

339
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,160
after the biggest spikes which shows the

340
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,880
kind of to put it in an analogy the air

341
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:46,320
coming out of the bubble as fast as it

342
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:50,480
as it went in. So for example uh we have

343
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,360
138% one day then negative60%

344
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
the next day and this volatility tells

345
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,679
us that prices weren't driven by

346
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,880
fundamentals and the market wasn't

347
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,960
processing information normally. It was

348
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,640
uh force leveraging was happening.

349
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,080
Um, so here these tables show the most

350
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,840
extreme daily returns. The biggest days,

351
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
the biggest gains and losses happened

352
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
within the squeeze windows. And these

353
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,039
swings are far outside the normal market

354
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,760
behavior. They're not explainable by

355
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,080
fundamentals nor public news, which

356
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,679
supports once again the argument that

357
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:34,000
GME temporarily broke down semi strong

358
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:38,400
EMA and was driven by behavioral forces.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,960
a and short squeeze mechanisms

360
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,720
and then we have these uh eventbased

361
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,840
analysis uh part of the EMH discussion.

362
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,520
So here we're comparing uh two key

363
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,400
events which is the Ryan Cohen uh when

364
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,840
Ryan Cohen bought 13%

365
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,480
uh taking in the company which was the

366
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:08,799
21st of September in 2020 and uh the

367
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,000
short squeeze peak which was the 27th of

368
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,559
January of 2021. And here I wanted to

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,880
calculate the average return five days

370
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,200
before these events and the average

371
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,640
returns five days after the event.

372
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,160
What the results show is that for the

373
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,360
Ryan Cohen event 5 days the average

374
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,919
return 5 days before the event was

375
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,240
positive 9.48%

376
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,200
and 5 days after was 3.42%.

377
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,080
So here we know that the runup before

378
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,559
the news is bigger than the runup after.

379
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,400
This could indicate speculation,

380
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,720
rumor or circulation. But I mean at the

381
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,320
end of the day it's more normal because

382
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,280
it's 9% 3% it could represent something

383
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,440
but it's more normal compared to the

384
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,720
second event that we're uh comparing it

385
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,320
to which is the short squeeze peak. the

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,320
the average return 5 days before was

387
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
34.26%.

388
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,600
And the average return 5 days after was

389
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,840
-2.90%.

390
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,039
So this is kind of a sensitivity

391
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,600
analysis that we're doing were the five

392
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,159
days before the peak were insane.

393
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,679
Everything overheated and the five days

394
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,919
after show a crash. So the squeak

395
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,280
unwound

396
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:41,039
uh this pattern of course is absolutely

397
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,559
incompatible with EMH. A 34% average

398
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:49,360
runup before the peak followed by a 13%

399
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:52,559
crash after is screaming herd behavior

400
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,000
forced buying panic selling and market

401
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:00,320
instability which is the perfect tie-in

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,440
for our EMA discussion.

403
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,400
Um uh here we know that this table shows

404
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,720
is on.

405
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,960
Then uh I wanted to include a benchmark

406
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,240
comparison between the Gamestock

407
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:23,360
stock. Wait, what? The Yeah. Yeah. The

408
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:27,679
GME stock, the GameStop stock. Kind of a

409
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:32,400
word play there. the game GameStop stock

410
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:36,240
versus the S&P 500. So basically the

411
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:40,400
market. So what here I wanted to

412
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,679
download the S&P 500 and compare its buy

413
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,280
and hold returns to the GameStop

414
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,760
GameStop.

415
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,000
And here it is absolutely insane what we

416
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,640
can see from this information. The

417
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:03,919
period is from uh the 1st of the 1st of

418
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:06,320
August in 2020 to the 28th of February

419
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,799
2021.

420
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
And here we can see of course here what

421
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,799
we're taking into account is if we

422
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:19,919
bought on the 1st of August of 20 and we

423
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,679
sold 28th of February 2021.

424
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,760
This crazy

425
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:30,200
spy total return in this in this moment

426
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,200
would be is of 16.64%.

427
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,440
While the GameStop return

428
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,440
on this period is

429
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
2,351.57%.

430
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,360
So a stock with

431
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,000
2300%

432
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,280
return in seven months is absolutely

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,280
crazy, abnormal and unsustainable. It

434
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,039
does not reflect fundamentals, does not

435
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,520
align with EMH and cannot be predicted

436
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,000
systematically.

437
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,559
So the key concept here is that the

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,520
rational versus the speculative profit.

439
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,840
A rational investor uses public publicly

440
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,720
available information, does not rely on

441
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,120
perfect timing, and looks for repeatable

442
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,159
systematic return opportunities. While a

443
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,480
speculative investor gamles on timing,

444
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,720
benefits from luck, hype, or extreme

445
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,559
volatility and does not have a

446
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
consistent strategy that they can

447
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,600
repeat.

4",,,
8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME's returns fall directly into the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second category.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then for the final part of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis, I wanted I wanted to include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some simple trading strategy analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some uh so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a simple buy and hold is the strategy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So comparing two strategies, strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one is a simple buy and hold where you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy the 3rd of August in 2020 at a price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of $1.04.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04 and you sell at February 26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at a price of $25.43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here you have a total return of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$2 ,351.57%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is what we just said earlier. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the second strategy which is from the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cohen news to the squeeze peak. So if,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you were to have bought the 22nd of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
September. So just one day after the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:45,279 --> 00:24:55,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cohen news at 2.64% 64%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:48,880 --> 00:24:57,520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and he sold at the peak of the of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
squeeze at the squeeze peak I mean not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intraday uh peak because that I mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's important to clarify and probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have said this earlier but the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intraday squeeze but like the intraday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are not the same as the closing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices the intraday prices can go much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
higher or much lower for example we know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that in the squeeze speak the intraday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices went up to over $400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which then settled down for the a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
closing price of $86.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is the closing high. Uh but still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the closing prices are the ones that are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
485,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best used for the uh efficient market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis calculations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:38,720 --> 00:25:46,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay. Uh for the second strategy the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return would be 3,190.81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81%. This strategy shows that the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns are these returns are hindsight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
491,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect. Like no rational investor would,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
know how to buy on exactly these dates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or sell exactly at the peak. Strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two is literally impossible to execute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reliably because no one can time a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
squeak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So here we can uh here this section we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can have the evidence and of course with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all we've said needed to answer the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assignment question could a rational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:19,520 --> 00:26:27,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
investor had profited systematically and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer is definitively no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:27,279 --> 00:26:35,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they could only profit through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speculation luck or unrealistic timing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,799,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these strategies shows that there there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is a great difference between investment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,799,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and speculation which is the point that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:43,279 --> 00:26:51,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're trying to get here from these out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outputs. Weak form of EMH absolutely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
destroys past price patterns would not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
predict these movements. No chance. Semi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strong EMH absolutely destroyed. Public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information alone cannot justify 35%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average returns before the peak and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
negative% negative 13% after the peak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is what we saw uh right here in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the in the eventbased analysis. and two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to 3,000 buy and hold games and event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volatility that cannot be explained and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",False,1,Hi", my name is Aaron Grohovski and in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this video I'll be walking through my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
session 8 project on market efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and behavioral finance. The objective of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this assignment is to investigate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether the GameStop short squeeze in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
early 2021 is consistent with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient market hypothesis or whether,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it represents a breakdown caused by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavioral forces. This was done using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Python and following the driver format.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first step is to define our issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um so the first step I wanted to verify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the common statement that GameStop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
traded at 4 cents in August 2020. Second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to analyze whether the massive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price movements around this represents a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
violation of EMH uh especially the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
semi-rong form. Third I asked whether a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rational investor could have exploited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this alleged mispricing while accounting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for risk and real world trading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frictions. And finally I wanted to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understand the role of behavioral biases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and limits to arbitrage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, I pull GME and S&P 500 prices using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my finance. Here on the screen, you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see um the August 2020 data. Minimum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pricing at $104 and the maximum at $167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um this immediately tells us that the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim about GameStop being 4 cents was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inaccurate. Prices were very low, but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not literally pennies. not 4 cents. As I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
said, minimum was A$104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um, the next step was a represent is the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
represent stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um, where I designed the structure of my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event body. I selected January 27th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021 as my event date because this was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
close to the peak of the initial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
squeeze. Then I created two windows. an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation window from August 4th to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
December 28th, 2020 of about 102 days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and an event window from January 12th to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
February 10th,2021, which is 21 trading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During the estimation window, I modeled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a normal GME returns using a simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
market model. Return is equal to alpha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plus beta multiplied by the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return. Under semi-strong efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once information is public, GME's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns shouldn't systematically deviate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from these expected values. And you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see all of that being implemented here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the Python code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The next step is to implement this. In,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the implementation stage, I go to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
full event study. And you can see all of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that being done here. All of this is my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
implement stage where I code all of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
events, where I code everything needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where I create my plots, everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And what this does is it allows us to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model it. So first I computed daily log,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns for both GME and the S&P 500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using the estimation window I performed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Using the estimation window I performed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a regression to estimate alpha and beta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and those results were u 0.01376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per day and 1.73 for a beta value which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
created an R squar of 0.059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the market explains only about 6% of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GMA's typical return variation which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
already hints that GME behaves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
differently from a normal large cap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we can see that from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here where we have our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc table. So with the alpha and beta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimated, I then calculate the abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns. Actual minus actual minus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expected and accumulative abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns over the event window. You can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see several large positive abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns as we approach the squeeze date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which can be seen here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The next step is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bar charts. So the first plot shows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daily abnormal returns. The spikes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
illustrate how volatile and unpredicted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the returns were relative to the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model. And we can see that here. There's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of abnormal returns, especially,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
focused around the event date and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fall off that occurred afterwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um, the next one is the car plot and it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tells an even more clear story. The,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cumulative abnormal returns rise sharply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and peak just under 3.0 0 around the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event date showing a massive temporary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outperformance relative to fundamental,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
relative to fundamentals but afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C falls back down and finishes near 0.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the end of the event window. This,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rise and fall pattern is a classic short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
squeeze behavior and this can be seen on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chart. Massive increase leading up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to that date stays a little bit higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around than as as expected and a huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
falloff that matches the previous time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um the next plot I created is the volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plot. Now in addition to returns I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
examined volume. You can see here that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the normal volume is tens of millions of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shares.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um but during the squeeze it spikes up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to hundreds of millions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um this reflects extreme trading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pressures from both retail buyers and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short sellers covering their positions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh the next plot I created was the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rolling volatility and here you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 20-day rolling volatility that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spreads across our time frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um volat our 20-day being here and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volatility jumps from singledigit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
percentages to nearly 40% of daily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volatility. And you can see that massive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jump right here and the middle of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being our date that we're focusing on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an extraordinary high jump for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any stock and this reflects enormous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disagreement about fair value and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme risk for anyone trying to trade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um, and the next step is for us to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
validate everything that we've just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen. And we use this area where we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a t a test statistic output. So what I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did was I evaluated the statistical econ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
significance of the results and we got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the average abnormal return across,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the event window is around 0.0288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the t statistic is only about 0303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which you can see right here. This,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
creates a p value of 0.76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0.7649.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That means the average abnormal return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over the full 21-day window is not stat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
statistically significant as our p value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is greater than our significance level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of 5%. So 0.7649 is greater than 0.05 is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how we're evaluating this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um and that means that the total car for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the window is 0.6045 6045 or about 60%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60 percentage points of cumulative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outperformance. But again, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volatility is so high that the results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lack statistical significance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economically, this does not imply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arbitrage. Short sellers faced unlimited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
losses, borrow fees, margin calls, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outright trading restrictions. Long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buyers face the risk of buying into a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bubble that could collapse instantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we can see that that collapse did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
occur for anyone that did try to act as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long buyers. So even though the event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks inefficient, it was not as easily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exploitable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in inefficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um the next step is the evolve where we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think about how this can be applied. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop shows that markets are not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always perfectly efficient, especially,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in small caps with high short interest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and short social media narratives. But,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also shows that exploiting these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inefficiencies requires timing, luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and tolerance for extreme risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there's a very balanced takeaway to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from this. Lean passive should be the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goal for your for most of your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
portfolio. However, you should consider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a small active sleeve for special,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
situations while respecting the risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risks involved. So, you should keep the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
large percentage of portfolio to be safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
passive income, but you can set aside a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small amount to be for the high higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk active stocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to wrap up, um, my conclusions blend EMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with financial behavior. On one hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop's behavior clearly violates the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strictest versions of EMH. The extreme C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spike, massive volume, and huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volatility are driven more by psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
than fundamentals. On the other hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact that the overall event window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shows no statistically significant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal return combined with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme risk and trading friction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suggests that exploiting these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inefficiencies is extremely difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So my final view is that markets are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adaptively efficient. They are usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient but they can be they can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temporarily break down when behavioral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forces overwhelm fundamentals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello, my name is Riley Gross and today
0:04
I will be talking about market
0:05
efficiency and behavioral finance.
0:08
Specifically, we will be looking at the
0:10
GameStop uh short squeeze in 2020 2021.
0:15
Um so going straight into that, we have
0:19
our um assignment right here. So, um,
0:22
for anyone that doesn't know, um, in
0:26
2021, um, 2020, 2021, um, people on a
0:31
Reddit or subreddit called Wall Street
0:33
Bets tried or figured out that they
0:36
could mess with the GameStock price. Um,
0:39
so ultimate ultimately a bunch of them
0:42
invested in GameStop and it started
0:44
rising and GameStop was trading very
0:46
very low. it was um the market
0:49
volatility was almost at one um and it
0:52
it wasn't really having much returns.
0:54
Wasn't a great stock to be invested in.
0:57
Um but that's kind of the point of today
0:59
is that how markets can shift by
1:02
people's behavior.
1:04
So first off, I will be utilizing the
1:06
driver framework um to go along with
1:09
this and I will also be utilizing Python
1:13
um which we will get to in a second. But
1:15
first, I used Gemini, put my prompt in
1:17
to get the Python code. Um, and then I
1:20
said, you know, I'm a finance studying
1:22
this specific market efficiency and
1:24
behavioral finance. I'm looking to make
1:26
a video and I want you to make me a
1:28
Python script that would allow me to
1:30
better understand this case study of
1:32
GameStop and the short squeeze that
1:34
happened. Um, so next thing, um, going
1:38
to this. So, the first kind of problem
1:41
um we were given was that it said
1:43
GameStop was trading at 4 cents in
1:47
August of 2020. Now, just looking up the
1:51
um GameStop price in August 31st of
1:55
2020, we can in all of August, we can
1:57
see it was trading about a dollar. Um
1:59
you can see it was um going up some
2:01
every day at open of the market um and
2:05
closing at a higher price pretty much or
2:07
for the most part especially towards the
2:08
end of the month. Um so kind of the
2:10
start of this these people on the
2:13
subreddit um influencing the market some
2:16
when you you know when you get enough
2:18
people um to factor into it. Um so the
2:23
next thing um that I will go over is
2:26
kind of our second stage. which we
2:27
already went over the define the
2:28
problem. Um then the the answer to this
2:33
one um the the inaccurate data would be
2:36
look look up the data. You know um we
2:38
clearly saw the opening price and
2:41
closing price and anything in between um
2:43
of that GameStop data. It was around a
2:45
dollar to I would say a dollar um 50 in
2:49
um August of 2020. So a way to correct
2:52
that would be you know show them the
2:53
actual financial data to your professor.
2:55
um that way they can kind of understand
2:57
that.
2:58
And then just more uh I already talked
3:01
about this um but the Wall Street bets
3:03
they they made the price surge all the
3:06
way up to $483.
3:08
And then this was ultimately market
3:10
manipulation but you know it it shows
3:14
how people um can affect these markets.
3:17
Um so uh moving on to our um our
3:23
represent stage. Um we're going to be uh
3:27
going over our Python code. So I
3:29
imported pandas, numpy, mapplot, lib, um
3:32
stats to give us uh data for this and as
3:36
well as for the graphs to show to show
3:38
us some good visualizations of what
3:40
actually happened with the market and
3:42
how it was manipulated.
3:44
Um so we have um the split adjusted um
3:49
numerical here um at a dollar um for
3:53
August 2020.
3:56
And then um we have these ranges of
3:59
dates that it's giving us to help show
4:01
in the visualizations.
4:03
um and then giving us numbers um for our
4:08
specific um beta scores as well as the
4:11
uh stock price. That way we have some uh
4:15
some way to graph these um based off of
4:18
um historical data.
4:22
And then we're looking at our squeeze
4:24
returns right here. Um, and then the the
4:27
overall returns and what it was, um,
4:29
also based on historical data of the
4:32
GameStop stock price and how it
4:34
increased and then eventually flattened
4:36
out um, after they already kind of took
4:39
advantage of the market. Um, you know,
4:41
and some some people gain themselves a
4:44
lot of money. Um, and then here are the
4:46
prices calculating returns um, based on
4:49
the split adjusted price. Um and then
4:54
um
4:56
more series um data um for specific
5:01
dates.
5:03
And then we're also additionally
5:04
comparing this um to the S&P 500 um
5:08
which is the market itself essentially
5:11
and seeing how it was manipulated. Um
5:13
and then all of these are just graphs.
5:15
So going to the output
5:18
here, we already discussed that the
5:22
actual stock price was hovering
5:24
somewhere around a dollar $150 for
5:26
GameStop in August 2020. And then we
5:29
will be calculating um abnormal returns
5:33
um which is basically just the actual
5:35
return return minus the expected return.
5:37
Then we're going to sum all these up to
5:39
get our cumulative abnormal returns. And
5:42
our expected returns is just the um beta
5:46
um of GameStop times the return of the
5:49
S&P 500.
5:54
All right. And then uh
5:57
going to our first graph right here, we
5:59
have the squeeze. So the adjusted close
6:02
price of GameStop in 2020 was very very
6:07
low. And you can see down here, um, so
6:11
this is, uh, October, so it's it's
6:13
hovering around $4 at that point. Um,
6:15
and then it it's kind of staying steady
6:18
until about, uh, somewhere in January.
6:22
Then it starts to rise. Um, as well as
6:25
the volume of people buying Gamestock.
6:29
Uh, you can see it continually go up
6:32
right here. Um, it's adjusted closing
6:34
price. So um
6:39
this is all due to this subreddit buying
6:42
this stock and figuring out that they
6:44
could manipulate the market. You can see
6:46
here the volume um is very vast but in
6:50
uh between
6:53
uh or January and February. So scrolling
6:57
down a little more we're going to this
6:59
is what we just calculated or we're
7:00
talking about the abnormal returns. So
7:03
the cumulative abnormal returns the
7:05
actual minus the uh expected. So it
7:09
GameStop's hovering right around uh zero
7:11
which means that its actual returns was
7:15
very close to what it um the S&P was
7:19
basically predicting that its expected
7:21
returns were going to be. So it was
7:25
pretty um and based on spa score it was
7:29
um we can kind of um compute it almost
7:33
ourselves or estimate what it would have
7:34
been because it's hovering right around
7:36
this market uh price what it's actually
7:38
happened and what it was expected to but
7:41
in the middle of January like the other
7:43
graph we see a large rise in abnormal
7:46
returns
7:47
meaning that the actual return was much
7:51
higher than what it was expected to be
7:52
the market didn't understand this,
7:54
right? So, we actually had a peak in uh
7:57
January of 355%
8:01
um cumulative abnormal return. So, this
8:03
is all the days um combined in this um
8:08
timeline here. So, um yeah, right here
8:12
we even say the spike is proof of an
8:14
anomaly. We that line should be right
8:17
around zero or the market price.
8:20
So the next one is the beta score um
8:23
over time. So this one starts in January
8:27
2020
8:29
and compares it to January 2021. It had
8:32
a fairly um
8:34
uh moving with the market. Its beta
8:37
score was close to one kind of
8:39
fluctuating up and down but on an
8:40
average it was close to one. Um now it
8:45
you know spikes some in um
8:48
um June um but then it kind of goes back
8:52
to normal but you can see uh in in
8:55
January of 2021 it dropped drastically
8:58
point4 so it's moving against the market
9:02
um completely almost at a zero beta and
9:06
then um and then it spikes way high uh
9:11
super super volatile
9:13
Um, and that's because the market didn't
9:14
really realize what was happening. It
9:17
this isn't something this this squeeze,
9:19
especially at this level, um, isn't
9:22
something that happens a lot. Um, and
9:24
then you can kind of see it die down,
9:26
um, as the months go on further into
9:28
2021. Um, but the market wasn't
9:31
expecting this short.
9:33
So, while it had it had a normal beta of
9:35
1.07, 07. Um, and then this peak squeeze
9:39
right here um right in uh January
9:43
um was basically the the time that all
9:46
these people invested in the stock and
9:48
it completely messed up the company's or
9:51
the stock prices volatility. The market
9:54
um eventually adapted um but it didn't
9:58
exactly know what to do at that point.
10:01
So going back to um our driver
10:05
framework, we have now implemented, we
10:07
have validated, we looked at the um
10:11
implementation was the Python code um
10:15
and then the validation was these graphs
10:17
we just looked at and then the evolution
10:19
was looking a little further. Um, in
10:22
that last one, looking at the the beta
10:24
score, the how the systematic risk or
10:27
the the volatility um changed due to
10:31
this uh market anomaly in which people
10:34
um raised the stock price um in its
10:37
returns from only um about a dollar to
10:40
all the way up to you know 483.
10:44
Very very um large increase.
10:48
So moving on to the reflection stage.
10:55
In hindsight, um this analysis shows
10:58
that markets aren't perfectly efficient.
11:01
Um you can see that this is a great
11:04
example um of this because there was a
11:09
semi- strong form of the um efficient
11:12
market hypothesis. Um, but it was broken
11:16
due to this frenzy of people using
11:19
publicly available information buying up
11:22
this stock. Now, you might say, why
11:24
might these are just individuals, why
11:26
didn't maybe a a hedge fund um try and
11:29
short this stock the other way? And it's
11:31
because they couldn't. There was so much
11:35
chaos within the market and um such a
11:38
strong sense of hurting um with the
11:40
people that invested in the in GameStop
11:43
stock or GameStop stock um that they
11:47
couldn't end up shorting this the
11:49
opposite way to bring it back to market
11:51
price. They knew it was completely off,
11:53
but these people had manipulated the
11:55
market given public information.
11:59
Now, some things to ponder on now that
12:01
we understand went through this case,
12:03
went through the driver framework, is
12:05
that when there's publicly available
12:08
information and people utilizing um
12:12
things like that to um short the market.
12:17
Something to keep in mind is that is it
12:19
ethical? Should should you give this
12:22
information to others if you have
12:24
certain information? maybe not
12:26
necessarily insider information but
12:28
information that could help you um in
12:30
which it can also crash the market. So
12:35
the the main idea here
12:39
is that markets aren't just simple
12:43
values of of money. They're very
12:45
chaotic, complex. They're not perfect.
12:48
They also take into account human
12:50
behavior. As we can see here, many
12:52
people um or people working in a group
12:56
or a herd,
12:58
they can control a lot more um than you
13:00
think. And it it it shows that
13:03
kind of like brings in risk into the
13:05
factor. That is why there is risk
13:07
because markets aren't perfect. If they
13:09
were, it would be easy to calculate and
13:11
everyone would be investing.
13:14
Thank you for listening today. I hope
13:15
you learned more about market efficiency
13:17
and behavioral finance.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Aba and this is my um section 8 assignment for the management 310 class. Um in this assignment I'll be analyzing the GameStop GME um short squeeze of 2020 2021 as a case study in market efficiency. So, the goal of this assignment is to verify whether the professor's statement, GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2022 and reached $483 by January 2021, is accurate and then use this event to test which forms of the efficient market hypothesis were violated. I'll also evaluate whether rational investors could have systematically profited from this event and whether behavioral finance provides a stronger explanation than the traditional EMH analysis. Um and then just as an overview um I used Google Collab and also um used a AI chatbot to ensure that my code was as efficient as possible and answered all the assignment questions correctly. And then I also implemented the driver framework of define, represent, implement, validate, evolve and reflect. Um so just to start off um I defined the scope in the hypothesis. So in the efficient market hypothesis, the EMH has three forms. There's a weak form where past prices and volumes cannot predict future returns. There's a semi- strong form where prices fully reflect all public information immediately. And then there's a strong form where even private or insider information is incorporated instantly. So my main objectives are to verify the price claims using real data, evaluate which forms of efficiency failed, test whether the abnormal returns exist existed and then link these results to behavioral explanations. Um and then I also just implemented I kind of represent the process visually. So the step one where I fact check um step two where I visualize step three where I model and then step four where I quant quantify. Um planning these stages is kind of just mapping out the driver framework um to make sure I'm designing my analysis before coding it. So initially I just started off by implementing all my different um Python libraries so that I could use it in my analysis. And then in this code block I went on to show how um this downloads daily open high low close volume data for both GameStop and the S&P 500 ETF which is just my market proxy. And then I kept unadjusted prices for factchecking and adjusted closes for returns. Um and that's just put over here. I also just have anything if the data download failed. um and then the daily returns from adjusted close as a percent change. From there, I defined a function called a month slice. And what this does is it isolates August 2022 and January 2021 data to verify the professor's numbers. And as a result, it shows that the August 2022 adjusted closes around $4 to5, not 4 cents. The January 2021 intraday high is $483, which is accurate. And the current price is around um uh oops, the current price is around $25, which is roughly correct. And I think the 4centent confusion arises because the postsplit adjusted prices scale historic values down by four times.

Um

to continue I made a section of the code where the we can show the plot of the GME's adjusted closing price since mid 2022. So looking down at this plot over here, the dashed vertical line over here, oops, it zoomed in. um shows that before September 2020 prices hovered around $4 to $5 and then um there's an upstick which follows kind of Ryan Cohen's um which could be the key event um 13% stake disclosure and then in late 2021 the price explodes from $20 to nearly $500 reflecting the Reddit possible Reddit driven short squeeze. Finally, such a discontinuity signals a semi- strong form efficiency breakdown. Prices did not just adjust smoothly to public information. Then we went on um to make a volume plot. This chart tracks trading volume. So at the squeeze peak volume searches 10fold validating reports of explosive retail activity. Economically volume spikes this large reveal hurting and attention bias which is behavioral not inforational forces. From there we made this OS regression estimates which shows the normal relationship between GME and the park. Um the formula used for it is R of GME equals A plus beta R of spy plus epsilon. The deviations um from this are expected are are expected return are abnormal returns ar by accumulating them through time we obtain car a key event study.

We go on to make a function called event window. What this does is it plots centers a plus or minus 10day window on an event and tracks the cumulative abnormal return. So if we considered the Cohen stake which happened in um 0901 2020 the car of it shows that during September 2022 cohen a small positive car leads to a modest efficient adjustment. Then in January 2021, the squeeze, the car rockets upwards um with the abnormal statistically significant P is equal to zero. And then in February of 2021, car trends negative. Um

this is the January 2021 squeeze. and then car turns negative showing correction once the frenzy subsided. These visuals demonstrate that the abnormal performance was both large and temporary. The t test is also shown below each graph to show that there was a statistical breakdown for each section. Um we also made a volume spike metric um function and what it does is numerically it shows the squeeze peak around 10 to 12 times higher volume than the prior 60-day average which quantifies retail dominance. Volume spikes this extreme reinforce that behavioral hurting are overwhelmed by fundamental trading.

And then in my validate section, I interpret um the results relative to the EMH and behavioral finance. So for the weak form, the past prices shouldn't predict future returns. The evidence of it was that there is no pre-event drift. So the verdict is that it holds. For the semi-rong, it means that public info priced instantly. So large significant AR and C at January 2021. with the evidence. This verdict shows that it was violated. Finally, for the strong form, the prediction is that even private info priced in um with the EV even private info is priced in. The evidence for this is that hed hedge funds are lost, which shows that constraints blocked arbitrage. The verdict is that it's violated in practice. Um the market behaved efficiently under normal conditions but failed under extreme social coordination. Rational traders could not exploit the mispricing. So Robin Hood's buying restrictions and extreme borrow costs and gap risk limited arbitrage. These are classic limits to arbitrage. In my evolve section, some future extensions that could deepen the study is using intraday data for microructure analysis, examining different option markets, integrating Reddit sentiment or Google trends as explanator explanatory variables, and applying multifactor models to separate risk versus behavioral drivers. So to conclude, let's reflect on what this assignment demonstrated. First, the statement that the GME traded at 4 cents in August 2022 was incorrect. Actual unadjusted prices were around $4 to5 with the discrepancy due to split adjusted data. The $483 high in January 2021 was actually correct and today's price near $25 is roughly accurate. The plots the plots and tests together reveal a pretty straight story. The adjusted close plot showed how prices stayed flat and then almost exploded almost overnight. A visuals marker to of a semi- strong inefficiency. The volume plot proved that this was a behavioral crowd event with trading activity increasing about 10fold. The car plots confirmed statistically significant abnormal returns concentrated around public highly discussed events. The t test quantified that those returns were not random noise but genuine short-term deviations from fair value. Finally, the volume spike metric provided a numerical link to a narrative retail narrative retail order flow overwhelmed professional liquidity. To summarize these findings, the weak form EMH held prices were not predictable from past data. The semi- strong EMH broke. Public information from Reddit and short interest was not efficiently priced in. Finally, strong form EMH failed in practice. Even informed hedge funds couldn't arbitrage mispricing due to constraint. Now, could rational investors profit systematically from this? I would say no. The combination of brokerage limits, capital constraints, and extreme volatality made any arbitrage opportunity unexploitable. This underscores that inefficiencies can exist without being tradable, which is a central insight of behavioral finance. Now, behaviorally, this event showcased hurting, FOMO, attention cascades, and social reinforcement. Traders were guided less by cash flow expectations and more by group identity and emotion. And even though the market eventually reverted towards fundamental value after the frenzy, GME stabilized between 20 and $30 within analysts fair range value fair r fair fair value range of $10 to $40. That rein version reinforces that EMH is not obsolete. It's just conditional. In the short run, markets can be socially irrational. In the long run, they are self-correcting. The GME episode doesn't prove disprove EMH but rather illuminates its boundaries. Market in efficiency depends on human behavior, information flow and structural frictions. When any of those break, efficient efficiency temporarily fails. Now from an analytical standpoint, this product project taught how empirical finance tool, data retrieval, regression modeling, event study methods can rigorously test financial theory. It also showed why complete understanding of markets must integrate both quantitative analysis and also behavioral insight.

Um in summary, the Gamestock the Gamestock um situation proved that markets are efficient until they aren't. Efficiency is not a binary state but a spectrum influenced by psychology, technology, and constraints. Understanding those instruct interactions is what turns financial theory into real world insight. Thank you.",,0,1

I'm Gavin Hannannah and today I am doing the session 8 assignment and this assignment is we are investigating a mark efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event that happened in 2020 2021. So we were giving uh fact some facts and our event timeline which our timeline was in August 2020 GameStop nearly went bankrupt. September in September Ryan Cohen acquires 30% state in January of 2021 Reddit drove prices up to $483. In February, congressional hearings on there was congressional hearings on market manipulation for GameStop. And with some key data points, short interest peaked at 140% of float. Retail trading volume increased 10folds during squeeze. Trading restrictions implemented at peak. Hedge fund Melbourne Capital sustained 53% loss requir requiring a bailout. And lastly, analysis fundamental value estimates were between $10 to $40 per share. So for define and discover, our objective is to analyze the game stop event against the pred predictions of the efficient market hypothesis. And we need to evaluate whether this market anomaly constitutes evidence against market efficiency or if it be it can be explained within existing financial frameworks such as behavioral finance. So, first we need to verify the um facts that we're giving. So, the first one was GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020. And to determine if this is factually correct or not, I used Yahoo Finance and I came up with that the lowest that GameStop traded at was around a dollar. The highest was $1.79 and on average was around $1.17. So based on what I found, this the GameStop did not trade at 4 cents in August 2020. So that statement was incorrect. And so I would need to communicate this to professor and I would probably send out an email explaining the incorrect statement and showing him the real data that I gathered. So, next we have the other facts of Janu January 2021. Reddit uh drove prices up to $483. Uh short interest peaked at 140% of float and trading restrictions implemented at peak and I was able to verify the rest of these facts. So, these were all correct. So now that we have all all the correct facts in the event, we go to the represent stage. And this is where we're going to determine which of the efficient market hypothesis form was violated. So there's three of them. Weak form, which is prices reflect all past trading data. This form was violated due to the sudden massive nonf fundamental price change that happened and it suggested a market driven by past buying selling pressure rather than rational the rational pricing. The next form was semi- strong form and this prices these prices reflect all publicly available information. So like financial statements, news and analyst reports and I found that this form was actually the most violated. The peak price was several times higher than any reasonable fundamental estimate suggesting a massive disconnect from publicly available uh value information. Like how this means that like I said that $483 it was priced at at one time. Realistically analysts found that it was actually valued at $10 to $40 instead of $483. And then last is the strong form. This is when prices reflect all information public and private. This was likely not tested due to it being hard to prove because due to um information being private. So next we are going to implement and to we're going to determine um market analyst constitute evidence against market efficiency. And so with my code I did into different uh stages of discover. And in step one, I had it check the fact that um the claim of it was um GameStop was priced at 4 cents was incorrect as it found that the lowest in August was around 1.04 and the highest was around 1.67. So it used an if statement that claimed if it if these amounts were greater than if the lowest amount was greater than point4 uh.5 or point4 then this the statement would be incorrect and as shown here it the code uh correctly verified that the claim is incorrect and is significantly higher than 4 cents. Next was the represent stage. And in this stage is where I had it claim which um H uh HM H or EMH was form was violated and it used all the information that I gave it that was I was given and it correctly came up with that the event primarily challenged the semi- strong form of EMH and it stated the reasons for this and it was that semi strong states that prices reflect all public information and like I said that the stock surged to $483 when it actually costed around $10 to $40.

And so now we are going to the implement stage and this is where we um actually see if mark an anomalies was the reason behind um this the this event and so with stage step three and four is implement validate. So in this stage it's going to first um split data into the estimation and event windows and then it's going to which is going to calculate the adjust returns for the risk-free rate using this formula and then next it's going to calculate the abnormal return calculations using the CAPM framework uh estimation. It's going to estimate alpha and beta to come up with its um uh de data. And then with the uh stage four, which was the validate stage, this is when it's going to use the t test to use the null hypothesis that the abnormal rate is equal to zero. and or if it doesn't equal zero. So it's going to use the t test and then calculate the p value and the mean abnormal daily normal return. And here we can see that the implement did just that the stage did just that that around 2020 to 2021 um it calculated a alpha around.12 and a beta of.0505 0505 and it calculated and it using uh the website that I had the Yahoo Finance it came and found out that there were some abnormal returns a very high abnormal returns around January 25th and February 1st it had a high a noral return of 1.75 and a high of 1.5 on February 1st. And which makes sense cuz that was when Reddit around January, Reddit uh called the prices to go up and this was around February was around uh when there was congressional hearings. So it makes sense that they were high around that the that time period. And to validate we're going to use the uh collab used a statistical significance testing and it calculated test statistic of 1.77 p value of 0.085 085 and a mean daily abnormal rate of 0.11 and it calculated a total cumulative abnormal return of 4.51 and using this this data it was able to conclude to do not reject the null hypothesis that the no return was equal to zero.

So what this tells us is that the reason so the reason we calculate this abnormal return is to test if GameStop event was a real unique market anomaly. And this tells us that it was we reject that that statement. And so next I have is a visualization showing the cumulative annual returns to showcase that around 2021 in January and February that that is when the p the normal returns mostly increased by mostly increased by. So next we want to evaluate so whether there were even profit opportunities for uh GameStop investors. For the most point no there were not in the EMH sense because a rational investor following a strategy of buy low sell high based on fundamental value would have been on the short side and incurred devastating losses because they bought at such high prices of $483. when the uh price was actually around $10 to $40. Now there are there was opportunity for some in the behavioral behavioral sense. Those profitable investors were those who identified that these were extreme an anomaly and they bet on the behavioral catalyst.

So now we want to go to the evolve stage and this is where we're going to uh talk about this where I'm going to talk about how there there were different factors for this uh GameStop event. So first is how quickly and accurate market reflect new information. how Reddit uh started uh putting in that to invest in the company and how that new information affected uh first the accuracy which was the market was highly inaccurate cuz like I said earlier 10 it was actually $10 to $40 and not $483 and next was speed. The market was extremely fast to incorporate technical and social mediadriven information. The news of high short interest and coordinated buying triggered an almost instant massive price spike. So next I'm going to talk about behavioral biases and this is where how what caused people to invest in this um event. So first is hurting and bandwagon effect and this shows that the thousands of retail investors. This is when the investors followed uh the consens consensus based on the platform of like Reddit and this people bought the stock simply because everyone else was. Next is availability horistic and this is when the GameStop dominated the news and social media making it highly available in everyone's mind. Everyone wanted to invest in it which caused the stocks to rise much further. Next is overconfidence. Many individual traders believe they could time the market perfectly. However, buying just before the peak and selling right at top and they did this despite of the extreme risk. And lastly was loss aversion. This bias was particularly strong for the short selling hedge funds. Their loss aversion made them desperately cling to their short positions or try to cover them at any cost which fueled and increased the this squeeze event. So next I want to talk about market an anomalies. So this event itself c was categorized as a dramatic short squeeze anomaly which is a situation where technical factors for short sellers to buy causing the price to increase by a good amount regardless of like fundamental uh values and values people have. So how does this affect certain stuff? So for momentum, the price going up caused more people to buy and this caused the price to go up even more. This created a self-fulfilling prophecy of rising prices until the short interest was resolved. Now, how did this affect the value? Obviously, GameStop was much more overvalued even and its price climbed even more dramatically showing that for a period value fundamentals did not even matter to some people and investors. Next we're going to talk about asset substitution problem. This is a concept usually applied to highly leveraged firms but we can see a simplified version in this event like so for instance the hedge funds that shortened GameStop were highly leveraged which means they borrowed a lot of money to make a big bet. So, and when the shot stock price began to rise dramatically against their bet, these funds were facing massive immediate losses. When a highly leveraged entity is already losing, it might be incentivized to take even bigger risk. And this would to try and make up the deficit knowing that if the risk pays off, they win big and if it fails, they simply lose everything that they invested in. Next I want to talk about limits to arbit arbitrrage and this is arbitrageers are rational actors who try to correct mispricing by buying low and selling high. In this case the stock was clearly overvalued yet there was still inefficiency and this was due to nose trader risk. The nose traders which are the retail buyers acted irrationally and drove the price up to impossible levels. And next would be the implementation cost. This the incredibly high short interest of 140% meant they were physically not enough shares available to even borrow making the short selling strategy impossible to execute efficiently even at the peak. So with all that I want to reflect what I'm going to do. I want to uh compare em EMH versus behavioral finance. So with EMH investors are rational and prices reflect fundamental value whereas behavioral finance investors are human and they're more biased and prices can diverge from value. With the with this event, we can say that for EMH, the price was irrational, but the crash was the market eventually correcting the overvaluation. Whereas behavioral finance would state that the price was a behavioral bubble driven by uh hurting and sentiment triggered by a market micro structure vulnerability. And lastly, the implication for each in EMH. The this event highlighted that the semi-strong EMH only holds under normal conditions and fails catastrophically when market friction is extreme. Whereas in behavioral finance for the implication is that behavioral factors and coordination tools like social media can lead to sustained large scale price deviations like how um Reddit did. Next I want to talk about market efficiency policy implications and how this affected um how we should go about after this event. So want first of all we want the possibility of short interest exceeding 100%. We need to regularly review that like in this event it was up to 140%. From now on, we should probably review stuff like this when it reaches a minimum of a a maximum of 100%. Next is the clearing of settlement. So the clearing process constraint constraints that force brokerages like Robin Hood to halt buying must be more modernized to prevent such a systematic friction. And lastly, social media and market manipulation. regulars. We faced the challenge of distinguishing between collective investment enthusiasm and illegal market manipulation. The event uh underscored the need for regulatory mechanisms to adapt to the speed of modern retail coordination. And so all in all, I think the single most important thing that I learned is that markets are not are not always perfectly rational and people's feelings can sometimes matter more than math. So this event really taught me that successful financial an analysis requires combining the quant quantitative methods with an with also an understanding of human behavior.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"0:00:02.240,0:00:05.920
So for my session 8 assignment, we are 
looking at the efficient market hypothesis

0:00:05.920,0:00:11.680
um specifically with the GameStop situation. 
So first we have the first critical step of

0:00:11.680,0:00:22.560
um seeing the price of GameStop stock at 
in August 2020. Um and we can see here

0:00:22.560,0:00:28.480
um we're supposed to verify that trade at 4 
cents. Um, however, I pulled in from Yahoo Finance

0:00:28.480,0:00:36.800
um the stock price and it was actually um right 
here at $1.35. Um, so it was not at 4 cents. So,

0:00:36.800,0:00:43.920
just verifying that. Um, so first in my define 
and discover stage, I want to um look at all the

0:00:43.920,0:00:48.160
different parts of the efficient market hypothesis 
and relationship at GameStop. I want to look at

0:00:48.160,0:00:52.480
the behavior biases and market anomalies. And I 
also want to look at informationational advantages

0:00:52.480,0:00:57.760
really quick. Um so first you have sort of the 
weak portion of the efficient market hypothesis

0:00:57.760,0:01:04.960
um saying that um all past historical data is 
already kind of like set into the price. It's

0:01:04.960,0:01:11.200
basically already accounted for in the price of 
stock. Um and with this um there is no technical

0:01:11.200,0:01:15.520
analysis you can do um because everything's 
already accounted for. Um, and so it's kind

0:01:15.520,0:01:22.160
of like what they call a random walk um of this 
stock could go up, down, like we don't know. Um,

0:01:22.160,0:01:27.040
and there's nothing you can really do to change 
it. So obviously with the GameStop situation

0:01:27.040,0:01:34.000
um this was kind of like a failure um at this part 
because it wasn't a random walk, right? Like there

0:01:34.000,0:01:39.920
was a bunch of historical data and then all of a 
sudden um the stock dramatically changed. Um and

0:01:39.920,0:01:44.880
so obviously this was a failure. Um then there's 
the semi- strong. Um so basically you can't do

0:01:44.880,0:01:49.760
any technical or fundamental analysis. Um and 
this is basically saying that all information

0:01:49.760,0:01:56.160
or all public information um is already accounted 
for. So just interest rates and trading volume and

0:01:56.160,0:01:59.520
things like that that's already accounted for 
in the price. And so basically it's also kind

0:01:59.520,0:02:06.800
of this aspect of no free lunch um saying that 
you can't expect higher returns without higher

0:02:06.800,0:02:13.760
risk basically. Um and then finally there's the 
strong portion of this efficient mark hypothesis

0:02:13.760,0:02:18.000
um saying that not even insider training so 
basically saying that private information

0:02:18.000,0:02:22.800
um is actually already accounted for as well and 
so you can't even like inside trade and like try

0:02:22.800,0:02:31.120
to get ahead on something u because it's already 
accounted for. Um and so next talking about

0:02:31.120,0:02:34.960
the behavior biases specifically relates to the 
GameStop situation. So basically there was hurting

0:02:34.960,0:02:39.680
behavior and social media influence. Um, and I I 
kind of look at them sort of very intertwined. Um,

0:02:39.680,0:02:45.360
I think one was one caused the other. Um, 
basically hurting behavior. Everyone saw

0:02:45.360,0:02:50.080
the stock going up. Um, and sort of had the 
belief kind of from social media that everyone

0:02:50.080,0:02:54.720
was holding on to it. Kind of like the time with 
hands sort of reference. And so that everyone was

0:02:54.720,0:02:57.520
going to hold the stock and it was just going to 
go up up and up. And obviously that didn't happen.

0:02:57.520,0:03:03.040
It was squeezed and the stock came crashing down 
and a lot of people got burnt. Um, and then also

0:03:03.040,0:03:08.880
talking aboutformational advantages. Um, basically 
if you have anformational advantage in public

0:03:08.880,0:03:13.520
information, this contradicts the semi-strong 
portion because like semi-strong believes that

0:03:13.520,0:03:18.720
all public information has been accounted for. Um, 
and then if you have an private informationational

0:03:18.720,0:03:22.480
advantage that contradicts the strong portion 
because that's basically just like being able

0:03:22.480,0:03:28.560
to insider trade. And so basically this next step 
um I'm and I represent stage I want to show the

0:03:28.560,0:03:33.920
market return the stock return normal return and 
abnormal returns um from like kind of the time

0:03:33.920,0:03:42.000
period of the squeeze happening. Um and basically 
this is going to just show us like mathematically

0:03:42.000,0:03:49.360
how the efficient market hypothesis kind of broke 
down and how sort of um these like behavioral

0:03:49.360,0:03:55.920
biases and market anomalies sort of happened. And 
so basically, um, it pulled in all the prices and

0:03:55.920,0:04:01.360
everything from Yahoo Finance. It kind of used 
the CAPM model, um, to calculate everything. And

0:04:01.360,0:04:07.600
basically, if I just scroll all the way down here, 
um, you're going to see stock actual returns,

0:04:07.600,0:04:12.880
S&P market returns. So, they just pulled this 
in, no equations necessary. And then it used

0:04:12.880,0:04:21.520
expected returns um using the equation of well 
so the abnormal returns that is calculated from

0:04:21.520,0:04:29.200
actual returns minus expected returns um and then 
expected returns uses a another equation. It's

0:04:29.200,0:04:38.640
this one right here. Um it's that CAPM uh equation 
um using that beta. And so you can see here um

0:04:38.640,0:04:45.360
specifically with expected returns um looking at 
this past data right expected returns and abnormal

0:04:45.360,0:04:51.440
returns with the efficient mark hypothesis 
especially like that weak version should

0:04:51.440,0:04:56.320
pretty much be equal. There shouldn't be anything 
abnormal um because everything should already be

0:04:56.320,0:05:04.720
accounted for. But you can see here there are 
some crazy abnormal returns right 92% 170% like

0:05:06.000,0:05:10.720
137% like crazy crazy amounts. And so you can 
obviously see here like this was a breakdown

0:05:10.720,0:05:18.480
in the efficient market hypothesis and um this 
was a massive market anomaly and weird behavior

0:05:18.480,0:05:22.640
specifically like that hurting behavior I was 
talked about kind of generated these numbers.

0:05:22.640,0:05:30.320
Um so that's kind of like a mathematical way of 
looking at it. And then um going next into kind

0:05:30.320,0:05:34.480
of validate, I specifically kind of wanted 
to look at like predictability patterns and

0:05:34.480,0:05:46.880
systematic profit opportunities. Um and so I kind 
of used the prompt here. Um let me get to it.

0:05:46.880,0:05:54.080
Not that um

0:06:02.160,0:06:07.760
So, I kind of asked is there any specific like 
patterns or opportunities for this situation? Um,

0:06:07.760,0:06:16.080
and this basically said it was kind of predictable 
in that it used I'll go back here used sort of

0:06:16.080,0:06:20.640
high short interest as a signal. And so it was 
basically talking about how there was interest

0:06:20.640,0:06:27.600
over 100% of its already like of its stocks. And 
so um this allowed investors with high capital

0:06:27.600,0:06:35.600
allocation um and high risk tolerance to sort of 
short sell all this um and also the social media

0:06:35.600,0:06:44.560
as well. And then um there was systematic profit 
opportunities um and so like again sort of exante

0:06:44.560,0:06:49.360
um allowing investors with sufficient capital 
high risk tolerance to sort of create this short

0:06:49.360,0:06:55.120
squeeze and it actually became like a mathematical 
certainty um and like this was a bet on like just

0:06:55.120,0:06:59.520
pure market mechanisms and not the stock's 
fundamentals and that's going to we're kind of

0:06:59.520,0:07:05.360
get into that more later. Um, and then there's 
obviously the still the arbitrage limits. Um,

0:07:05.360,0:07:08.960
and that's there still isn't free lunch 
even though it seems like a certainty. Um,

0:07:08.960,0:07:14.720
and there's still extreme high risk and you can 
ask the people that bought probably when it was

0:07:14.720,0:07:19.280
going really really high and then kind of kept it 
and they got really badly burned um by the people

0:07:19.280,0:07:25.200
that just immediately sold. Um, and then going to 
evolve, I looked at two specific things I kind of

0:07:25.200,0:07:32.160
wanted to look more at. um talking specifically 
about the mark hypothesis versus sort of behavior

0:07:32.160,0:07:35.600
um plus market microstructure issues. And so 
this kind of bleeds into what I was talking

0:07:35.600,0:07:42.640
about earlier. Um and basically EMH is not 
perfect because it's assuming that all people

0:07:42.640,0:07:48.240
are rational perfectly rational investors which 
we're humans. We make states and so we're not.

0:07:48.240,0:07:54.960
Um and basically these two things of EMH and 
behavior financial analysis or BFA should kind

0:07:54.960,0:08:00.640
of be used together to explain markets. Um I think 
EMH should be used longterm and BFA should be used

0:08:00.640,0:08:06.240
short-term to kind of explain anomalies and weird 
behaviors and things like that. And then secondly,

0:08:06.240,0:08:10.240
market microructure issues. So obviously the 
market is not perfect and that's why this

0:08:10.240,0:08:14.560
thing like GameStop kind of happened. um sort 
of like I said before there was these short

0:08:14.560,0:08:19.040
interest over 100% of his available shares 
which kind of set the stage for a squeeze

0:08:19.040,0:08:25.280
um and all of this massive amounts of capital and 
everything um kind of intervened in the market's

0:08:25.280,0:08:31.680
price setting mechanism um yeah and then kind 
of reflecting kind of just talking about what

0:08:31.680,0:08:43.360
I learned so exante versus expost investing um 
basically exante is kind of looking at the past

0:08:43.360,0:08:48.400
um or looking before and making decisions. 
And then X post investing is kind of

0:08:48.400,0:09:01.760
um looking at the past to sort of set up 
like future models um for for for trading. Um

0:09:01.760,0:09:08.320
and then um also active versus passive management 
implications. Um when there's active management

0:09:08.320,0:09:13.200
implications, there's obviously going to be more 
risk involved. um and more market anomalies and

0:09:13.200,0:09:17.440
things like that where passive management 
implications. Um and this more agrees with

0:09:17.440,0:09:22.080
kind of the efficient market hypothesis of 
that you should kind of just stay back and

0:09:22.080,0:09:26.480
kind of don't touch it because it's impossible to 
time the market is kind of the the ground rule of

0:09:26.480,0:09:31.040
the efficient market hypothesis. Um and then 
also market efficiency policy implications. So

0:09:31.040,0:09:36.240
the biggest thing that kind of comes to mind is 
like insider trading laws. Um, so this is where

0:09:36.240,0:09:41.600
kind of the EMH is kind of strengthened because 
there's actually policies that are sort of you

0:09:41.600,0:09:47.920
can't use private information, you can't use sort 
of public information um to like get an advantage,

0:09:47.920,0:09:50.720
I guess. And so I thought that was really 
interesting that kind of strengthens kind

0:09:50.720,0:09:55.120
of the EMH like I said before. Um, so yeah, this 
is basically my session 8 assignment. Thank you.

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,490
Hello, my name is
Gavin Henning, and

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,330
today we're doing the
Session 6 Assignment

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,410
Market Efficiency
Investigation.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,870
So we're given
the overview to

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,630
investigate market
efficiency using

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,390
the GameStop GME
short squeeze event

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,110
of 2020 to 2021
as a case study.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,350
We have to
verify accuracy

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,690
of state of facts,

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,470
analyze price
behavior for

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,430
market hypothesis
predictions,

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,710
and evaluate whether
market anomalies

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,930
constitute evidence against
market efficiency or

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,990
can be explained with
existing frameworks.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,070
Critical first step
is to verify that the

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,430
GameStop traded at
four cents in August

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,510
of 2020 against actual
historical data.

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,290
I think correct document
the accurate figures

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,730
and determine
appropriate communication

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,410
approach for correcting
the professor so

21
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,610
it gives us event
timelines key data points

22
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,570
and the required
analysis so I did run

23
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,210
this in collab already
and it kind of pulls

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:14,890
historical data from
Yahoo Finance so maximum

25
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,550
trading price in August
2020 was a dollar

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,180
and I did run all
this in collab here's

27
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,110
kind of a visual but
also created a PowerPoint

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:52,570
to kind of in short
kind of recap these

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,710
findings so the GameStop
GME short squeeze

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,090
and analysis of market
efficiency and behavioral

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,190
finance um so the
four cents um was is

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,050
the question the trading
price is that fact

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,810
or fiction um so that's
really what we're

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,570
trying to discover
investigating claim that set

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,870
the stage for a market
anomaly um so key

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,110
questions answered uh
four cents in august in

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,410
2020 Was that a true
trading price? And the

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,170
answer is no. The
statement was incorrect.

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,910
The GME was
traded between $1

40
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,280
and $1.79 in
August of 2020.

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,370
Market efficiency
violated? Yes. The

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,430
weak form and the
semi-strong form

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,350
efficiencies were
potentially violated.

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,510
And was there
systematic profit?

45
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,110
Unlikely because
the event was

46
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,310
predictable, high
risk, and driven

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,190
by non-traditional
factors.

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,810
data analysis is what
what the numbers say

49
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,290
so key findings again
that a dollar was

50
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,570
actual minimum price
in August of 2020 not

51
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,410
four cents so the the
fact check is that

52
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,990
analysis directly
contradicts the viral claim

53
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,850
of a four cent trading
price the lowest

54
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,250
trading price for GME
in August 2020 was a

55
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,610
dollar with a max
trading price of $1.79.

56
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,990
This factual baseline
is critical for

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,190
understanding the scale
of subsequent squeeze.

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,450
So some key findings,

59
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,250
anatomy of the squeeze,
there's a $37.05

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,590
price increase from
January 25th to February

61
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,710
1st of 2021, a significant
and rapid price

62
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,110
surge 2.3 billion plus
shares were traded

63
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,570
so it's like
exceptionally high trading

64
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,470
volume during that
peak period and then 25

65
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,250
.91 standard deviation
so extreme volatility

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,410
in closing
prices and then

67
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,030
highlighting
market instability

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,050
some key findings a
weak form efficiency

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,730
violation historical data
historical data failed

70
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,130
to predict the surge
on the extreme and

71
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,510
rapid price surge was
not predictable based

72
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,890
on historical price
and volume data alone.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,270
Past performance is
not an indicator of

74
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,510
immediate future results
and this suggests

75
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,050
that a clear potential
violation of weak

76
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,570
form efficiency where
all past trading

77
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,890
data is supposedly
reflected in the current

78
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,130
price. And then
there's just a GME

79
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,330
price anomaly pre
-squeeze versus the peak.

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,050
So you can see at the
pre-squeeze how low

81
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,590
that price was And then
at the squeeze peak,

82
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,990
it skyrocketed to that
unpredictable surge.

83
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,230
For semi-strong
efficiency violation,

84
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,590
which was the
second one violated,

85
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,230
was irrational
response to public

86
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,890
information. So public
information, such as

87
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,010
social media posts or
short interest data,

88
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,590
did influence the
price. However, the

89
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,570
extreme market reaction
and volatility suggest

90
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,390
prices were not a
purely rational or

91
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,790
instantaneous reflection
of this information.

92
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,690
This indicates
potential violation

93
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,890
of a semi-strong
efficiency.

94
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,410
And this is just
kind of a visual

95
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,250
for that, that the
public information

96
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,270
such as social
media did directly

97
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,920
affect that market
price. behavioral

98
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,730

that confirm the squeeze

contradictory data and
then regret avoidance

",FALSE,1,"Hello, I'm Jose, and this is my video presentation for Section 6 assignment: Market Efficiency Investigating. I'll be analyzing the GameStop (GME) short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. My entire analysis follows the DRIVER framework as required, and I'll be demonstrating the Python code I used to conduct the financial analysis.

First, the Define and Discover stage. The primary objective is to investigate the efficiency of the stock market using the GameStop event. I used this to test GME's price behavior against the predictions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and evaluate whether this event can be explained by rational models or if it requires a behavioral finance framework.

A critical first step in this assignment was to verify a specific fact from the prompt. The stated fact was that GameStop traded at $0.04 cents in August 2020. As I demonstrated in the implication stage, my research immediately showed this statement to be incorrect. The actual split-adjusted low price in August 2020 was approximately $1.04. My analysis will therefore proceed using the correct, verified historical data.

My key research questions are: What was the actual verified price data for GME? Was Weak-form efficiency violated? Was Semi-strong form efficiency violated? How did the price react to public news like Ryan Cohen's investment or the Reddit posts? What behavioral biases, like herding, were evident?

Next, in the Represent stage, I planned my analytical approach to answer my research questions. I used Python for my analysis, using the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for visualization. I implemented this broken down into five steps. First, Fact Verification: Fetch the data for August 2020 to disprove the 4-cent claim. Second, Visualizations: Plot GME's price and volume and annotate key dates to get a visual sense of the event. Third, Volume Analysis: Quantify the ""10-fold increase"" claim mentioned in the prompt. Fourth, Weak-form EMH Test: Plot the autocorrelation of GME's returns. In an efficient market, this should be zero. Fifth, Semi-strong EMH Test: Run a simplified event study by calculating and plotting the Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) around the squeeze.

We now move to the Implement stage. I automated all the steps from the Represent stage in the Python script. I will run it now. Great, the script has finished. It printed its findings to the console and generated four image files. Let's review the output.

First, Output 1, Data & Fact Verification. As you can see, the console output confirms my finding from the Define stage. The actual lowest split-adjusted price for GME in August 2020 was $1.04, not $0.04. The prompt statement is definitely incorrect.

Next is Output 2, Price & Volume. Here is the chart. Here is our adjusted close price. It spikes up here. And then we go to our volume... the visual explosion in both price and, just as importantly, volume is undeniable.

Going back to the console for Output 3, the prompt claimed a ""10-fold increase"" in volume. My script calculated the average daily volume from September 2020 and compared it to the squeeze period. The result is an increase of 115.1 times. The 10-fold claim was a massive understatement, and this confirms the huge behavioral, herding-based interest in the stock.

For Output 4, the Weak-form EMH Test, the script generated two autocorrelation plots. On the left is the ""Normal Period."" All the bars are inside the blue shaded area, which means there is no statistical significance; the autocorrelation is effectively zero. This is what a weak-form efficient market looks like. But on the right, during the ""Squeeze Period,"" you can see multiple bars—especially at lag 1—are far outside the blue area. This shows strong positive autocorrelation, meaning a positive return one day was highly likely to be followed by another positive return. This is a clear-cut violation of weak-form market efficiency, driven by momentum and herding.

Finally, for Output 5, the Semi-strong Form, the script generated a GME Cumulative Abnormal Returns chart. In a semi-strong efficient market, all public information (like the Reddit short squeeze thesis) should be incorporated into the price almost instantly. If that were true, this line should have been flat after the squeeze began. Instead, the Cumulative Abnormal Returns soar upward for weeks. This severe violation demonstrates that investors who acted on publicly available information were able to earn significant, sustained abnormal returns.

Now, the Validate stage. The results from my implementation are conclusive. The visual evidence from the charts directly supports the quantitative findings. These findings are not just statistically significant; they are extreme. They align perfectly with all major financial journalism regarding the GME event. The data and conclusions are valid.

In the Evolve stage, I identified how this analysis could be made more robust. My test for abnormal returns was a simple market-adjusted model where I subtracted the S&P 500 return from GME's. A more advanced ""Evolved"" analysis would use the full Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This would involve using a stable estimation period, like 2019, to run a regression of GME's returns against the market's returns to find GME's Beta. Using that Beta, we would calculate the Expected Return during the squeeze. We would then calculate: Abnormal Return equals Actual Return minus Expected Return. This would give us a more academically rigorous measure of the abnormal returns, but I am confident it would lead to the same conclusion.

Finally, the Reflect stage. What did we learn? My analysis confirms that the GameStop event represents a significant, temporary breakdown of market efficiency. First, Weak-form EMH was violated: The strong autocorrelation provides evidence of momentum. Second, Semi-strong form EMH was severely violated: The fact that cumulative abnormal returns continued to rise for weeks after the short squeeze thesis became public is the most critical finding. It shows the market failed to incorporate public information instantly.

This event is a classic textbook case for behavioral finance. It demonstrates that ""Limits to Arbitrage"" are very real. Short sellers, who are supposed to be the ""rational actors"" correcting the price, were instead forced to complete a buyback, pushing the price even further from its fundamental value. The event was driven by behavioral biases like herding and overconfidence, all coordinated and amplified by the new technology of social media.

My reflection is that markets are mostly efficient, but they are not always efficient, and certainly not perfectly efficient. The GME event was a perfect storm where behavioral factors fueled by technology completely overwhelmed rational fundamental valuation. This concludes my driver analysis. Thank you for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, this is for the section six assignment looking at market efficiency. Um, and essentially we are investigating this market efficiency using GameStop um as this case study from 2020 to 2021. So essentially we need to verify the stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to the market predictions, evaluate um if the evidence is against the market efficiency or can be explained within these existing frameworks and then yeah so essentially we have a couple things we need to answer. So our first step would be to verify if the statement that GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020. Um if this is correct and we have some timeline here key data points required analysis with um the things we need to answer for the assignment. So go ahead and starting off with the driver framework. The our first task is to verify if the statement that GameStop traded at $0 um and 4 cents and August 20, 2020 was correct. And so for that was for the define stage the research so driver um using this historical data it shows that having the share price is very low and highly unlikely for a publicly traded stock. Um and this actually was incorrect. So the actual GME price in August of 2020 traded between $4 and $6.50 per share during that time frame. So our first step to go back to the assignment um this is not correct verifying that. So, a good way to kind of talk to the professor about this correction would be to address it clearly and politely. So, um you know, noticing a small discrepancy in the timeline, the price in August of 2020 was $4 to $6.50 and not um $04. So then again just kind of making that reassurance. So saying that it doesn't change the essence of the short squeeze case study but um but I did want to document this in discrepancy and showcase the actual figures that relate to that. For the second part of this assignment here for the required analysis testing which form of the market efficiency was violated. So determining for a defined stage with this particular question would be to determine which EMH um efficient market form was violated by the stock and by the price movement. So stating in our research stage that the squeeze was driven by the public sentiment on Reddit leading to a massive spike from $20 in early January to $483 at the peak um and then having the price exceeded um in this this statement. Interpreting this we will say that it for the weak form the price changes were based on public historical trading data. Um and the technical analysis shouldn't necessarily yield systematic profits. Um and then the initial rise was not purely based off of the past price action. And for the semi- strong form the price reflects all of the public information. So, financial reports, news, um, analysis reports, all of that. And the peak price was $483, which vastly ignored the publicly available fundamental value of $10 to $40. So, this would be a violation of this one before. For the weak form, it was unclear if it was necessarily violating it, but the semi- strong format is um due to the fact that the publicly available um information was ignored. And then the strong form. So price reflects all information public plus private slash insider sector and stating that no one not even the insiders could trade um could profit systematically and this would be in violation of this um as the extreme price suggests the market was not rationally incorporating all of the relevant information into this. So it would be in violation of the strong form. And then for our verify stage, the driver um most clearly violated the semi-trong form um because the stock price roughly $483 severely decoupled from the publicly available fundamental value of $10 to $40. So there was a very clear discrepancy between those values um which is the most prominent out of the violation for the forms. And then overall this suggests that during the hard behavior markets can fail to rationally incorporate public fundamental data. So just our evolve stage taking Matt's piece and incorporating it on a higher level. The third question of this assignment. So evaluate whether the rational investors could have profited systematically. So one bases the decision solely off of intrinsic value and risk. So we could have made use the GME the GameStop anomaly to make the systematic risk adjusted profits within the research stage or um the price surged to $483 which exceeded the fundamental value of 10 to 40 like we addressed before. and was a um speculative kind of bubble. So interpreting this a rational investor, excuse me, would short sell the stock. Um however, the short squeeze phenomenon created the unlimited risk for the short sellers. And then to answer the question, so no, a rational investor could not really have profited systematically off of this while the trader guessed the peak and profited. A rational strategy was based off the intrinsic value or the shorting which exposed them to the extreme unquantifiable and ultimately unsustainable risk due to the unique shorts dynamic. And then the systematic profits relies on predictive price correlation which was impossible at the time. So to answer that question, no, just because of the unreliability and the short squeeze kind of dynamic as a whole. And then this risk profile of the squeeze um transformed a fundamentally rational trade. So shorting an overvalued asset into a highly speculative gamble um which prevents the systematic profit. So it doesn't necessarily align very well and it has kind of conflicting um views. So leads to no for the for the question there on whether investors could have profited systematically and then again so comparing efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior. Let's take a look here. So essentially we're comparing the um market expectations to what actually happened with the GameStop. So for the research phase, the prediction was that the price should have reflected the fundamental value. Again, the $10 to $40. Um, and the new information that's investment should lead to a small immediate price adjustment and the shock should follow a random walk, which essentially is unpredictable price change around its true values. That's the prediction for the for the efficient market hypothesis. Now, our observed behavior for the interpret part of driver was that the price sparked to $483 um driven by the coordinated retail buying creating a massive short squeeze event. Not based on fundamental information, the price was not close to its true value. So definitely not um following our prediction very well at all. Verify prediction versus observation. So the officially efficient market predicted a failure of the price um to stay at the $483 which eventually crashed um and it failed to predict the extreme magnitude and duration of the anomaly and the massive decoupling from fundamental value is the core contradiction and then evolve stage. So the event shows that the markets are conditionally affected or efficient under extreme coordinated pressure and high short intense market mechanisms break down allowing price to disconnect drastically from um fundamentals. So just again reinstating how the prediction in the behavior was quite off. And lastly to go to this assessing the behavioral finance explanations for those observed anomalies. So identifying those behavioral biases that explain the price surge and the sustainment. So going back to what we had just talked about. So researched the R stage and driver um the key drivers through this Reddit community, the Wall Street Bets community, social media hype coordinated action against the establishment. So or the hedge funds. So it was very kind of hyped up to more what it was and then interpreting this so they're hurting behavior or social proof. the retailer traders found followed the crowd on Reddit believing the collective ashen was rational. So really just hurting all of those behaviors having a specific like quote unquote ring leader somebody who really encourages the rest of the people to follow their movements and to do what they're doing. Then also too we have some confirmation bias. So really focusing only on the positive Reddits and ignoring the fundamental risks and values, the gamblers policy or sensation seeking. So treating the market as a casino or as a game um driven by that that thrill and potential for those gains rather than seeing the really risk um return profiles. So more paying attention to the what they could be receiving instead of the risk the sentiment and mood. So having a strong collective anti-wall street sentiment fueled the meme stock movement which overrided the traditional analysis. So kind of tying back to that hurting behavior just kind of getting everybody on the same page making it out to be something that it's not necessarily is. And then overall the behavioral finance um provides a strong explanation. The anomaly was driven by this investor settlements social coordination and cognitive biases rather than the rational fundamental analysis or directly challenging the efficient market um hypothesis assumption of those rational agents. So kind of ignoring all that rationality and just going with the flow. Then as a whole the biases created a large temporary price bubble or anomalies um that were eventually corrected which suggested a middle ground essentially that the markets were mostly efficient but prone to those behavioral um bubbles. So to answer all of those questions, I then created a Python code in Google Collab just kind of visually stating what um went down in this market for GameStop. So again, just to really drive this visual representation through the driver stage, the um the visualization shows the massive spike for the exceeding the estimated fundamental value of like $25. And then the demonstrates a significant violation of the semi- strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Excuse me. So we'll see here this blue line representing the stock itself or the GameStop and really exceeding that around um this area here. So the estimated fundamental value was roughly $25. This is a red dotted line here and the start of the major squeeze is this green line here. So we this is where we really start to see things shift and change as you can tell from the data showcasing that very massive um spike. So the actual price was between $4 and $6. And this visual representation really does demonstrate that. Um comparing it to the stated claim that it was being traded at less than a dollar in August of 2020. Well, we're able to see that here. And obviously that still wasn't very correct, but then we see this massive spike over here. Just again really taking that visualization um or representation of how kind of inaccurate that was and the anomaly itself of having these biases and paying more attention to the potential return rather than the risk and just showcasing what inaccuracies really can do. when we are measuring all of this this data and um yeah again just kind of showcasing those markets and what can can go wrong when they're not necessarily efficient. So thanks and uh have a good night.",,0,1

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,770
Hello, this is Holden
Hegby, and right now

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,060
we're looking at the
script that Python

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,690
create for me for
session eight, I believe.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,490
And this one is
about a market

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,690
efficiency analysis
of GameStop.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,810
and this is just
investigating the 2020 to

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,570
2021 short squeeze were
just skyrocketed for

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,050
a little bit and this
is just to use efficient

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,210
efficient market
hypothesis we're using

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,080
that to look at what
happened here and so

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,470
here in section one
we are looking at the

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,090
defining discover where
we set the stage and

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,270
state the price and
actual price and variables

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,090
the stated price what
the the assignment

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,190
said was four cents
but the actual was four

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,570
dollars and it was
just from checking the

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,370
historical data and
showing um split adjusted

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,690
low in August 2020 was
around one dollar and

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,290
it's actual not adjusted
low was around four

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:38,190
dollars and yeah so
the professor for to

21
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,110
find and discover I
checked the historical

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,790
price data for GME the
assignment states a price

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,230
of four cents but and
in August 2020 but

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,010
the lowest price I could
find from that month

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,070
was around four dollars
or one dollar split

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,160
adjusted I believe
this may be a typo for

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,570
mine for my analysis
I will proceed using

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,820
correct historical figure
of four dollars and

29
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,050
the event timeline of
this is August 2020

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,390
to September 2020 and
then January 2021 and

31
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,610
late January 2021 and
February 2020 so in

32
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,030
August the price was
low four to five dollars

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,880
seen as a failing brick
-and-mortar store and

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,080
then in September the
founder of chewy via

35
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,810
13% stake signate for
signaling belief in a

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,710
turnaround for the
company and then in 2021

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,670
um reddit coordinates
massive buying

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,630
campaign and then 2021
and or late january

39
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,730
uh price surges to an
intraday high of 483

40
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,310
per share and then
in february the price

41
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,310
crashed everybody sold
um and then congressional

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,350
hearings um were
there after all that

43
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,620
mess um and then the
short interest that

44
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,070
peaked at 140 percent
which is extremely high

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,310
and then the key players
were retail traders

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,110
versus hedge hedge
funds and then the

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,790
market anomaly trading
platforms like robin

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,150
restricted buying of
gme and the victim

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,230
melvin capital lost
53 percent in january

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,610
requiring a 2.75 billion
dollar bailout which

51
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,310
is insane and then a
fundamental value most

52
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,690
analysis analysts value
the company between

53
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,590
10 to 40 dollars per
share and we can just

54
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,470
go and look at the
output for this section

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,890
i'll basically say
just about the same

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,610
thing um sorry i'm all
the way at the bottom

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,170
yeah so here the
critical first step

58
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,530
same way to verify
the four cents

59
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,090
um the actual low
is four dollars

60
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,370
and that statement
was incorrect

61
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,010
and the appropriate
communication

62
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,690
for the professor
here's the

63
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,150
professional way
to address this

64
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,230
Professor, for the
Define and Discover

65
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,270
section, I checked
the historical

66
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,610
price of GMU,
the assignment

67
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,630
states a price of
four around, yeah.

68
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,770
So we've like seen that

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,890
above, let's go back.

70
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,770
And then the case
study, this is

71
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,130
just all the given
data, and then

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,490
now we can go
to section two.

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,990
so this is the
represent stage

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,730
finding key theories and

75
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,170
formulas needed
for this analysis

76
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,210
and the efficient
market hypothesis this

77
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,060
is a theory that says
the stock price already

78
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,150
reflects all available
information this

79
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,910
means it's impossible
to beat the market

80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,650
consistently uh there
are three forms or

81
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,310
levels of emh week
form which is you can't

82
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,260
predict future prices
by looking at uh

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,170
past private price
movements uh semi-strong

84
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,210
form the price already
includes all public

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,130
information um and
then strong form the

86
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,550
price includes all
public and private it,

87
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,890
which is insider
information.

88
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,230
And then behavioral
finance. This theory

89
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,210
argues that EMH is
wrong because investors

90
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,150
are human and not
always rational.

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,670
People make
predictable mistakes

92
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,630
or biases driven
by psychology.

93
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,180
And some of the key
biases for GameStop

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,990
was hurting. Everybody
on reddit was buying

95
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,490
uh so they should
too and then

96
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,790
overconfidence we can
beat the hedge funds we

97
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,550
are smarter and then
anchoring i bought at

98
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,670
300 i won't sell
until it's back at 300

99
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,350
um which is just
ignoring new

100
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,170
information given
and then concept

101
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,810
three is limits
to arbitrage

102
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,190
um arbitrage is the
exact or is the act

103
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,790
of fixing the wrong
price for a profit uh

104
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,070
the smart money like
hedge funds should

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,440
be able to do this
uh limits arbitrage

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,710
are the real world
reasons why this fails

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,450
um so these are the
limits to arbitrage

108
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,330
uh risk the wrong
price can get even

109
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,030
wronger um before it
gets better like how gme

110
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,310
went from 100 to 400
uh when it's like

111
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,730
just a 40 stock um
and then cost it costs

112
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,270
money to short a stock
um which is you are

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,320
banking on the stocks
going down so and

114
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,050
like you make money
off of the stock going

115
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,050
down um constraint a
hedge fund can run out

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,510
of money before the
market becomes rational

117
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,270
and then here's the
formula for abnormal

118
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,930
return this is the
main tool for an event

119
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,770
study it measures
surprise returns so AR

120
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,890
for abnormal return
equals actual return

121
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,670
minus expected return
and actual return is

122
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,430
what the stock actually
did and then expected

123
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,130
return what the stock
should have done

124
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,410
based on its risk and
the second formula

125
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,170
is the CAPM and as
I calculate expected

126
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,490
return for the abnormal
return formula the

127
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,080
expected return equals
risk-free rate plus

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,710
parentheses beta times
market return minus

129
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,470
risk-free rate and
risk-free rate is

130
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,490
what you can earn
with zero risk um

131
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,790
market return what the
whole market returned

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,450
and beta how um
volatile stock is

133
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,770
and we can go down
to the output now

134
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,730
so here's the output
um the concept stating

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,850
the three three types
that we form semi

136
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,710
-strong strong and then
key biases hurting

137
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,270
overconfidence anchoring
and let me start

138
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,930
arbitrage risk cost
and constraint and then

139
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,390
here's the formulas
so now we can go to

140
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,150
section 3 which is
the implement state

141
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:49,310
implement stage and we
just use both of section

142
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,870
1 and section two to
put them together and

143
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,920
so i think this might
just be easier to

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,470
just look at the output
here um let's see

145
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,150
where are we section
three yeah so analysis

146
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,830
um market efficiency
testing what the emh

147
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,030
violated yes in
spectacular fashion uh

148
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,210
weak form was violated
the entire strategy

149
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,070
was based on momentum
so like there's a bunch

150
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,970
of people saying to
buy buy buy buy and

151
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,650
people bought because
the price was going

152
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,840
up and this is a
predictable predictable

153
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,750
pattern that worked
for weeks and

154
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,570
then a semi-strong
form which was also

155
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,310
violated this is
the most important

156
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,650
violation the public
info number one gme's

157
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,550
fundamental value
was 10 to 40 dollars

158
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,590
and the price of
483 clearly did

159
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,870
not reflect that
and then public

160
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,090
info to the 140
140 short interest

161
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,890
was public data
this information

162
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,710
was inefficiently
priced until

163
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,830
reddit users were
weaponizing it

164
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,430
and then a strong
form which was also

165
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,890
violated um any reddit
user who knew the plan

166
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,590
before it was public
had insider info uh

167
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,430
this form is almost
always violated which

168
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,410
is why um insider
trading is legal so they

169
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,540
all kind of um gather
together to skyrocket

170
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,510
the stock and um so
yeah as you can see

171
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,910
all three of the
forms for EMH were

172
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,510
violated in this and
what this means the GME

173
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,550
event is strong
evidence against a semi

174
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:52,670
-strong market efficiency
and the second

175
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,390
analysis is the behavioral
finance analysis

176
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,390
this event is a
perfect case study for

177
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,770
behavioral finance
hurting so the example for

178
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,250
hurting millions of
retail investors bought

179
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,570
at the same time
driven by social media

180
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,070
and so it's just a
digital stampede and

181
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,570
overconfidence and anchoring
many investors held

182
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,990
on for the cause
anchoring to the idea of

183
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,190
the crusade and had
way too much confidence

184
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,110
that they could force
a new reality even as

185
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,230
the price fell and
then the limits to

186
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,290
arbitrage this the most
critical point uh rational

187
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,850
investors like the
hedge hedge funds

188
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,060
knew that gme was
overpriced at 100 at 200 uh

189
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,940
so they tried to fix
it by shorting but

190
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,570
they were hit by a
perfect storm of limits

191
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,790
so the risk of that was
the price kept rising

192
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,790
which forced irrational
buying and then

193
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,950
the constraint was
melvin capital ran out of

194
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,170
money um and uh was
forced to buy back

195
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,810
shares at the peak,
making the problem worse.

196
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,450
This is a short
squeeze and the smart

197
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,510
money was bankrupted
by the dumb money.

198
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,390
Third analysis,

199
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,550
rational investor
profitability analysis.

200
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,690
Could a rational investor

201
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,270
have profited from this?

202
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,530
Looking back, it's
easy to say I wish I

203
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,210
bought at $4 and sold
at 483 uh but looking

204
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,390
forward before the event
buying gamestop at 40

205
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,890
dollars was not a
rational investment to

206
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,930
begin with it's pure
gamble and you weren't

207
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,170
betting on the company's
profits you were

208
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,390
kind of just buying it
to just hold a random

209
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,290
stock that wasn't
doing anything with the

210
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,490
company and you were
just betting on social

211
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,130
media movement uh which
is speculation not

212
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,870
systematic strategy
and the conclusion of

213
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,330
this uh no irrational
fundamental investor

214
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,620
would have seen gamestop
at fifty dollars when

215
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,910
fundamentalists said
uh ten dollars and

216
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,240
either shorted it and
lost or stayed away if

217
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,970
you shorted it you
got killed and then or

218
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,350
you stayed away the
profit opportunity was

219
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,950
only available to those
participating in the

220
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,550
irrationality and then
the fourth analysis

221
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,850
was theoretical
implications emh versus

222
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,710
behavioral this case shows
that while the market

223
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,070
is usually efficient
we're using ems it is

224
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,610
vulnerable to behavioral
bubbles um like

225
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,810
uh this case and
active versus passive

226
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,550
management a passive
investor who owns an s&p 500

227
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,770
index fund was fine
this event punished

228
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,650
active investors like
melvin capital who tried

229
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,150
to enforce rational
prices and it shows

230
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,070
that active investing
or like stock picking

231
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,810
is very risky then off
to section four here

232
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,150
this is the verify
section and this is just

233
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,870
to check the work uh
how would a real study

234
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,570
uh verify this they
would use statistics um

235
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,130
an academic would
calculate the abnormal

236
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,350
return for from section
two for every single

237
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,950
um stock and then day
or every single day

238
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,830
in january 2021 and
use it as a t-test to

239
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,690
prove that these returns
were statistically not

240
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,490
zero they would prove
it wasn't just luck

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,510
and for this assignment
we don't need

242
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,970
complex stats our
verification is

243
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,830
simpler a stock with
a 40 to 10 to 40

244
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,430
fundamental value
traded at 483 this

245
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,570
is self-evidently
in abnormal return

246
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,510
a major hedge fund
melbourne capital was

247
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,770
bankrupted uh this
verifies the event was real

248
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,390
and significant and
brokerages um like robin

249
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,950
hood had to halt
trading uh this verifies

250
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,730
the event broke the
normal market plumbing

251
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,150
yeah so robin hood had
to stop all trades on

252
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,590
gamestop like i said
before and then a real

253
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,730
study would also ask
was this just a gamestop

254
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,710
thing uh they would
check if other meme

255
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,550
stocks like amc
blackberry and nokia also

256
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,470
moved at the same time
uh the fact that they

257
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,200
did makes behavioral hurting
um a huge explanation

258
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,010
uh which is more
robust and stronger

259
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,710
and more believable i
only remember amc from

260
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,190
this whole game something
but i was pretty

261
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:55,950
young and so we can go
back down to the section

262
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,090
4 just to look at the
output and yeah so

263
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,970
statistical the returns
were statistically

264
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,130
not zero and they prove
it wasn't just luck

265
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,270
so yeah basically says
the same thing and

266
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,310
then we can go to
section 5 here so this is

267
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,370
the evolved stage and
we apply our insights

268
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,650
to investment strategy
to show the abnormal

269
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,770
return calculation in
action let's just go to

270
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,490
the output here I think
that'll be simpler

271
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,630
okay so the evolved
stage calculating the

272
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,970
abnormal return for
GameStop in January 2021

273
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,570
let's use our formula
from section two to

274
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,330
show how abnormal the
gamestop return was the

275
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:51,010
actual return was 1641
.9 while the expected

276
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,490
return was seven
percent that is a crazy

277
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,010
actual return and this
means gamestop's price

278
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,550
uh went up by over
about 1600 percentage

279
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,130
points and then it's
like more than its risk

280
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,110
um which is beta and the
market's return would

281
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,250
ever predict so this
is the definition of

282
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,250
an anomaly and the evolved
investment strategy

283
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,530
what does this event
teach us as investors

284
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,510
uh for passive investors
this event proves

285
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,610
that passive investing
like owning index

286
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,340
funds is safe and you
ignore all of that

287
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,070
that's going on and then
for active investors

288
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,180
Gamestop event is a
major lesson in limits

289
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,970
to arbitrage. It
teaches that being right

290
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,590
is not the same as
making money. You

291
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,030
can be right and still
go broke if a rational

292
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,730
crowd fights you and
it introduces you

293
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,010
to new risk, which
is social media risk.

294
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,230
Now, section six.

295
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,910
This is a
reflect where you

296
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,130
synthesize the
two big ideas.

297
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,170
and the behavioral
finance so the emh theory

298
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,670
versus behavioral
gamestop does not mean the

299
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,130
efficient markets
efficient market hypothesis

300
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,870
is wrong on most days
for most stocks the

301
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,620
market is mostly
efficient semi-strong news

302
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,390
comes out and the price
adjusts quickly this

303
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,110
is emh in action however
the gamestop event

304
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,190
is the perfect explanation
that proves the

305
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,130
rule it shows that the
market is not a perfect

306
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,850
logical machine it's
a complex system run

307
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,690
by us as stockholders
and image describes

308
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,270
the machine on a normal
day behavioral finance

309
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,970
describes what happens
when the human operate

310
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,130
operators driven by
hurting greed or fear

311
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,210
override the machine
and send it off the

312
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,170
rails and the gme case
shows that financial

313
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,710
reality is a mix of both
theories markets try

314
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,510
to be efficient but
they are always at the

315
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,410
mercy of us as investors
at the mercy of our

316
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,690
psychology which can
create spectacular bubbles

317
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,590
and crashes that image
cannot predict or

318
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,690
explain now we can go
to the output here so

319
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,850
it just says the
basically same

320
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,390
thing here and
yeah thank you

Hello, I'm John and today for session
0:04
eight, we're going to be going over our
0:05
market efficiency and behavioral finance
0:08
unit. Um, so first step in our driver
0:12
framework is to define and discover what
0:14
we're looking at here. So for our
0:16
assignment going to be investigating
0:18
market efficiency using the GameStop
0:21
short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021 as
0:26
a case study. Verify the accuracy of
0:28
stated facts. Analyze price behaviors uh
0:32
behavior relative to efficient market
0:35
hypothesis predictions and evaluate
0:38
whether market anomalies constitute
0:41
evidence against market efficiency or
0:44
can be explained within existing
0:46
frameworks. And we're given some of this
0:51
information too. So we have um our event
0:54
timeline. That's it right there. We have
0:56
our critical first step right here. Um
1:00
verify the statement uh of GameStop
1:03
traded at uh 4 cents in August 2020
1:06
against actual uh historical data. And
1:09
we have some key key data points. So um
1:14
there's those five key data points right
1:16
there. And we're going to be looking
1:18
over these required analysis steps for
1:20
the most part. And so we're going to be
1:23
verifying that all stated high
1:25
historical prices uh and price data and
1:29
document corrections. So we're going to
1:32
be just verifying all those.
1:35
Test which form of market efficiency was
1:39
violated. So weak, semi-strong, and
1:40
strong.
1:42
Evaluate whether rational investors
1:45
could have profited systematically.
1:48
Compare efficient market hypothesis
1:50
predictions to observed behavior and
1:53
assess behavioral finance and
1:55
explanations for observed
1:58
uh anomalies.
2:00
Okay.
2:03
Implementing and uh representing with
2:06
AI. Uh have written some code. So
2:12
uh it just runs uh lots of tasks for me.
2:17
Um, and we're going to be looking at
2:20
some outputs. So, I have tasks on this
2:24
two through six we're looking at. So, we
2:26
have uh price data,
2:29
um, we have chart, we have volume data,
2:33
we have uh the form tests, and we have
2:38
our um,
2:41
uh, C uh, chart here. And so using all
2:47
of that
2:48
I had developed this code as well uh
2:52
with AI to be able to just generate the
2:55
quick report on the analysis of those
2:59
five. So
3:03
uh quick overap of room you're looking
3:06
at uh to quickly answer everything is
3:09
that the claim of 4 cents is false. The
3:12
actual minimum low price in August 2020
3:18
was $1 on
3:21
uh August 3rd.
3:24
Now
3:25
uh we have our market efficiency tests
3:28
uh wheat form violated uh the Elgen box
3:32
test p value extremely low and since
3:35
it's smaller than 05
3:38
uh past returns can predict the future
3:42
returns uh proves correlation with
3:45
statistical significance and semi-
3:48
strong efficiency violated as the c um
3:52
by um February
3:56
uh 5th of 2021 was plus 291 or plus 291%
4:04
and that challenges efficient market
4:07
hypothesis predictions as prices
4:10
detached from public fundamentals
4:13
rational investor uh profitability the
4:17
the strong and positive C of plus 291% %
4:22
shows that systematically abnormal
4:24
profits were possible. Um, and the event
4:28
was not just rational risk pricing.
4:33
Um,
4:40
now
4:44
um efficient market hypothesis
4:47
predictions and behavioral explanations.
4:50
we have um that the price hit $483
4:55
uh versus the analyst values of $10 to
4:59
$40. Um this and the massive volume
5:02
points to behavioral factors such as
5:05
hurting social media um over EM
5:10
and mean volume uh was almost 10 times
5:13
higher um in January 2021 compared to
5:17
quarter 3 of 2022.
5:20
um which is the evidence of an anomaly.
5:23
So, now that we went over those um quick
5:26
answers for all of them, we're going to
5:28
go take a deep dive into um
5:32
why uh they are. So our first step is uh
5:38
our right here in task two is that um we
5:45
had
5:47
ran the um
5:51
uh Python code um importing the um the Y
5:58
finance libraries
6:00
um to help us grab historical data
6:04
um using these functions here. And so it
6:09
grabbed historical data and it came back
6:13
with the actual minimum value was $1 on
6:17
um August 3rd of 2020.
6:21
So we can successfully say that the
6:24
claim is false.
6:27
Now
6:32
going on,
6:34
we have our tasks three
6:39
and four,
6:41
which is uh our
6:44
um
6:50
uh volume and um volume for four and
6:54
price and volume for um in this little
6:58
chart here. So um
7:06
I it's the the chart speaks for itself.
7:09
It it's near bankrupt the whole way
7:13
through and then all the sudden the uh
7:18
the clos price just explodes
7:21
during this uh January 2021 squeeze. it
7:25
it it takes off. It it shoots up the the
7:29
price. It shoots up the volume
7:32
um over said dates. Uh this chart is
7:35
looking at uh between January of 2022
7:38
and January of 2020.
7:41
Um and you can just see that before uh
7:46
2021 it's it's flatlined. It's it's
7:49
almost bankrupt. And then all the sudden
7:52
it it the stock price explodes and takes
7:56
off.
7:58
And
7:59
we can see that um with the mean and
8:04
median volume um
8:07
taking an almost 10 times increase um
8:12
between quarter 3 of 2022 and January of
8:16
2021.
8:18
Um, now
8:23
we're going to be going on to our Elgen
8:26
box test. And so we just use this test
8:31
to check for autocorrelation.
8:33
Um, and that is really just
8:39
um do the past prod uh prices predict
8:43
future prices? So um this is just a
8:46
standard hypothesis test and um so we
8:50
would have uh this test we're running
8:53
against our um null hypothesis which is
8:58
um
9:00
that past prices do not predict future
9:03
prices. And because we have a value of
9:08
uh such such a large or or small we have
9:14
such a small p value that we can safely
9:19
reject
9:21
um our null hypothesis because it's
9:23
below um 05 for our p value. And um
9:28
because we reject our null hypothesis um
9:32
we can statistically prove that um it
9:35
can predict future prices uh the past
9:38
prices can predict the future uh prices
9:41
uh proving um significant
9:45
autocorrelation here and because of that
9:48
weak form efficiency is violated.
9:52
Um
9:54
lastly we have our C
9:59
uh chart here. And so it this tells us a
10:03
lot about um everything we're looking at
10:07
here. Um so we have it's just our total
10:12
abnormal returns and um the abnormal um
10:17
returns can prove um anomalies.
10:21
And so
10:26
we're going to we pretty much proved
10:29
that uh the claim is false and we're
10:31
just going to be going over our analysis
10:34
again just to cross reference that with
10:36
above.
10:37
um market efficiency tests the weak form
10:41
p value violated
10:43
um it's no longer uh
10:49
it's it's suggesting significant
10:51
autocorrelation so it's proven there now
10:56
semi-strong efficiency is also violated
10:59
um because of the C was up 291%
11:05
which challenges EMA H as prices detach
11:08
from public fundamentals.
11:11
Um
11:14
yes.
11:17
So we can go grab that chart real quick.
11:20
And you can see
11:22
it it it spikes here. Um, and this this
11:28
spike is a huge um anomaly. And that's
11:33
what this is referring to here where
11:37
it's violated as it went up
11:41
291%.
11:43
Um meaning that um in efficient market
11:48
hypothesis predictions the prices were
11:51
not the same as um what they would have
11:54
been for um the public fundamentals
11:58
because um here it's been predicted that
12:01
they would be at 10 to $40 and that is
12:05
just not the case. Now rational investor
12:09
profitability
12:10
uh we went over that um the strongly
12:13
positive C
12:15
um of plus 291 shows that systematically
12:19
abnormal profits were possible um and
12:24
that the event was not just a rational
12:27
uh risk pricing. Um
12:33
and so
12:36
going into that um
12:40
our evaluate whether rational investors
12:42
could have profited systematically and
12:45
short answer would be yes potentially
12:48
because um since we form was violated we
12:53
can just assume that um a momentum based
12:57
uh strategy could have been used. Um, so
13:01
that's uh if the price went up uh
13:04
yesterday
13:06
uh then I could buy today and vice
13:09
versa. And using that strategy
13:13
um you could have profited heavily. Um
13:16
and you can see that on our price and
13:20
volume chart. Price goes up a little
13:22
bit. Same with volume. you start buying
13:25
and you know once you once you start
13:28
buying when it goes up that little bit
13:30
there uh your profit just surged through
13:33
the roof. Um so using the um um rational
13:40
investors um if they were systematically
13:43
they could have profited from that. And
13:47
last to compare efficient market
13:49
hypothesis predictions to observed
13:50
behavior. And so
13:53
um
13:56
I mean
13:59
efficient market hypothesis predictions
14:01
just have have failed on this because
14:04
they predict zero abnormal returns and
14:08
this code here calculates far from zero.
14:12
this huge spike alone disproves um a
14:18
efficient market hypothesis in this case
14:21
scenario
14:23
um just because of this massive spike
14:25
right there in the abnormal returns and
14:28
because of that abnormal return um we
14:30
can um
14:33
pretty much conclude that um
14:38
uh there is a huge evidence of anomaly
14:42
There's the volume
14:45
the volume went up
14:48
10 times um
14:52
where is that right here from from mean
14:56
and median volume of quarter 3 2020 and
15:00
January of 2021 it went up almost 10
15:03
times um which supports uh our
15:09
um analysis report that it it is an
15:14
anomaly. And um looking at the um
15:18
behavioral explanations for the observed
15:22
um anomaly is that um
15:27
because it it hit huge prices compared
15:31
to what uh analyst values. Um
15:36
also including um the massive volumes it
15:39
points to hurting and social media over
15:44
efficient market hypothesis predictions.
15:47
Um and so basically all that is is just
15:51
instead of um staying to efficient
15:54
market hypothesis predictions in the
15:57
case of GameStop um social media um
16:03
um and like momentum just took over um
16:08
for the company and everybody heard it
16:10
together to buy which created uh a huge
16:14
surge in volume and price. Um, which is
16:18
the behavioral explanation of
16:22
um the surge in not only our cumulative
16:27
abnormal returns, our median and mean
16:32
volumes, but also our price as well. Um,

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Graham Hubertz, doing the
Session 8, Assignment for Management 310.
So our assignment overview, investigate
market efficiency using the GameStop short
squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case
study. Verify the accuracy of stated
facts, analyze price behavior relative to
efficient market hypothesis predictions,
and evaluate whether market anomalies
constitute evidence against market efficiency
or can be explained within existing
frameworks. So our critical first step, verify
the statement. GameStop traded at $0.04 in
August 2020 against actual historical data.
If incorrect, document the accurate
figures and determine appropriate communication
approach for correcting the professor.
Event Timeline August 2020, GameStop Nears

Out Analysts' fundamental value estimates

Verify all stated historical price
data and document corrections.
Test which form of market efficiency weak,
semi to strong, strong was violated.
Evaluate whether rational investors could
have profited systemically. Compare
efficient market hypothesis predictions to
observe behavior. Assess behavioral finance
explanations for observed anomalies.
So driver framework requirement.
So driver is my analytical work
process, not a documentation format.
So I put all this into Google Gemini.
I had said I have an assignment
over this. Use the KISS method. Keep
it simple and stupid to complete it.
Export it into Python code on Collab when
done. I also have it follow the driver
framework as well. so I'll go over to collab
and here it is so let's go through it so
instructions open a new work notebook and
Google collab paste this entire script into
a single code cell click the play button
to run the cell so here we go the script is
gonna go through it all so D for define
investigate the GameStop short squeeze as a
case study for the efficient market hypothesis
so we must verify the statement.
GameStop traded at four cents in August 2020.
We will use the Y Finance library to pull
real historical data to check this. We also
need to get the peak price from January 2021.
So R represent our KISS plan.
Implement. Download all GameStop historical
data using the Y Finance library.
We verify. We isolate the data from
August 2020 and find the actual low price.
Compare this to the four cents claim.
Find the actual high price
in January to February, 2021.
Evaluate. Use simple comments to
analyze the data against the EMH.
Report. Print the findings and show
a simple graph of the price surge.
So, here we go. We implement our
data. We get the historical data
for the last five years. Stock
prices are auto -adjusted for splits.
And we go through verify.
We check the facts from the assignment.
Our critical first step, verify the four
cents claim. our filter data for August 2020.
We find the lowest low
price during the month.
The claim that it was traded at four cents
is incorrect. The prices are split adjusted.
The 2022 stock split makes past prices
appear lower, so we verify the 2021 peak.
The actual highest price during
January 2021 was 483, so So this
figure is confirmed as correct.
So we evaluate. We analyze
the findings, KISS version.
So analysis one, how to communicate
4 cents error to the professor.
Our KISS approach would be professor.
For the assignment, I used a Python library
to pull the official historical stock
data. The data shows the split adjusted low
for August 2020 was around $1 or $4 pre-shift,
not 4 cents. I believe the 4 cents figure
in the prompt might have been a typo.
I've used the correct data for my analysis.
So,
we go through all these analysis
ones as well, and our conclusion,
the GameStop event is a classic example
of a semi-strong form violation.
We have the same thing for analysis three,
could rational investors have profit
systemically? No, it wasn't a systemic profit, it
was a high-risk event -driven trade. and
analysis for behavior finance to emh the event
is a poster child for behavioral finance
herd behavior millions of retail traders
coordinating a reddit to act as a single massive
whale overconfidence retail traders
believe they could and did beat multi-billion
dollar hedge funds hedge funds excuse me
prospect theory yolo many investors were trading
with stimulus money treating it like a
casino loss aversion was low they're willing
willing to hold the line even at a 90% loss,
which is not rational investor behavior.
And we'll go back to analysis two as well.
I accidentally skipped over it. Which
form of market efficiency was violated?
The weak form failed. This says you can't
predict future prices by looking at past
price movements. Our semi-strong form
failed. This says you can't profit from
publicly available information such as news
company reports and short interest data.
Our verdict is it's clearly violated. And
our strong form was failed. This says you
can't profit even from private insider
information.
Our verdict, it's not relevant.
This event was driven by public
data, not insider trading.
Conclusion or GameStop event is a classic
example of a semi -strong form violation.
So now we'll go into E,
or excuse me, R.
So R, we go into report.
Show the final result.
We plot the price, focusing on the
key period. Use a long scale on
the y-axis to make the pre-squeeze
prices.
And here's our data here.
Our log scale is key to
seeing the explosion.
So now we add an arrow
to point out the squeeze.
And with all this information
here, our analysis is complete.
Thank you for listening, and that's
the end of my session 8 assignment.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello everyone. This is Chris Heisman
and today we're looking at the session
eight assignment on market efficiency.
So to begin we're going to start with
our defined stage um and define the
problem. So the primary objective is to
analyze the uh GameStop short squeeze.
Um we will test uh this event against
three forms of the market efficient a
efficient market hypothesis and evaluate
whether the behavioral finance or
classical uh efficient market hypothesis
provides better explanation for the
observed price action. But before we do
this uh we're tasked with verifying this
statement. GameStop was traded at 04
uh cents in August 2020.
And based on historical data queries uh
this statement is false. And uh this
historical data right here uh is going
to show that the uh stock was traded
from 1.04 to $1.67.
Uh so this following code installs the
uh data set for our analysis and also
verifies uh GameStop stock. And as you
can see um
it never was 04.
Okay. So now that we have the data from
uh y uh from Yahoo Finance,
let's move on to the represent stage. So
our analysis will be implemented um
using uh spy data and GME data uh loaded
previously. So, we're going to visualize
uh we're going to create a primary chart
showing the GME adjusted closing price
and GME is GameStop.
And we'll take a look at some um
uh some uh investments
including Ryan Cohen's investment uh the
peak price and Robin Hood trading.
Um we're going to take a look at the
week form uh EMH test. We're going to
overlay a 50-day to 200 day simple
moving average. Um so if it's weak um it
shouldn't predict uh future returns.
Then we're going to take a look at the
semi- strong form test where we're going
to analyze price reaction around uh key
public news events.
And then we're going to do a behavioral
and risk analysis in the evolve stage.
So we'll move beyond uh the EMH to
quantify behavioral aspects. So here uh
we're just going to confirm that our
data is downloaded. So we have GameStop,
we have the SPY data,
S&P 500.
Okay. So now let's implement the
problem. So in this stage, we're going
to execute the first part of our plan.
We're going to calculate the 50 day and
200 day simple moving average of the
weak form test and create a primary
visualization.
um
of the GE adjusted close price and the
SMAs
um
yes okay this chart will be the
foundation of our analysis. So this code
right here creates the primary
visualizations
lots of stuff and here we go. So now we
can see
uh we can see here Ryan coin buys 13%.
And then the surge so the red surge
begins and then over here towards there
we're going to have the Robin Hood
restrictions.
So
yeah now we that's where we can see um
the SMA fluctuations.
Okay. So let's validate this. the charts
from uh this is going to help us
validate the hypothesis.
So this plot confirms the uh narrative
the price is low and stable and then
exponential price surge occurred
um and it closed at 86.88.
Um and obviously this shows a massive
spike clearly supporting the 10-fold
increase in retail trading. Uh so the
weak form test was violated. The price
chart shows a classic momentum anomaly.
The price crossed above its 50 and 200
day SMA in late 200 I'm sorry 2020 and
then exponentially diverged from them.
So we have generated enormous abnor
abnormal returns
which uh states that past price data
trends cannot be used to earn such
returns. So violated. Uh three, the
semi- strong form EMH test was also
violated.
Uh it was not rational. The public
reaction to it was not rational. Uh so
some public information, Brian Cohen
stake and the uh known high short
interest
reaction instead of price moving
immediately uh it first lagged and then
was wildly overshot
uh any possible fundamental values.
So this overreaction driven by social
media is a clear failure of semi- strong
efficiency.
And fourth the strong form tests was
also violated. This is the easiest to
prove. If this form held the price would
always reflect all information. So the
fact that this price was about $5 in
2020 and 400 plus in 2021 and then 40 in
2021 of February, the price was not
reflecting information accurately. So
the existence of a bubble or squeeze
existed.
So it was a violation of a strong form
image
and yeah so this is just us validating
it. This is just what this code is
doing. Um daily returns calculated GQ
doing a peak squeeze 1,00%.
Whereas the spy during the same period
was nowhere near there. So abnormal
return versus the market. Conclusion,
strong evidence against market
efficiency.
Now let's uh move on to the evolve stage
and take this analysis up a notch. So
our validation confirms that image was
violated
and we want to ask why.
So um the answer lies in behavioral
biases. Uh this was a textbook example
of hurting and overconfidence and
confirmation bias.
Um
limits to arbitrage. EMH assumed that if
prices wrong, rational investors would
step in, short the stock. Well, this
didn't happen. It was already
overshorted and there was a squeeze that
happened. So this forced buying from
shorts added to the buying pressure from
retail, creating a short squeeze and
pushing the price even higher.
And R investor profitability.
Uh that asked the question, could a
rational investor have profited
systematically?
Um in hindsight, yes, but beforehand, no
way, Jose. So the risk was enormous.
The conclusion is that this was not a
systematic profit opportunity.
So uh this code is going to uh show us
uh the analysis including risk. So we'll
go over here. We have a very similar
chart.
This is the GameStock price. So this is
its price and this is its risk. Kind of
nuts. Kind of nuts. So every this is a
this volatility
plot quantifies the extreme irrational
risk during the peak. So yeah, look at
that.
Crazy crazy squeeze.
All right. So this is analysis uh is
going to conclude in the represent
stage.
Um we're just going to overlook
everything. So the assign the uh the
original uh 04 price was false.
Um all the EMH forms were violated. So
weak form, semi-strong and strong
completely violated.
Um this was totally due to behavioral
bias and
uh
arbitrage
and uh
basically I mean in theory uh this event
does not mean markets are never
efficient. It just demonstrates that
they could be profoundly inefficient in
the short term.
Um this event
also supports and refutes uh both active
versus passive. passes investors were
unharmed but most active managers were
destroyed.
So in conclusion uh this is a event
uh that was a powerful argument for the
behavioral finance framework and
highlights rational models are
incomplete without accounting for human
behavior and real world market versions.
And yeah that was my analysis on the
game stop short. Thank you.",,0,1

Hello, my name is Andrew Jacobs and in this video I will be analyzing the GameStop Short Squeeze using a simple event style return model.
0:10
I'll use the driver framework and I'll show how I calculated abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns using Python and Google Collab.
0:18
For the, uh, AI use, I helped AI brainstorm and help me write the code and the outline for the assignment.
0:28
So my first question is whether the GME short squeeze lines up with what semi-strong market efficiency would predict. And after checking the data, I confirmed the squeeze created huge return spikes.
0:40
Which is extremely high volume and, uh, major deviations from normal market behavior. And in the project I used GME as a stock and SPY as the market benchmark.
0:54
Next, I represent the problem using a simple CAPM style idea. Expected return is just beta times market return. Then abnormal return is the actual GME return minus the expected return.
1:07
The CAR or cumulative abnormal return shows how abnormal performances builds up over time. So now I'll go through my code.
1:19
In cell one, I downloaded the data. So in this cell, I didn't saw, uh, why finance import the libraries and download GME and SPY data from August, 2020 through June, 2021.
1:30
Uh, I print the columns to see the structure since Yahoo finance uses a multi-dex format. Here's this code number one.
1:40
Next, uh, cell number two, I extract closing prices. So here I pull out of, uh, out of the closing price for GME and SPY using the multi-dex keys.
1:51
And this gives me clean daily price series for both Next, I compute the return. And cell three, um, I calculate simple daily percent returns for GME and for SPY, and then put them into one data frame.
2:10
Uh, this creates the data set I'll use for abnormal return calculations. Next in cell four, um, in the cell, I set beta equal to one to keep the model simple.
2:24
Uh, expected return is beta times the market return. Abnormal return is GMEs return minus the expected value. And CAR is just a cumulative sum of abnormal returns.
2:38
Next, in cell 5, I plot abnormal returns. So this plot shows the abnormal returns day by day. Uh, the big spike around January, 2021 show the days when GME moved far beyond what the market alone would predict.
2:56
And my last cell, I plot the CAR and this plot shows cumulative abnormal returns. The sharp rise during the squeeze period indicates a major deviation from normal risk-adjusted behavior.
3:13
So in the validate stage, the results clearly show very abnormal, very large abnormal risk returns, and a strong upward CER trend during the squeeze.
3:23
Uh, that behavior is hard to explain with a standard, uh, efficient market model, uh, for investors. This shows how extreme short interest social media coordination and trading constraints can create a huge project, huge price movements that don't match normal fundamentals.
3:46
So, overall, the GME squeeze challenges semi-strong market efficiency because public information alone can't explain this extreme abnormal returns. The code and the charts help visualize the unusual.
4:00

How unusual this event actually was. And that completes my analysis and code demo. So thank you everyone for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, this is session 8
0:02
assignment. In this assignment, we're
0:04
going to investigate market efficiency
0:05
using the GameStop short squeeze event
0:07
of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. Going
0:10
to verify the accuracy of the stated
0:11
facts, analyze price behavior relative
0:13
to efficient market hypothesis
0:14
predictions and evaluate whether market
0:16
anomalies constitute evidence against
0:18
market efficiency. So the defining the
0:21
problem the core problem is to use
0:23
GameStop short squeeze 2020 as a case
0:25
study to test efficient market
0:28
hypothesis. Goal one, verification.
0:30
Critically verify all the stated facts,
0:32
especially the claim. GameStop traded at
0:34
0.04 cents in August 2020. Correct any
0:37
inaccuracies. Goal two, EMH testing. Um,
0:41
determine which form of efficient market
0:44
hypothesis, weak, semi- strong, or
0:46
strong, were violated in the GME price
0:48
behavior. Goal three explanations.
0:50
Evalue if the observed price anomalies.
0:52
The surge can be explained with the
0:54
traditional EMH frameworks or behavior
0:57
finance explanations are necessary. Goal
1:00
four profitability assess the systematic
1:02
profitability for a rational investor
1:05
considering risk and market constraints
1:08
limit to uh arbitrage initial discovery
1:11
and critical fact checking the
1:12
assignment hinges on the timeline and um
1:14
key data points. The first and most
1:16
critical steps is verifying the initial
1:17
price claim. So the statement GME traded
1:20
at U 4 cents in August 2020 is highly
1:23
suspect as a stock trading that low
1:25
would typically be dislisted or on the
1:27
verge of total collapse which GME was
1:29
not. The statement traded at 4 cents is
1:32
incorrect. Accurate figures. The closing
1:34
prices for GME in August 2020 were in
1:37
the range of $14 to $167 adjusted for
1:40
subsequent stock splits. The lowest
1:42
closing price listed in the search
1:43
results were $14 cents on August 3rd and
1:46
August 7th, 2020. The correction should
1:49
be documented clearly and respectfully.
1:51
State the professor's claim, the actual
1:53
data range and the his source historical
1:56
stock data. Communication, you know,
1:58
obviously use KIS's principle. My
1:59
initial data verification shows the
2:01
stated price is incorrect. Game stocks
2:02
did not trade at 4 cents in August 2020.
2:05
Historical closing prices for August
2:07
2020. Postsplit adjustment were between
2:10
$14 and $167. This directly addresses
2:13
the error without overly verbose
2:15
justification at the start.
2:18
The stage um involves process planning
2:21
an analytical approach using required
2:23
methods of event study methodology
2:25
principle just for this unique case.
2:27
This an analysis will follow uh ESM
2:30
combined recordative analysis of
2:32
behavioral factors. Step one event
2:35
definition which define the event window
2:37
for short squeeze you know weak to
2:39
semi-trong um and define a pre-event
2:42
window and an event window from January
2:43
1st to February 15, 2021 expected
2:46
return. The goal is to calculate the
2:47
normal expected return for GME. The EMH
2:51
uh form is weak. Use market uh model
2:54
capital asset pricing model with the
2:57
market S&P 500 to eliminate alpha and
3:00
beta. Abnormal return AR. Calculate the
3:03
AR with this following formula. It is
3:06
weak/ semi- strong and you're going to
3:08
compare GME actual daily return to its
3:10
actual expected return. Fourth is um C.
3:14
some the daily ARS over the win. It's
3:17
weak and semi- strong and it's a
3:19
statistically significant car um
3:22
suggested market anonymally and
3:24
behavioral evaluation explain the source
3:26
of anonymally semi- strong and qual
3:29
qualitative assess public information.
3:31
So now we're going to go over to our
3:32
Python code that um code that Gemini did
3:35
for us and we're going to run it to make
3:36
sure first it um is goes through.
3:39
Perfect. Now we're going to start to
3:41
analyze. As you can see right here,
3:44
first step is we're going to define the
3:47
parameters and downloaded data. Critical
3:50
fact verification. The driver step
3:51
verified statement that GameStop traded
3:53
at 0.04 cents in August 2020, which
3:56
indeed is not true. Third is we're going
3:58
to market model estimate estimation
4:02
the R step. And then fourth right here
4:05
uh AR abnormal return and c calculation
4:09
define the event window calculate
4:11
expected returns calculate AR calculate
4:14
cumulative AR five is we're going to
4:16
visualization and interpretation
4:18
plotting the car and annotate key events
4:21
interpretations based on the graph
4:23
conclusion the stated price um of 4
4:26
cents is incorrect actual prices were in
4:29
a dollar to $2 range pre-split adjusted
4:32
you know you can see market model
4:34
estimmentation
4:37
um 319 2020 to 1231 2020 and you can see
4:42
the abnormal return analysis from here
4:45
um January 1st 2021 to January to sorry
4:48
um February 15 2021
4:50
and right here you can see visualization
4:52
interpretation we got a lovely graph for
4:54
us GME cumulative abnormal return during
4:57
short squeeze as you can see it's
4:59
starting at 0.0 zero. Slowly in 2001 it
5:03
was you know reached over one and then
5:06
yeah as you can see here the green is
5:08
squeeze peak the red line is RC
5:11
announcement and the blue is c
5:14
interpretation notes magnitude um the
5:17
massive position C expected greater than
5:20
one or less less than 100% log returns
5:22
indicate highly significant abnormal
5:24
performance emulations this systematic
5:26
highly predictable abnormal return
5:28
suggests the weak and semi- strong forms
5:30
terms of EMH were violated as the price
5:32
deviated drastically from fundamental
5:34
value and prior information. Behavioral
5:36
finance the deviation is attributed to
5:39
collective hurting and limits of
5:42
arbitrage allowing the anonymity to
5:44
persist.
5:46
Okay, as you can see here, we were able
5:50
to get that code for us done and now the
5:52
calculation even with the mock data
5:54
clearly shows that the AR during the
5:56
squeeze period was massive. The result
5:58
the C for the window would be
6:00
exceptionally large and positive around
6:02
70%. The existence of a statistically
6:05
significant large C confirm that GME
6:08
price action cannot be explained by
6:10
normal market risk and movement
6:12
classification.
6:13
So as you can see right here we have
6:16
more definitions like for example weak
6:17
form prices reflect all historical price
6:20
and trading data and it shows that it's
6:22
violated and we can see evidence here.
6:24
Semi-trong prices reflect all publicly
6:26
available information. Yes, it's
6:28
violated and in for strong form prices
6:31
reflect all information public and
6:32
private and is likely to be violated.
6:36
Rational investor portfol profitability
6:38
analysis. Could irrational investor have
6:40
profited systematically?
6:42
Um yes it was too risky um and
6:45
constrained. Systematic profitability no
6:48
returns were too volatile and the timing
6:49
was unpredictable. Systematic profit was
6:52
not possible. risk adjustment returns.
6:53
Enormous returns would came with massive
6:55
almost infinite risk. Uh risk adjusted
6:58
return calculation would allow the X and
7:01
expected reward for this level of
7:03
volatility was poor. And then limits to
7:05
arbitrage. This is key. The um rational
7:08
arbitur would identify the mispricing.
7:11
However, selling short to profit
7:12
expected was blocked by transaction cost
7:15
as availability, non-synchronous trading
7:17
and liquidity micro structure.
7:21
Behavioral finance explanation provides
7:23
far better explanation for the GME
7:25
anonymity than the standard EMH.
7:27
Behavioral biases, there's hurting
7:29
behavior, individuals followed actions
7:31
on the group, employing the effect.
7:32
There's confirmation bias and there's
7:34
loss aversion. For example, there's also
7:36
social media influence. Reddit served as
7:38
a platform for information cascade and
7:40
coordinated trading. And then market
7:42
microsstructure issues. The high short
7:44
return of 140% a float revealed a
7:47
significant flaw in market theoretical
7:49
implications. EMH you know the price
7:52
should reflect on a fundamental value of
7:53
10 to $40. Behavioral finance markets
7:57
are subject to noise sentiment and limit
7:59
arbitrage.
8:00
The GME short squeeze does not
8:02
invalidate the EMA entirely, but it
8:05
provides powerful um evidence that the
8:08
strong and semi-strong forms of
8:09
hypothesis can break down due to
8:11
behavioral factors and market
8:13
microructure limits, especially during u
8:16
periods of extreme sentiment. Thank you
8:19
so much for listening and hope you have
8:20
a wonderful day.",,0,1

my session 8,
Market Efficiency

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,880
and Behavioral
Finance assignment.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,940
So, here, sorry.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,760
Here's our assignment
for the week.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,580
Investigate market
efficiency using the

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,720
GameStop short squeeze
event of 2020-2021 as a

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,380
case study. verify the
accuracy of the stated

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,960
facts below analyze
the price behavior

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,100
relative to efficient
market hypothesis

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,780
predictions and evaluate
whether market anomalies

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,520
constitute evidence
market efficiency or

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,280
can be explained within
existing frameworks

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,680
so our first critical
step is verify that

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,720
the statement uh gamestop
traded at four cents

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,060
in august 2020 against
the actual historical

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,940
data that we have
and if this claim is

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,040
false then we're gonna
have to document the

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,300
accurate figures and
determine how appropriate

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,830
communication approach
for correcting

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,420
our professor in this
case so uh our we have

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,420
the event timeline and
key data points and

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,580
required analysis so
now let's go into our

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,360
um collab notebook so
obviously the imported

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,640
libraries that we
have um so we're gonna

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,800
have to solve this with
a driver framework so

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,540
for d define and
discover uh we basically

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,160
have what is the context
of our problem so

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,480
we're taking the case
study of the gamestop

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,200
short squeeze where our
time period is august

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,860
2020 to the present
day and we're trying

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,840
to test efficient market
hypothesis for this

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,760
this on this specific
stock the critical

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,620
fact that we're trying
to verify that we've

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,900
been given by our
professor is that gamestop

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,360
traded at four cents
cents per share in

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,240
august 2020 and if it's
wrong we're going to

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,060
prove that it's wrong
based on the actual

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,560
market data the event
timeline that we have

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,560
is august 2020 gamestop
was near bankruptcy

september 2020 ryan
cohen acquires 13 stake

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,900
january 2021 the price
surges this is due to

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,000
r slash wall street
bets february 2021

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,620
congressional hearings
about it and then 2025 the

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,680
post event stabilization
and key data points

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,140
that we have from
our problem are short

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,980
interest 140 and afloat
retail volume of 10x

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,300
increase during the
squeeze uh robin hood

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,040
halted buying as a trading
restriction there's

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,410
a 50-30 loss with the
required bailout and

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,360
the fundamental value
estimates was 10 to 40

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,880
dollars per share uh
and assuming our um

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,360
understanding of market
efficiency there's three

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,780
forms that we have for
market efficiency the

55
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,880
first one being weak
where prices reflect

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,240
past uh trading info
semi-strong is where

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,560
prices reflect all the
public info that we have

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
so like news and uh
coverage and how strong

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,520
is prices reflect all
of the info the public

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,280
info such as news
outlets and stuff and

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,540
private info and past
info such as uh past

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,720
financial uh cycles of
how gamestop as stock did

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,640
uh required analysis
we're basically trying

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,620
to find uh if the claim
that we're given is

65
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,540
true with our expected
efficient market

66
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,120
hypothesis predictions
versus that what actually

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,280
happened where our
questions are what was

68
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,220
gamestop's actual uh
price in august 2020 uh

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,660
did prices reflect
available information that

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,460
we have uh was the
squeeze predictable or

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,120
exploitable and does
the event disprove um

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,580
what is it efficient
market hypothesis or fit

73
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,280
in so next step we have
is our represent uh

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,720
so that's just we're
gonna take in all our

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,200
data we're still trying
to go by the claim

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,100
that gamestop traded at
four cents uh per share

77
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,680
in august 2020 uh see
so the event timelines

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,540
we have the price ranges
we're still trying

79
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,240
to figure that out as
part of the problem

80
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,280
uh we just have like
the key events as like

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,010
when it went bankrupt
when it surged urged

82
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,360
uh the congressional
hearings because of

83
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,300
it and whether it was
verified or not the

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,140
key metrics were also
uh givens being our

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,540
peak short interest our
retail volume uh how

86
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,320
much gain or like
investors made and so

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,620
here is our actual
represent part which is

88
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,620
our different market
hypothesis predictions

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,260
versus our actual
behavior being, let's just

90
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,240
take it for a weak
form. Our prediction

91
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,360
is that there's no
patterns from the past

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,280
prices and the actual
observed is we are going

93
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,340
to find that out in
our implement step.

94
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,780
So obviously we're
trying to compare the

95
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,880
prediction versus
what actually happened

96
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,740
essentially in this
problem uh scenario is like

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,240
a very basic return
scenario is we buy in

98
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,880
august 2020 price and
then we sell at the peak

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,580
483 dollars per share
so if four cents is

100
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,520
correct that means we
would have a one million

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,000
two hundred seven
thousand four hundred

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,080
percent return so we're
going to be verifying

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,180
this in this problem
obviously off the bat

104
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,560
of that that doesn't
seem very likely as

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,280
that high of a percentage
return but we're

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,000
gonna see in our next
step i implement so uh

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,800
for implement and we're
gonna say okay off the

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,180
data that we uh pulled
from my finance uh

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,340
the august 2020 price
of gamestop was actually

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,720
four dollars not four
cents per share as

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,220
um proclaim in this
problem itself january

112
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,680
2021 was the peak 483
dollars per share and

113
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,300
then november 2025
which is the current uh

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,730
share price which is
25 dollars per share uh

115
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,320
and price correction
more or less was 100x

116
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,640
the factor that we
claimed so let's just

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,880
take this in terms of
the return scenarios that

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,800
i computed here if
we buy and hold the

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,020
peak short uh peak cohen
entry and then the day

120
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,920
peak the entry price
more or less for the

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,460
first two buy and hold
were four dollars the

122
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,040
exit price was either
483 at the week and

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,670
then uh to current day
it's 25 dollars so um

124
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,380
if we sold at the peak
we'd have a return

125
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,880
of 11,975 percent while
current day today it

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,740
would be 525 percent
so almost half the

127
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,580
actual expected return
and if we put in like a

128
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,780
thousand dollars of
investment uh if we sold

129
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,520
at the peak we'd make
roughly around 120

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,880
thousand dollars while
today it's like six

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,920
thousand dollars so
obviously we would have

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,820
been better at uh selling
at the peak itself

133
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,620
because that would have
made us so much more

134
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,120
money compared to what
we have right now.

135
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,120
And then if we
think about it

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,920
in EMH terms and
like each form

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,240
weak, semi-strong
and strong,

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,720
we're just testing
the methods. And we

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,560
can see that evidence
shows that there's a

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
clear upward momentum
for the weak form.

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,780
And it's very likely
that there has been a

142
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,340
violation of efficient
market hypothesis.

143
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,740
other factors to
consider that we have was

144
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,160
like behavioral factors
like quantification

145
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,020
that you know outside
of fact factors

146
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,220
that also impacted the
stock price such as

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,600
social media impact
where our wall street

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,700
bets increase the
price of the share from

149
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,020
like 2 million to 9
million and which is

150
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,860
not compatible with
expected market

151
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,720
hypothesis uh hurting
behavior just how um firms

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,420
are hurting stocks and
stuff fomo intensity

153
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
so okay there's like
a general investor

154
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,640
who's like feeling
very missed out so

155
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
they also put their
money into the stock the

156
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
short squeezes that
we have and then

157
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,740
obviously the market
restrictions and how the

158
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,920
market will impact
such things which are

159
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,550
not all considered an
efficient market uh

160
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,540
hypothesis they all
go against the norm.

161
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,080
But more or less, our

162
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,420
deviation would give us,

163
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,900
since the average
fair value

164
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,240
range is like $10 to $40,

165
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,760
and our midpoint
is $25 per share,

166
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,430
which is what it
is currently today,

167
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,780
our overvaluation
would be 1,832% above

168
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,840
the fundamentals,
more or we have. So

169
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,740
we're going to try
to validate this.

170
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,300
In our next step,
we validate.

171
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,760
So very simply,
I just ran an

172
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,620
explanation
scorecard to check

173
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,420
each of our
evaluation criteria.

174
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,620
I took, in this
case, price

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,800
predictability,
information efficiency,

176
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,500
and shorts, social
media and like other

177
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,520
factors where um we
can see that there's

178
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,740
a lot of things in
this column that buy

179
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
efficient market
theory does not it goes

180
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,740
against the norm so
it does show x and

181
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,000
it fails but in the
actual behavioral

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,960
world of what actually
did happen all these

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,820
are plus and they
did make a very

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,940
significant impact on
the stock price of gm

185
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:16,260
stop in this sense
our emf emh validation

186
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,780
basically followed
with this and said

187
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,440
that past prices don't
predict the future

188
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,400
which is very true
where the past it was

189
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,120
very linear and it
was going towards

190
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,520
bankruptcy while when
we all pumped it up the

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,160
stock up with all social
media and everything

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,040
the stock price
shooted way high up and

193
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,580
people made a lot
of money off of this

194
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,220
as a return last we
have our e um evolve

195
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,060
step so for e i just
ran uh some sensitivity

196
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,300
analysis and scenarios
where um Scenario

197
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,520
one, what if efficient
market hypothesis

198
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,060
held perfectly and
they were as intended,

199
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,940
our EMH prediction
would be the

200
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,700
fundamental price
would be $4, which the

201
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,840
actual reality is
$4. So everything

202
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,960
works in a real
world. All is good.

203
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
It's a scenario of
$4 is $4. We're good.

204
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
It's not $0.04 as in
our flaw of the problem.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,680
scenario two price
sensitivity analysis so

206
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,980
um if we start at
four cents and we have

207
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,300
this insane one million
percent return uh

208
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,340
the current would be
62 000 but putting in

209
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,800
whatever um if we put
in a thousand dollars

210
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,720
we get 12 million in
return that seems very

211
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,940
very unlikely it's
very extreme so it's a

212
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,720
clear violation of
efficient market theory.

213
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,940
Scenario three,
ultra-angle market

214
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,840
structures. What if
something changes in the

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,940
market? More or
less, the pattern

216
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,300
follows that it was
unconventional to efficient

217
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,020
market theory,
as is, and that's

218
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,220
proven in scenario
four or five as well.

219
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,240
Last, our step
R for reflect.

220
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
We're just going
to be answering

221
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,160
our critical
questions. So what was

222
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,140
GameStop's actual
price in 2020?

223
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,900
It was $4 per share,
not $0.04 as was

224
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
given in the problem,
which is flaw.

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,440
And this error doesn't
change the core

226
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,220
conclusion that
this case was a

227
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,620
violation of efficient
market hypothesis.

228
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,200
Second, which forms
of market efficiency

229
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,160
were violated um in
this case weak phones

230
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,520
with flash data was
violated because the

231
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,780
stock price went up while
they were very close

232
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,240
to bankruptcy semi
-strong uh also was

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,490
wrong because we tried
to take uh the actual

234
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,260
news data of how it
was going and all the

235
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,480
news said bankruptcy
but all the social

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,580
media impact from our
such wall street bets

237
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,160
actually inflated
the price and strong

238
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,010
form including all
the data itself was

239
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,480
inconclusive and did not
work at all to influence

240
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,900
this as what actually
happened to the

241
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,840
price of the stock real
world uh could rational

242
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,700
investors have
profited systematically

243
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,960
um i'd say no and
the conclusion is no

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,320
because nobody knew
that um all the social

245
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,400
media impact and the
drive for the stock

246
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,100
would shoot it up so
much and make it such a

247
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,760
profitable trade which
that you can't really

248
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,660
predict it's just a
gamble you have to

249
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,400
it's either you get
lucky or you don't

250
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,740
on this situation
uh how did efficient

251
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,580
market hypothesis
predictions compare to

252
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,080
observed behavior
well they go against

253
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,700
the observed behavior
whatever actually

254
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,660
happened goes against
the entire theory

255
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,440
it was a very
interesting scenario to

256
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,400
take last we have uh
what behavioral uh

257
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,340
finance explanations
with the evidence

258
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,460
Well,

259
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,700
hurting behavior is
one of them where

260
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,620
when everyone
started putting money

261
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,520
in, everyone followed
as well, which

262
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,060
is very similar to
FOMO if you're missing

263
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,760
out, and it just
follows as well.

264
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,520
And more or less,
once you finally see

265
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
the pattern that
the stock price is

266
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,240
going up, a lot of
people are messing,

267
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,740
everyone jumps on it
and continues to upheld

268
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,380
and push up the
price in this case.

269
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,000
so at the end we just
uh had to do like

270
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,340
actually a true or
false test was um a

271
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,820
professor's claim that
gamestop started at

272
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,720
four cents in august
2020 correct well no

273
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,420
it wasn't the actual
price four dollars

274
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,740
per share and the
actual what happened

275
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,280
was against the theory
itself so So that

276
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,480
was basically the end

",FALSE,1,"Hello Professor, my name is Alejandro Jervis and today I'll presenting my Session 8 Assignment talking about Market Efficiency and Behavioral Finance, and then I'll walk through my Python event study simulation using the DRIVER method — Define, Reason, Inputs, Visualize, Example, and Review.
Before I begin, I want to give a quick overview of what I'll be covering today.
This session is about how markets react to information — specifically, how they behave around major news like earnings announcements.
We'll compare two big ideas: Market Efficiency, which assumes prices instantly reflect all available information, and Behavioral Finance, which shows that human psychology can cause delayed or exaggerated reactions.

To bring this to life, I'll show a short Python simulation that visualizes how a fictional stock reacts to an earnings announcement and what that tells us about efficiency
The goal of this simulation is to see how quickly prices adjust after an event.
I'll do this by running a simple Event Study using the CAPM model to estimate expected returns.
Then, I'll compare those expected returns to what actually happens when new information hits  like a positive earnings surprise.
We'll measure three things:
1.	Abnormal Return, which shows how much the price moved beyond normal expectations,
2.	Cumulative Abnormal Return, which adds up those effects over time, and
3.	The Efficiency Ratio, which tells us how much of the total reaction happened right on Day 0
To stay organized, I'll be explaining everything using the DRIVER method.
First, I'll Define the goal of the study.
Then, I'll Reason through why we compare expected versus actual returns.
Next, I'll show the Inputs — the numbers and parameters used in the code.
After that, I'll Visualize the results using a graph and a table.
Then I'll go through an Example of how to interpret those results.
Finally, I'll Review what this tells us about market efficiency and behavioral patterns.
After this intro, I'll move straight into explaining both the theory and the code
Let's start with the theory behind it.
The Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH, says that markets reflect all available information almost instantly. This means that stock prices always represent fair value based on what's known at that moment. In an efficient market, it's impossible to consistently ""beat the market,"" because as soon as new information appears, it's immediately priced in.
There are three main forms of efficiency.
Weak form means that past prices and trends are already reflected in today's price, so technical analysis can't help you. Semi-strong form means all publicly available information — like earnings announcements or news — is already priced in. Strong form says even insider information is instantly reflected, though in reality, markets rarely reach that level.
Now, on the other side, we have Behavioral Finance — which challenges the idea that investors are always rational. Instead, it looks at how psychology and human emotions affect market behavior. People make systematic mistakes — like overconfidence, herd behavior, loss aversion, or anchoring. These biases cause prices to sometimes drift away from their ""rational"" values.
A famous example is post-earnings announcement drift — where after good earnings, prices keep rising for a few days instead of jumping all at once. That's a clear sign that investors may under-react to news. Our simulation today captures that same idea.
Now I'll move to my Python code. The goal of my project is to simulate how a fictional stock called BrainWave AI reacts to an earnings announcement and measure how efficient that reaction is.

Define
The purpose of the script is to test how much of the total price reaction happens on the announcement day compared to the days after.
We simulate daily returns from Day −5 to Day +5.
Then, we calculate three key things:
Abnormal Return (AR): the difference between actual and expected return, based on CAPM. Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR): the sum of abnormal returns over time. Efficiency Ratio: how much of the total reaction happens right away on Day 0.
If most of the move happens on Day 0, that shows efficiency. If the stock keeps moving after Day 0, it suggests behavioral under-reaction.
Reason
The logic behind the setup is simple.
We use the CAPM model to estimate what the stock's return should have been, given the market's performance.
Then we compare it to the stock's actual return, which includes any surprise effects from the earnings announcement.
The difference — the abnormal return — tells us how much the event moved the price beyond normal expectations.
If the abnormal returns cluster around the announcement, the market is efficient. If they spread over several days, investors may be reacting slowly.

I — Inputs
Now let's talk about the parameters used in the simulation.
I started by setting a random seed for reproducibility — np.random.seed(1337) — so we get the same results every time we run it.
The simulation covers 11 days, from Day −5 to Day +5.
The market has a small positive average daily return of 0.06% and a volatility of about 0.9%.
Our stock, BrainWave AI, has a beta of 1.1, meaning it moves slightly more than the market.
The risk-free rate is 0.015% per day, representing short-term Treasury yields.
For the event itself, I simulate a positive earnings surprise of +3.5% on Day 0, and a small drift of +0.8% per day for Days +1, +2, and +3.
This drift represents investors slowly adjusting to the news — a realistic behavioral effect known from empirical studies.
Finally, I added a small amount of random noise to capture day-to-day company-specific movement that's unrelated to the market.

V — Visualize
After computing everything, I create a DataFrame with the simulated data and calculate:
Expected stock returns using CAPM. Actual returns including the event effects Abnormal returns (AR) = actual minus expected Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) = the running sum of abnormal returns
Then, the program prints a clear table and plots the CAR graph.
The x-axis shows days relative to the event (−5 to +5), and the y-axis shows cumulative abnormal return in percentage terms.
A red dashed line marks Day 0, the announcement day.
When the code runs, you see a sharp upward jump in CAR on Day 0 and then a continued upward slope on Days +1 to +3 — exactly what we'd expect if investors are under-reacting.

E — Example
To interpret the results: 	Before Day 0, CAR fluctuates around zero, showing no unusual movement.	On Day 0, CAR jumps upward by about 3.5%, reflecting the earnings surprise.
	After Day 0, it continues to rise slightly due to the +0.8% drift, showing post-announcement momentum.
The Efficiency Ratio, calculated as (AR on Day 0 / Total CAR), might come out around 70–80%, meaning that roughly 70–80% of the total reaction happened immediately, and the rest took place in the following days.
If we set the drift to zero, the CAR line would jump and then flatten — showing a perfectly efficient market.
If we make the drift negative after the surprise, CAR would rise and then fall — an example of over-reaction and correction.

R — Review
So what does this teach us?
The event study helps visualize how real markets process information.
An efficient market prices news instantly, while behavioral effects cause delayed or exaggerated reactions.
In our simulation, BrainWave AI showed both — a strong instant jump followed by gradual adjustment, which mirrors real-world investor behavior.
In practical research, event studies like this use actual market data over many events to test how quickly information is incorporated into prices. The code I wrote provides a simplified but powerful way to demonstrate that concept using simulated data.
In summary, market efficiency and behavioral finance represent two sides of the same coin. Efficiency assumes rational pricing, while behavioral finance reminds us that humans aren't perfect — we react emotionally, sometimes slowly or excessively.
My Python simulation of BrainWave AI's earnings announcement makes this visible: it shows how information, psychology, and timing all combine to shape real-world market behavior.
Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Hi there. So, my name is Jillian and
today I will be covering the driver
framework specifically with market
efficiency investigation. So, I'm
testing EMH, excuse me, using GameStop
short squeeze as a case study and my
very first task in driver is to verify
the facts before any analysis. So, the
statement GameStop traded at 0.04 cents
in a August 2020 is incorrect. So its
split adjusted historical data showed
that GME closed at about $167
on August 31st, 2020. And I will
communiate communicate and hopefully fix
this correction um respectfully and be
respectful to the sources that I'm
citing.
So, next,
GME's all-time trade uh high in trade
day during the event was $483 on January
8th, 2021. And some sources also note
that pre-market um quotes were slightly
above $500 that day. So, it just depends
on what source you're going by. Um and
then short interest peaked at around
140% of the float. So um which explains
the sort of mechanical possibility of
extreme squeezes via reending chains.
Then trading corrections or trading
restrictions were imposed um by Robin
Hood on January 20th to January 29th
2021.
uh it's discussed in February 18th um
the house financial services hearings at
the house um and detailed in the
testimony. So Melbourne Capital reported
a 53% loss for January 2021 and took
outside capital infusions and later the
firm closed in 2022 and then on volume
trading jumped roughly 10 million for a
pre-event to peaks near 200 million
which is a well over 10% increase. So
how I will correct the zero 04%
um claim. So for example, I might say
like, ""Professor, I verified the split
adjusted data. So GME closed at $1.67 on
August 3rd or sorry, August 31st, 2020
with the pre-split being around $6.68.
The figure $04 appears to be a misread
of split/deimal
data, which can be common. Um, and I'll
footnote the sources being Yahoo
Finance, making sure our timeline stays
precise. So moving on to R. So my plan
was that I'd have event windows being
the first um an way of an analyzing this
discrepancy in data. So our estimation
window is going to be 150 to 30 trading
days before January 13, 2021.
And our event window is going to be
January 13th to February 5th, 2021 with
sensitivity checks being January 25th to
January 29th and January 27th to fe
February 2nd. So our data um it's going
to be that we're going to include is our
daily GME prices and volume. SPY is
going to be our market proxy. So that's
our ETF measuring the S&P 500. And then
our risk-free via threemonth T bill if
available. So all else we're going to
set the RF equal to zero for ultrashort
windows. And then our model is going to
be a market model or cap mle sorry cap m
beta from estimation window. So we're
going to compute abnormal returns which
is ar compute uh during event windows
and then test any significance tests
non-parametrics etc etc. Next we're
going to compare observed reactions to
semi-strong form predictions. So the
speed and accuracy of incorporation,
check weak form uh via short horizon
predictability patterns and discuss
strong form v trading interactions and
constraints.
So moving on to event or sorry
implement. I'm going to run the code and
I'll
GME and spy data and estimate beta from
the pre-event window. I'll compute AR
and C for multiple windows. Visualize
the prices, volumes, ARs, and CS. So,
here we go.
We're going to run this. Hopefully, it
works. Um,
it's working.
Yay.
Here we go.
I'm actually so excited for this.
Hopefully it works. It's taking a while.
Here we go. Perfect.
It looks like there's an error.
So interestingly enough,
okay, this is interesting actually and
we need this. So in order to further
um improve the code that we already
have, I'm going to ask Gemini to
can you please
tr
my code and
fix
the issues present.
Let's see what it says.
This can happen and I'm honestly glad
this happened because it is gives me a
good place to sort of um step back and
improve the design a bit and evaluate
where I'm falling short.
Here we go.
It looks like key area blah blah blah.
Oh,
okay. I understand.
Accept and run. Okay, cool. That's so
helpful.
Okay,
see what's going on. It's still working.
It's still blinking.
Okay.
So, I guess while that's not working
still, the code is just tells us a
story. So really what we're trying to
get at here it that um so our weak form
so extreme momentum and reversals over
hours and days suggest that there's a
return of patterns that would not be
reliably exploitable by typical
investors because of execution frictions
holds borrow and locate constraints
trading restrictions etc etc semi-
strong form um prices that reacted to
violently to public signals. So that
could be Ryan Cohen's involvement,
social amplification, etc. And the sheer
scale and speed suggest information
processing bottlenecks and microructure
stress rather than than clean
instantaneous assimilation.
With strong form, the episode is
consistent with no guaranteed rents for
any group once constraints are included.
Many retail investors and some shorts
lost money. A few actors profited, but
systematically exploiting this ex auntie
was hard. So the bottom line is apparent
anomalies challenge the letter of EMH,
but they can potentially be reconciled
with EMH when we model these frictions
and limits to arbitrage. So my
conclusion is that this episode does not
outright fault by EMH, but it sort of
highlights the conditions. So those
conditions include concentrated source
short interests, rehypotheation,
collateral shocks and platform
restrictions under which prices can
deviate sharply and temporarily.
For investors, this implication favors
passive strategies for most contexts.
While active strategies may add value,
but they specifically understand micro
structure, borrow dynamics and
regulatory plumbing. For policy, we
suggest that we focus on transparency of
short interest, clearing house
collateral mechanics, and orderflow risk
management. Um, and that's extremely
important when we're talking about
anything related to it. Thank you so

",FALSE,1,"All right. Hello, my name is Kan and today I will be doing my management 310 session 8 assignment on the GameStop short squeeze. And I'll be using the driver framework in order to um go through this. I'll be going through a verbal explanation first and then kind of walking you through the some of the code that I use in the implementation process. And so first we're going to be defining the core question which is did the GameStop job short squeeze show that markets are inefficient or can it be kind of be taken as an anomaly and be reconciled with the efficient market hypothesis or EMH once we account for limits to arbitrage and behavioral biases. And so today we'll also be d um looking at some valid data and looking at what's valid and what are some things that have been going around that maybe are not um as well as market efficiency, rational profit opportunities and behavioral such micro micro structure biases like hurting social media dynamics and market plumbing um that would explain the price path without completely derailing the model itself. And so before I kind of go into um each financial concept in general terms, I'll be kind of defining it so that we can apply it to GameStop. And so first in the efficient market hypothesis, it says that markets incorporate the weak form of EMH, which is what I'll be referring it to as now on is that markets incorporate all past price volume price and volume information. um and it's that you can't systematically beat the market with using chart patterns, m momentum, reversal or technical analysis and that past returns can contain no exploitable predictive power once risk is accounted for. Um that's basically just saying you can't really predict the market. And then the second one would be semi- strong EMH, which is that markets incorporate all publicly available information and quickly with without bias. And it means that earnings announcements, short interest reports, analyst ratings, news, Reddit threads, those are all instantaneously reflected in prices and that there is no predictable drift or delayed reaction. And then the last one is a strong forth strong form EMH, which is that market markets incorporate all information public and private. And so it implicates that no insider or institutional investor should consistently earn abnormal returns if this is the case. And almost no one, even academics, take this sort of theory seriously. Um, an explanation of abnormal returns is that the portion of a stock's returns cannot be explained by normal risk factors such as the market, the beta, its usual volatility. Um, and the concept is that the abnormal return equals actual return minus the expected return from like the CAPM or market model that we looked at in the past. And if that abnormal return is really high, that's kind of what you're looking for. uh large repeated abnormal returns in a short window around certain information events means that there's a possible market inefficiency. And then some behavioral finance concepts uh hurting investors copy one another. Um they assume that they um the others know something. They fear of missing out. That's that FOMO aspect. And then they fear that they would be the only one who's wrong which is why hurting happens. Overconfidence. Exactly what it sounds like. They investors overestimate theirformational advantage or predictive skill. U FOMO. people chase assets with extremely skewed payoff distributions and that's also known as the lottery preference. And then narrative economics stories um it becames a coordinating device that moves capital and then there's limits to arbitrage. So even if a price is obviously wrong, rational traders may not correctly because of capital constraints, borrow availability for shorts, risk of unlimited losses, margin call short squeezes or liquidity evaporations. And then market microructure frictions are plumbing issues like clearing house collateral requirements, trading restrictions, bid as spread explosions or options gamma exposure. And these can cause large price dislocations even within fully rational investors. And so if we look at the rational investor profitability u a general explanation is that EMH allows temporary anomalies if they cannot be systematically exploited and risk adjusted returns disappear once you consider constraints. Um, so some things to ask are can investors uh design a repeatable strategy? Did X anti-information give a positive expected value? And were risks so large that abnormal profits were actually compensation for fundamental risk? And then um the event study methodology is you first identify an event date. Um, so for us it'd be like co-en stake disclosure the January 28th trading halt and then establish the estimation window before event to model normal returns and then compute abnormal returns like that actual minus expected that I kind of talked about in the equation before and then you sum the abnormal returns to compute the cumulative abnormal returns or C and large C is a possible violation of EM EMH and so today we're going to be applying all of those concepts to the GameStop timeline. So, near 2020, um they were near like bankruptcy levels, but there was this one uh statement that we were to validate and that was that in August 2020, GameStop was trading at 4 cents and that is completely false. I looked on Fidelity, Yahoo Finance, um and also just other sources that say that it was actually trading at around $1 to $2. Um it was at lowest about $1 in August 2020. And so, that statement is false. It was not 4 cents. Um however the fundamentals of GameStop were weak, revenue was declining, short sellers were dominant and then high uh short interest begins building and you should if you look at the image you would expect prices should reflect weak fundamentals and high bankruptcy risk which they did. And then in September 2020, Ryan Cohen acquires 13%. Um he's like the Chewy founder and he's a pretty credible operator and this is public information. And then there's a semi- strong em EMH expectation that price should adjust rapidly but not overreact to the news. Um and then the observed data which kind of follows this is that prices did rise gradually but not instantaneously and the cohen effect took weeks to fully reflect. Um there's a possible semi-strong inconsistency which is a delayed reaction. And then if you jump to January 2021, that's when there's a Reddit subgroup that u manually makes this stock surge to $483. Um the short interest is about $140 140% of float according to S3 partners. The retail volume increased about 10 times. The options activity created gamma squeezes and the stock surged from $20 to $483 in a very short period of time. Um, if you look at a weak form EMH violation, you would say momentum effects exploded and past price movements absolutely predicted future returns or at least short-term. And then a semi-strong EMH violation that public info, high short interest or WSB hype. Um, it took weeks or months to incorporate and that the price overshot analyst estimates by about 10 uh which were about $10 to $40. And then if you look at the strong EMH violation, hedge funds with sophisticated analytics were blown out um such as Melvin Capital which was which lost 53%. And this is evidence that markets do not absorb all information immediately or efficiently. And then if you look at um February 2021, there's congressional hearings, policy makers investigated market manipulation and broker restrictions. and then the trading volume was normalized and the volatility declined. So this is more like postmortem, but it does show that the system recognized that something unusual happens and took steps in order to kind of mitigate that anomaly that happened. Now we have a bit more stabilization. The price has reverted back to their fundamentals, the volatility and volume back to historical norms. And then Cohen later became chair which means that the business partially transformed. And then if you look at the that event the mean reversion consistent with EMH is that eventually prices do return to fundamentals but the severity of that deviation show that uh intraday or short-term prices can be wildly inefficient. So um if you look at the the test a week is basically the null hypothesis for that is that the GameStop pass prices do not allow prediction of future returns and then the reverse would be true for the um hypothesis that it g um GameStop shows momentum or reversal patterns inconsistent with weak form EMH and then um the other hypothesis for semi-strong and strong follow along the same patterns where the null hypothesis is that it is um that it follows along that specific EMH theory and then the other hypothesis is that it does not and so um the different event windows the coen stake was in September 2020 retail hype December to January peak squeeze was going to be January late January the halt and restriction on the 28th and then postevent stabilization would be February to March of that year of 20 of 2021 and then if you look at behavioral drivers. There was definitely hurting on social media that was present, overconfidence and FOMO. Um narratives as price catalyst, retail option buying u leading to a gammon squeeze and then arbitrage arbitrage limits. And so um if we look at everything the um if if you look at the um abnormal returns and event behaviors, we can see that um there was definitely some some uh there was like no predictability to this event which makes it absolutely abnormal. But if we look at other kind of behavioral biases, we kind of had to question whether this is a fundamental market failure or if this is um simply a a normal kind of anomaly of the market. And so um some like key takeaways from this is that the EMH works reasonably well in normal conditions but it breaks under extreme coordination and platform driven sentiment and behavioral dynamics are now essential for understanding price formation. Uh clearing and collateral mechanisms can drive price action more than fundamentals and regulatory frameworks need to consider transparency for short interest broker collateral requirements and the role of social media. Um, now I am going to show um a little script that I use collab in order to write. Um, and I'll just kind of be like walking through what that does. All right. All right. So if you can see my screen um first the notebook is going to import standard finance and data analysis libraries and download historical price for both GameStop and the S&P 500 proxy s and spy from August 2020 through mid 2021 which is that event window I was talking about. That is going to give us all the inputs we need to analyze the price levels trading volume and market broad market movements. and that's going to establish the foundation for checking whether or not GameStop's behavior align with what we would expect. Next, we're going to do a price analysis. And so, here we have the um the notebook is going to plot the GameStop's adjusted closing price over time. And it's going to create a visualization that shows the massive runup to the $483 peak followed by the collapse. And it's going to allow us to connect those price movements to the timeline of events. And then um you're going to see that market efficiency would normally imply smoother fundamentals uh fundamental acred pricing. And so a visualization of this would definitely not show that and it would have extreme deviations. And then from there the notebook is going to convert those raw prices into um daily raw log returns. And so, um, the returns are the basic unit of market efficiency testing, and we're going to use them to see whether or not GameStop earned abnormal returns that can't be explained by normal market risk. And then there's going to have a um estimation window and CAPM regression. And so, it's going to select a pre-event estimation window and then fit a simple CAPM style regression of GameStop's returns on SPY's returns. And so conceptually, this regression estimates um what GameStop's normal behavior would have been based on how sensitive it is to the market and what would have been expected on a typical day. And if markets were efficient, actual returns during this event would line up with the expected returns. And then uh we're going to look at the um so like using that regression you would see the expected returns the abnormal returns which is actual minus expected and then the cumulative abnormal returns which is just all of that added up and then it would complete a volume analysis here um which is going to plot the trading volume and a normalized volume measure. So, it's going to be comparing volume during the squeeze to pre-event norms. And the retail volume jumps more than 10 times. I'm just now realizing that I may not be sharing my screen. Um, which no, I am. My apologies. Um, not sure why I didn't think I was sharing for a second. And you're going to see that retail volume is going to jump more than 10 times. And you can align that with behavioral explanations such as hurting, FOMO, NATO driven trading, and social coordinations. So if you put it all together, um you can say prices deviated massively from levels justified by risk or fundamentals. There were abnormal returns during the squeeze which were enormous. Volume patterns highlight powerful behavioral dynamics and CAPM based expected returns completely failed during the event. This suggests for weak form EMH it failed due to extreme momentum and predictable reversals. The semi-strong EMH failed because there was public information that was not incorporated efficiently and behavioral finance plus limits to arbitrage best explain the price dynamics. Um those are the takeaways from the script. Thank you.",,0,1

This is going to be a long one, but we are now into session 8, and I appreciate how we're not just doing the same thing every single week. Like, now we have a case study in this course, and I find that very interesting. So, we're going to go ahead and get started.

We are investigating the market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020-21 as a case study. We need to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to the efficient market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency if we explain within existing frameworks. The critical first step is to verify the statement, GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020, against actual historical data.

And so we'll just jump right into it. That answer is no, according to historical stock data. This first chart is just a breakdown of the actual accurate figures in the correct time zone, or time frame.

So you can see August 2020, which is what we were told to investigate, the price range is actually $1.04 to even $1.67, so much, much higher. And then just also for some background information, it was fairly low on August 3rd and August 7th, kind of like in the beginning of the month at $1.04, and then it was highest at the very end of the month at $1.67. So here I have a lot of information. The dramatic GameStop short squeeze event unfolded primarily in January of 2021.

It represents a profound challenge to the fundamental tenets of modern financial economics, particularly that efficient market hypothesis, which we're going to get into. This report investigates the price behavior of the GameStop during this period, comparing it against the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or just EMH. I mean, GameStop will just be GME, or I'll just keep GameStop.

It compares against the EMH predictions and assesses the role of both market microstructure and behavioral finance in generating extreme market anomalies. The analysis confirms that the GME short squeeze violated multiple forms of market efficiency. The rapid non-random price escalation contradicts the assumption of a weak form EMH.

Furthermore, the sustaining massive divergence between the market price, which peaks near $483 per share, and the underlying fundamental valuation estimated to be well below $20 by institutional analysts, which constituted a clear rejection of the semi-strong form EMH. So, huge jump there. Crucially, the episode demonstrated the catastrophic failure of traditional market mechanisms, specifically arbitrage, to correct mispricing.

Rationally, fundamentally focused short sellers suffered non-systematic losses exceeding $6 billion globally, with major funds like Melvin Capital losing 53% of their capital in just January 2021 alone. This inability to restore equilibrium was due to severe market frictions collectively defined by the Theory of Limits to Arbitrage, including noise-sharer risks and structural constraints, leading to extreme short interest, which reached up to 140% of the total. Ultimately, the GameStop phenomenon is best understood through a synthesized framework incorporating behavioral finance, which is explaining the initiation and persistence of the price bubble through mechanisms like herding and coordinated speculation.

And along with behavioral finance, market microstructure analysis, which is explaining the dramatic climax in sudden intervention caused by outdated clearing and settlement bottlenecks. This event stands as a compelling case study of market fragility when speculative coordination meets acute structural vulnerability. The next section of this case study is the Factual Verification and Event Chronology, or our represent stage in the driver framework, still applying that to this case study.

I first want to get into the correction of historical price data in the QEKP strategy. A critical prerequisite for really any rigorous financial analysis is the accurate verification of historical market data. We have talked about this a little bit before and how that statement is incorrect, but I do want to go into how relying on verified market data from the period, the price of GME stock in mid-2020 prior to the major catalyst was very, very high, with research indicating closing prices in the vicinity of $7.47 per share, which if you remember, in August 2020, it was $1.04 to $1.67. And now we can get into the pre-squeeze fundamentals and market sentiment.

Before the short squeeze was commenced in early 2021, GameStop was widely viewed by institutional investors as a failing entity. The company's core business model, which is a brick-and-mortar video game retail source, was rapidly deteriorating due to the broader shift towards digital distribution of games. There's PS4s and YouTube. 

What's the need for GameStop anymore? The financial results reflected this negative outlook. The company reported very poor financial performance throughout 2020, including negative earnings during the second and the third quarters. Key fundamental valuation metrics were alarming.

For the calendar year 2020, GME exhibited a profoundly negative earnings yield of negative 22.8%. Reflecting this pervasive pessimism, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly rated the stock as sell, with price targets set consistently low, such as $13.50 or even $10, confirming the institutional belief that the stock was fundamentally overvalued even at mid-single-digit prices. This collective analysis set the stage for aggressive short positioning. The catalyst and squeeze timeline, to talk about that timeline a little bit, the market dynamics began to shift in late 2020, initiating the events that culminated in the short squeeze.

Some initial signs and extreme shortings, a significant initial sign, occurred in September 2020, when activist investor Ryan Cohen, through RC Ventures, gained an equity stake and secured a board seat. Cohen's involvement, leveraging his background in online retailing, introduced a potential narrative of corporate turnaround. This news was publicly available information, testing the semi-strong EMH.

However, institutional short sellers, focusing on immediate negative fundamentals, largely disregarded this signal. Viewing the subsequent stock price increase as an unwarranted overvaluation that presented an ideal opportunity for shorting. This dynamic revealed a critical phenomenon.

The initial activist investment served not as a rational price stabilizer of equal value, but as a credible narrative anchor for the advance that retail investors would face. This provided a pretext for fundamentally speculative buying, transforming what was intended as a signal value into a volatility play. The institutional shorts continued their aggressive positioning, leading to a profound structural vulnerability.

By January 22, 2021, GameStop had become the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S. market, with short interest reaching a paradoxical and unprecedented peak of approximately 140% of the free float. This condition, where the number of shorted shares exceeds the shares available for trading due to relending practices, exposed a critical structural weakness. The existence of a short interest rate yield exceeding 100% meant the supply of shares required to cover existing short positions was theoretically impossible to meet, creating infinite short squeeze potential.

This was not merely high risk. It was systematic market friction that fundamentally violated the efficient market assumption of continuous liquidity and unlimited arbitrage capital. The resulting price explosion was a function of forced liquidation rather than a consensus on valuation.

Now we're going to get into the climax in intervention. The active squeeze commenced around January 13, 2021, driven by coordinated purchasing efforts orchestrated by retail investors using social media platforms, particularly the Reddit-slash-WallStreetBets forum. This collective action initiated a momentum feedback loop.

Retail buying drove the price up, which triggered margin calls per short sellers, forcing them to buy back shares, which further accelerated the price spike. The climax occurred on January 28, 2021, with GameStop reaching a high of approximately $483. This volatility resulted in massive losses for hedge funds, Melvin Capital, for instance, again, he lost 43% of its investments that month alone and required a bailout from Citadel in 0.72. The squeeze was abruptly halted when several brokerages, most notably Robinhood, restricted the buying of GameStop and a few other volatile stocks while still permitting the selling of existing positions.

This asymmetrical intervention immediately triggered a sharp retreat from the peak price. This table below summarizes the critical data points during this period. I apologize, I just realized that my recording paused and now I do not remember where to pick back up on, so I'm going to quickly go over the very ending of that climax and intervention and talk about that chart again.

I really hope that we did already go over this and I'd rather cover something again rather than completely skip it. So this is just a table that summarizes the critical data points during the period of August 2020 to January 2021, which was that GameStop peak price and short interest data. And then now we're going into the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Theoretical Framework and Testable Implications, or AKA, implement in our driver framework.

To review the EMH form and assumptions, I know we talked about it a little bit, like we defined it, we talked a little bit about its distinct forms, but I want to talk about the history a little bit. It is primarily attributed to economist Eugene Fama, who says that security prices reflect all available information, implying that assets trade at their fair value and that it is practically impossible to consistently outperform the market. The theory rests on the assumption of rational investors and free instantaneous flow of information.

And so, again, as you can see on my document, I have the three distinct forms based on the scope of information incorporated into the price. I'm not going to go too into detail with that for the sake of time and the fact that we talked about them a little bit. But the three forms are the weak form EMH, the semi-strong form and the strong form.

All right, so now we're going to get to the criteria for a violation of EMH. Testing the EMH involves defining and calculating abnormal return, or AR. An abnormal return is the difference between the security's actual return over a specified period and its expected normal return if the conditioning event had not occurred.

The normal return is typically estimated using market-based models, such as the market model, which assumes a stable linear relationship between the security return and the overall market return. If a defined strategy, such as technical analysis, which we'll get into a little bit, fundamental analysis, or trading based on private information, systematically generates positive abnormal returns greater than the cost of capital and transaction costs over a long period, the relevant form of the EMH is rejected. So there's that criteria.

And now we're going to get into the quantitative assessment of EMH violations in the GameStop event. So kind of applying that to our actual case study. We're going to first test for weak form efficiency, which goes into the technical analysis.

The weak form EMH suggests that price movements should follow a random walk, meaning that past price patterns are irrelevant for predicting future returns. The GME short squeeze provides the GameStop stock price experienced an extreme rapid and sustained ascent, surging from approximately $20 per share on January 13, 2020, to its peak near $483. This movement was clearly momentum driven, fueled by collective action rather than a random series of independent trades.

Research analyzing the event found that the returns of GME were closely coordinated with the positive sentiment and tone of the discussions occurring on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. This correlation implies that investors who are monitoring the social media sentiment, a non-traditional but exploitable informational signal, could have systematically capitalized on the coordinated buying pressure for a defined event window. The price movement was therefore non-random and predictable based on these external coordination signals.

Additionally, during the high validity phase, January to February 2021, GME returns exhibited as unusual, sharply negative correlated with the broader market. This suggests that GME's movement was highly idiosyncratic and driven by specific internal pressures, the squeeze, rather than general market factors, further supporting the idea that its price pack was technically exploitable. The persistence of this explosive momentum resulting in massive profits for early buyers strongly suggests that the weak form EMH was violated.

Now we're going to test for semi-strong form efficiency, the fundamental analysis. The semi-strong EMH demands that public information such as a company's financial health, the business model's decline, and the consistency of analyst price targets is immediately and accurately reflected in the stock price. So observe behavior and violation. 

The GameStop event presents a stark failure of the semi-strong form. At the height of the squeeze, the stock traded near $400 million per share, representing a valuation that bore no relationship to the publicly known fundamental health of the business. Publicly available financial data showed deteriorating revenues and losses.

Institutional and analysts maintained sell ratings with price targets of $10 to $13.50. The massive discrepancy between the consensus, fundamental value, and the market price persisted for weeks. Even after the initial collapse of the peak, the price remained substantially elevated compared to the pre-squeeze level as late as mid-May 2021. The market price explicitly rejected decades of accumulated public financial information, demonstrating that the price was determined almost entirely by technical supply and demand mechanics, the squeeze, and behavioral coordination, rather than by public fundamental information.

The sheer magnitude and duration of this mispricing, which traditional arbitrators could not correct, constitutes a conclusive violation. The semi-strong form EMH was clearly violated. Lastly, we're going to test for that strong form efficiency, which is that insider or private information.

So, it is considered the most stringent and least likely to hold in reality, but the GME event introduced a new dimension related to microstructure information. The squeeze was halted not by a fundamental news release, but by an operational decision of brokerages like Robinhood to restrict borrowing. The decision was predicted on the urgent need to meet billions of dollars in collateral requirements imposed by the clearinghouse, DTCC, due to high volatility and settlement risk.

While Robinhood publicly cited only market volatility in its initial communication, considering the critical financial necessity, the clearinghouse crisis itself constituted highly sensitive non-public operational information. Market participants who were intimately connected to the liquidity or capital flows within the clearing system, or who were monitoring the rapidly escalating margin requirements in real time, would have possessed a severe informational advantage regarding the imminence of the trading restrictions. Given that firms like Citadel, a major market maker for Robinhood, injected capital into the heavily shorted Melvin Capital and were privy to massive amounts of order flow data, the possibility exists that information regarding the impending systematic liquidity crunch, which triggered the trading halt, could have been exploited.

If sophisticated participants traded based on proprietary intelligence regarding margin stress and impending regulatory or operational intervention prior to the public announcement of restrictions on January 28, 2021, they would have achieved a systematic advantage based on non-public microstructure friction intelligence. So this scenario suggests that the strong foreign image was plausibly violated. Next we're going to move on to the rationality and systematic profitability, or our validate stage of the German framework.

We're getting into the arbitrage challenge. The core assumption of the EMH is that rational investors, upon observing a mispricing, will instantly act to capitalize on the inefficiency. In the GME case, the rational trade dictated short selling to profit from the anticipated correction back towards fundamental value.

The hedge funds engaging in massive short positions were initially acting as rational arbiters. Now we're going to go on to the theory of limits to arbitrage. The GME event, however, provides a textbook example of the failure of arbitrage due to real world impediments supporting the theory of limits to arbitrage.

This theory explains why rational actors cannot always instantaneously correct egregious mispricing. There is a noise trader risk, so the primary limitation faced by short sellers was this noise trader risk, meaning that the riskless irrational or speculative investors, the retail crowd or coordinating of social media, would continue to drive the price further away from its fundamental value, resulting in sustained losses for the rational arbitrer. Hedge funds found that the physiological momentum and collective buying power overwhelmed their short selling capacity, forcing them to purchase shares at exorbitant prices to meet margin costs, thus transforming their conviction into catastrophic losses.

The traditional EMH definition of rationality fails when faced with the risk of overwhelmingly coordinated irrationality. The second limit was rooted in the microstructure of frictions and capital constraints. The exceptional short interest ratio of 140% meant that the market for borrowing shares was severely constrained and highly expensive, effectively capping the influx of arbitrage capital, or that selling pressure, required to deflate the bubble.

Now we're going to talk about the evaluation of systemic profitability. The outcome confirms that the GME anomaly did not offer systematic risk-adjusted profit opportunities for investors attempting to restore efficiency. The rational short sellers who had correctly identified fundamental misvaluation incurred billions of dollars in non-diversible losses, demonstrating that the necessary arbitrage capital was overwhelmed by the combination of noise-triggered momentum and institutional constraints.

The GME short squeeze demonstrates a crucial feedback loop. The fundamental weakness of GME, when exploited via aggressive shorting, created the conditions for an acute microstructure weakness, the extreme short ratio. This structural vulnerability then allowed behavioral coordination to detach the price from reality, resulting in a market structure failure rather than a conventional fundamental anomaly.

When arbitrage shares lose 53% of their capital, the AMH framework of price correction based on rationality is rendered inapplicable for describing the event. We are nearing the end, but the market microstructure failures and policy implications are evolved. We are first going to talk about the clearinghouse bottleneck in capital requirements.

The decisive factor that terminated the GME squeeze was a profound failure in market microstructure. In U.S. markets, trades typically settle two days after execution. During periods of extreme volatility, central clearinghouses, such as the DTCC, required brokerages to post massive collateral margin instantly to mitigate the risk of a counterparty defaulting between trade execution and final settlement.

As GME's volatility exploded, Robinhood faced billions of dollars in immediate unforeseen collateral demands. This liquidity crisis forced Robinhood to restrict buying in GME and other new stocks to manage its capital requirements. This decision, stemming from the inability of the existing T-plus-2 system to effectively handle rapid changes in risk, acted as a structural lever that halted the speculative momentum.

The impact of trading restrictions and transparency The subsequent asymmetrical trading restriction, allowing selling but blocking buying, introduced immediate downward pressure on GME stock prices, contributing significantly to their retreat from the January 28th peak. The controversy was compounded by a transparency failure. Congressional testimony revealed that Robinhood initially attributed the restriction solely to market volatility, omitting the vital financial requirement issues with the clearinghouse.

This lack of candor exacerbated the public perception that the market system was rigged against the retail investor. The intervention highlights that market efficiency can be structurally determined by clearing infrastructure. The GME event shifted regulatory focus toward the underlying mechanisms of settlement.

The congressional hearings examined market volatility and the institutional practices involved, focusing on the potential for accelerating settlement processes through the Project ION, for example, as a means of mitigating systemic risk and limiting the formation of volatility bubbles. The GME episode therefore dictates a regulatory imperative to modernize the settlement infrastructure, recognizing that outdated market friction can be the single greatest source of market inefficiency during crises. Behavioral Finance Explanations The Psychology of the Anomaly Behavioral Finance, or BFA, provides the most compelling explanatory framework for the interpretation and persistence of the GME price anomaly.

The BFA departs from the image by recognizing that investors are not perfectly rational, but are instead influenced by physiological factors and cognitive biases, which can lead to persistent market inefficiencies. The primary behavioral mechanism driving the GME squeeze was coordinating herding mentality. The subreddit r.wallstreetbets enabled decentralized yet organized collective action among a massive, diffused group of retail traders, a feat previously considered impossible.

Herding occurs when investors disregard their own analysis and mimic the actions of a larger group. Often believing the crowd possesses superior informational asymmetry, this collective action was amplified by influentials, a minority of very active users whose positive discourse on the forum correlated strongly with positive GME returns. This dynamic created a powerful psychological momentum, fueled by the fear of missing out, FOMO, and the desire to conform, which inflated the asset price far beyond its intrinsic value, leading to the bubble.

The fact that the trading itself was viewed by some as a giant video game underscores the gamification of investing. The low-friction, zero-commission platforms combined with the social, meme-driven coordination fostered an environment where the goal shifted from maximizing risk-adjusted returns to achieving a collective social victory against institutional short-sellers. This lowered the physiological threshold for risk, providing a powerful persistent source of irrationality that overwhelmed fundamental constraints.

Now I'm going to go into the cognitive and emotional biases in GME. There are several specific behavioral biases contributed to the GME event. Behavioral biases and market participant impact during squeeze, that hurting mentality, a loss aversion, and a position effect in confirmation bias.

The extreme losses suffered by short-sellers, as seen in the 53% drop experienced by Melvin Capital, were exasperated by loss aversion. Despite the rational fundamental analysis indicating massive overvaluation, the hedge fund's inability to close their positions quickly enough due to either capital constraints or psychological reluctance to realize losses turned a fundamental mispricing correction attempt into a catastrophic loss event. EFA, when combined with the limits to arbitrage theory, offers a comprehensive explanation for why the rational market forces failed to correct the mispricing against coordinated physiological momentum.

Finally, conclusion. Re-evaluating market efficiency in the digital age, or reflecting in that driver framework, the GameStop short squeeze provides compelling empirical evidence that financial markets, particularly in the context of extreme volatility and digitally coordinated speculation, can deviate massively and persistently from efficiency. The event mandates a shift from relying solely on the theoretical purity of the EMH toward integrated models that account for both behavioral drivers and market microstructure constraints.

Again, to go over the synthesis of our findings with each of the three levels of our EMH, that weak-form EMH violated by the existence of exploitable momentum and non-random price correlation driven by social media coordination. For that semi-strong-form EMH, it was violated by the persistent, massive detachment of market price from all verifiable public fundamental valuation metrics. And finally, that strong-form EMH is plausibly violated by inflammation asymmetry pertaining to critical non-public microstructure data that clearinghouse capital requirements that govern the trading restrictions.

So, re-validating behavioral finance and limits to arbitrage. The EMH, which assumes rational behavior and unlimited arbitrage capital, fails fundamentally in the GME case. The observed anomaly validates the core tenets of behavioral finance, demonstrating that coordinated cognitive biases hurting in confirmation bias can generate significant sustained price bubbles.

Furthermore, the GME event serves as the definitive modern case study for the limits to arbitrage, illustrating that noise trader risk, coupled with acute structural constraints of the 140% ratio and mandatory VR limits, can incapacitate rational arbitrage, allowing mispricing to persist and intensify to catastrophic levels. Market Efficiency Going Forward The GME short squeeze has permanently altered the landscape of market efficiency analysis. It underscores that market efficiency is not a continuous state.

The outcome confirms that the GME anomaly did not offer systematic, risk-adjusted profit opportunities for investors attempting to restore efficiency. The rational short sellers, who had correctly identified the fundamental misvaluation, incurred billions of dollars in non-diversifiable losses, demonstrating that the necessary arbitrage capital was overwhelmed by the combination of noise trader momentum and institutional constraints.1
The GME short squeeze demonstrates a crucial feedback loop: the fundamental weakness of GME, when exploited via aggressive shorting, created the conditions for an acute microstructure weakness (the extreme short ratio). This structural vulnerability then allowed behavioral coordination to detach the price from reality, resulting in a market structure failure rather than a conventional fundamental anomaly. When arbitrageurs lose 53% of their capital, the EMH framework of price correction based on rationality is rendered inapplicable for describing the event.
VI. Market Microstructure Failures and Policy Implications- Evolve
A. The Clearinghouse Bottleneck and Capital Requirements
The decisive factor that terminated the GME squeeze was a profound failure in market microstructure: the archaic T+2 settlement system. In US markets, trades typically settle two days after execution. During periods of extreme volatility, central clearinghouses, such as the DTCC, require brokerages to post massive collateral (margin) instantly to mitigate the risk of a counterparty defaulting between trade execution and final settlement.5
As GME's volatility exploded, Robinhood faced billions of dollars in immediate, unforeseen collateral demands. This liquidity crisis forced Robinhood to restrict buying in GME and other ""meme stocks"" to manage its capital requirements.5 This decision, stemming from the inability of the existing T+2 system to efficiently handle rapid changes in risk, acted as the structural lever that halted the speculative momentum.
B. Impact of Trading Restrictions and Transparency
The subsequent asymmetrical trading restriction—allowing selling but blocking buying—introduced immediate, downward pressure on GME's stock price, contributing significantly to the retreat from the January 28 peak.4
The controversy was compounded by a transparency failure. Congressional testimony revealed that Robinhood initially attributed the restriction solely to ""market volatility,"" omitting the vital financial requirement issues with the clearinghouse.5 This lack of candor exacerbated the public perception that the market system was ""rigged"" against the retail investor.4
The intervention highlights that market efficiency can be structurally determined by clearing infrastructure. The GME event shifted regulatory focus toward the underlying mechanisms of settlement. The Congressional hearings examined market volatility and the institutional practices involved, focusing on the potential for accelerating settlement processes (e.g., through Project Ion) as a means of mitigating systemic risk and limiting the formation of volatility bubbles.5 The GME episode therefore dictates a regulatory imperative to modernize the settlement infrastructure, recognizing that outdated market friction can be the single greatest source of market inefficiency during crises.
VII. Behavioral Finance Explanations: The Psychology of the Anomaly
A. Behavioral Finance Framework

Behavioral Finance (BFA) provides the most compelling explanatory framework for the initiation and persistence of the GME price anomaly. BFA departs from EMH by recognizing that investors are not perfectly rational but are instead influenced by psychological factors and cognitive biases, which can lead to persistent market inefficiencies.6

B. Coordination and Herding Mentality

The primary behavioral mechanism driving the GME squeeze was coordinated herding mentality.21 The subreddit r/WallStreetBets enabled decentralized, yet organized, collective action among a massive, diffuse group of retail traders, a feat previously considered impossible.4
Herding occurs when investors disregard their own analysis and mimic the actions of the larger group, often believing the crowd possesses superior information (informational asymmetry).21 This collective action was amplified by ""influentials""—a minority of very active users whose positive discourse on the forum correlated strongly with positive GME returns.18 This dynamic created a powerful psychological momentum, fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the desire to conform, which inflated the asset price far beyond its intrinsic value, leading to the bubble.21
The fact that the trading itself was viewed by some as ""a giant video game"" 5 underscores the gamification of investing. The low-friction, zero-commission platforms, combined with the social, meme-driven coordination, fostered an environment where the goal shifted from maximizing risk-adjusted return to achieving a collective social victory against institutional short sellers. This lowered the psychological threshold for risk, providing a powerful, persistent source of irrationality that overwhelmed the fundamental constraints.

Cognitive and Emotional Biases in GME
Several specific behavioral biases contributed to the GME event:
The extreme losses suffered by short sellers, as seen in the 53% drop experienced by Melvin Capital, were exacerbated by loss aversion.1 Despite their rational fundamental analysis indicating massive overvaluation, the hedge funds' inability to close their positions quickly enough—due to either capital constraints or a psychological reluctance to realize losses—turned a fundamental mispricing correction attempt into a catastrophic loss event.22 BFA, when combined with the Limits to Arbitrage theory, offers a comprehensive explanation for why the rational market forces failed to correct the mispricing against coordinated psychological momentum.

VIII. Conclusion: Reevaluating Market Efficiency in the Digital Age- Reflect

The GameStop short squeeze provides ",,,
ompelling empirical evidence that financial markets, particularly in the context of extreme volatility and digitally coordinated speculation, can deviate massively and persistently from efficiency. The event mandates a shift from relying solely on the theoretical purity of the EMH toward integrated models that account for both behavioral drivers and market microstructure constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Synthesis of Findings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The analysis confirms a multi-layered failure of informational efficiency:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weak Form EMH: Violated by the existence of exploitable momentum and non-random price correlation driven by social media coordination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Semi-Strong Form EMH: Violated by the persistent, massive detachment of market price from all verifiable public fundamental valuation metrics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strong Form EMH: Plausibly violated by information asymmetry pertaining to critical, non-public microstructure data (clearinghouse capital requirements) that governed the trading restrictions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Revalidating Behavioral Finance and Limits to Arbitrage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The EMH, which assumes rational behavior and unlimited arbitrage capital, failed fundamentally in the GME case. The observed anomaly validates the core tenets of Behavioral Finance, demonstrating that coordinated cognitive biases (herding and confirmation bias) can generate significant, sustained price bubbles. Furthermore, the GME event serves as the definitive modern case study for the Limits to Arbitrage, illustrating that noise trader risk, coupled with acute structural constraints like the 140% short ratio and mandatory VaR limits, can incapacitate rational arbitrageurs, allowing mispricing to persist and intensify to catastrophic levels.,,,,,,,,
Market Efficiency Going Forward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GME short squeeze has permanently altered the landscape of market efficiency analysis. It underscores that market efficiency is not a continuous state but a function of the underlying market structure and the psychological environment. The event necessitates the integration of non-traditional data (such as social media sentiment) into risk and valuation models and reinforces the urgency of modernizing market infrastructure to mitigate systemic risks associated with settlement delays. While markets may operate efficiently in normal informational environments, GME demonstrated that when behavioral and structural pressures align, capital markets are dangerously fragile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Works Cited, feel free to check out my documents to see my 22 sources used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I almost forgot to go over my coding part. So here is the code. As you can see we have a simulated data definition based on the GME context. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The data is simulated based on the narrative that GMA was volatile but low value in 2020 and then skyrocketed. So you can see that the estimation days is that panda of the date range with the specific ends and the periods and the frequencies and all of this is going through the coding. Second part we have an estimate normal performance model which is that market model that we talked about. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're calculating the abnormal returns in the event window and what this is telling us and what we're given of obviously like the report results and the EMH conclusion but this code executes the quantitative process required to evaluate the semi-strong form in the efficient market hypothesis or EMH as abnormal returns are typically tested using publicly available price data. So the estimation of the normal return is the foundational step in estimating how GameStop stock price should have been moved under normal circumstances. I know we talked about the abnormal return a little bit and also the EMH violation so yep this was session eight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the first thing that I did to start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this uh case study was I let uh was I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prompted uh my AI. So first I said I let,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it know that I'm an accounting student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conducting a case study on market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency and investigation. Please act,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a finance professional with a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understanding of Python and apply the uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep it simple stupid principle to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
code. I let it know the assignment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overview. So, I just copy and pasted the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assignment overview into the prompt to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of let it know like what uh I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wanted to do with it and so I had all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the information necessary uh to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
successfully complete this case study.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um I let it know all the requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the specific requirements that uh that I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was shown in the book and I let it know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that I wanted it to be complete under,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the driver framework. Um obviously this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is what this class is all built around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I wanted to be sure that I let it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
know uh what I wanted this whole case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
study built around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So for the define and discover stage uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so I just wanted to let it know. So our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
objective is to analyze the GameStop uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short squeeze event from 2020 to 2021 to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
test the theories of market efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will use specific data points in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event timeline uh provided to evaluate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the efficient market hypothesis EMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
versus behavioral finance explanations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The critical first step is to address,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the critical the critical first step in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your assignment verifying the statement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop traded at 4 cents uh in August,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020. This is a crucial crucial data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrity check before any other further,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis can be trusted. The represent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stage and here's our analytical approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or route overview. So data acquisition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or or implement we will first use a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple Python script applying the keep a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple stupid principle to pull,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop's actual historical price data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from a reliable source focusing on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020 to 2021 period. The second is the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fact validation. We will immediately use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this data to validate or correct the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
four cents in August 2020 claim. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
third is the core analysis. Once data uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once the data is verified, we will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
execute the five required analysis step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is to test which form of EMH was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
violated, evaluate rational investor uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
profitability, compare EMH predictions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to the observed price uh price volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavior and assess the behavioral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finance explanations for the uh an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anomalies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fourth step is refinement. We will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suggest next steps for a deeper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technical analysis such as calculating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal returns and correlating volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with uh social media activity. And the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fifth is the conclusion. Uh we're going,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to reflect we're going to summarize the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
findings focusing on the theoretical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imple implications for EMH and market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regulation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So applying the keep a simple stupid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
principle uh we don't need any complex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
setup. So in Python we can use the uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finance library to get a clean simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
access uh to historical stock data. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's all the code that is spit out. I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will go over it in collab a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
later. So validating. So we're running,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the implementation script gives us uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our validation results. So data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
verification and correction. This is our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
critical first step. So the statement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop traded at 4 cents in August,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020 is factually incorrect actual data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
based on the search results in Python,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
script which pulls split adjusted data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lowest trading uh price for GameStop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in August 2020 was approximately $14 on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
August 3rd 2020 not 4 cents. The stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
traded between $14 and $167 during that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
month. The 4 cents figure is off by a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factor of over 25. It may be a typo uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which which would have been the uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pre-split adjusted price at the time or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a misunderstanding of the data uh for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your professor. You should state so my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis of um my analysis of historical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data indicates a discrepancy of the 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cents price point uh for August 2020. Uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
verifiable of the split adjusted the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
split adjusted data shows that the low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for that month was $14. and I will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
proceed with the analysis using the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corrected verifiable data. The $483 peak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in January 2021 is correct. Uh and our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
script confirms that it was $483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So now we're going to test uh we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doing the test of market efficiency in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our AMH forms. So the weak form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency uh is clearly violated. This,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form states that the past price and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volume data cannot be used to predict,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
future prices. The entire uh Wall or the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
entire Reddit uh Wall Street page thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was based on uh analyzing past data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
identifying high short interest and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price trends to execute a squeeze. Uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the success of the strategy, however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brief, violates weak form efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Semi-rong form efficiency is also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly violated. This form states all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
publicly available information is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
already reflected in the price. The key,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data points um 140% short interest Ryan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cohen's buyin were public for months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet the price remained near 1 to4 dollar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
split adjusted. This this information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was not incorporated until a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non-traditional group retail traders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forced it to be. And strong form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency is also violated because this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this form uh which includes all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
private info is by definition violated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the strong uh semi- strong form is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So now we're going to do an evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of rational investor profit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
profitability. So a systematic profit um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no expost looking back it seems like an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obvious win but Xante before it happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh it was not a systematic opportunity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a high-risisk binary gamble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamble and risk risk adjusted returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the risk adjusted returns were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non-existent. Uh this was pure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speculation. The risk or volatility was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
astronomical. A rational investor could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not have systematically profited. They,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would have been right for the wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasons, gambling uh not analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And now we're going to do our comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of EMH predictions versus observed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavior. So the EMH for the EMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prediction. The 140% short interest uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have been seen by rational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
investors as a mispricing leading to a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gradual correction. The price should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
follow a random walk. Observe behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the price only corrected or it kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of went upwards when a coordinated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non-institutional force acted. The,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavior was driven by hurting and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
social media, not a rational uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dissemination of new information. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally, our assessment of behavioral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finance uh explanations. This event is a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
textbook case uh for behavioral finance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavioral. So for behavioral biases or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hurting uh is a confirmation bias and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over and overconfidence limited limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to arbitrage. So this is the most uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the most critical concept. EMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumes rational investors can always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arbitrage uh away mispricing. But here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but here risk or shorting GME uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop was impossible. 140% short.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Going long was astronomically risky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cost borrowing fees for shorts were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
massive in a micro structure. Robin Hood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and other brokers halted trading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
creating a literal limit to arbitrage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and preventing the market from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
functioning. Melbourne Capital's losses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
show uh show that staying solvent longer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
than the market stays irrational and is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a real world limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To improve this analysis, we can involve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the simple Python script. So first we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can do abnormal returns. We could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculate the abnormal returns by of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop by running a simple regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
against a market index like the S&P 500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or gaming ETF. This would statistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prove how abnormal the returns were. We,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could also do a volume analysis and we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could do this by scraping data uh from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reddit, Twitter or any uh social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
platform to correlate spikes in GameStop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trading volume with specific uh Wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Street uh Reddit posts or tweets from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
key figures demonstrating the direct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impact of social media hurting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the third is microructure analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we could do a deeper dive and this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would analyze the bid ask spread during,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the uh peak and payment for order flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the PFO. uh data that was central to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the subsequent congressional hearings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And finally, our analysis centered on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the corrected data provided provides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clear reflections on market efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the key takeaway is is games the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GameStop event does not disprove the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient market hypothesis as a useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
framework, but it provided provides a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worldclass example of its limitations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a perfect case study in a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavioral finance and most importantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limits to arbitrage. So for EMH versus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavioral, the market is efficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until it's not. Behavioral factors uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
including hurting and bias can do can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and do create massive temporary uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dislocations especially when the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rational arbitrators are constrained by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk, cost or market structure failures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and implications. So we have active,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
versus passive. Um this event does not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prove active management works or no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
traditional fund manager predicted this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It simply shows that the market can be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildly irrational. And finally, policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The event directly uh led to policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discussions in congressional hearings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about the gamification of investing, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
role of retail brokers, and the risks of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PFO, proving its significance beyond,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a theoretical anomaly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And finally, here's my code uh from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Python. So, first, it's ensuring that I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the library installed like the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finance library that I mentioned u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty early on. It's then defining the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ticker and the date range. So the ticker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is obviously uh GameStop stock. The,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start date is from January 1st, 2020 and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the end date is from March 1st,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right here, it's fetching the historic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
historical data which came up with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh $14 for uh trade price. Uh critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
step, it's checking the 2020 prices and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
filtering the data for August 2020. Um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then we're finding the lowest price in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
August 2020. uh we check the low column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the minimum value here. It's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
printing the fighting. So it's like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pasting it's f it's uh fetching what it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",FALSE,1,"Hi. Uh this is my session 8 assignment for management 310. So first we'll go through the assignment and what we need to analyze. We'll be using the driver framework for this assignment. So the assignment is investigate market efficiency using the gametop short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. verify the accuracy of stated facts. Analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So the first step for this assignment will be to verify the statement games traded at 0.04 in August 2020 against actual historical data. If incorrect document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for the correcting the professor the timeline for the event was in August 2020 GME was near bankruptcy levels September the founder acquired 13% stake in 2021 the due to Reddit there was a price surge to $483 in February 2021 congressal hearings on market manipulation and Present post price stabilization key points we need to take in mind is short interest peaked at 140% of float retail trading volume increased 10fold during squeeze trading resistance restrictions implemented at peak hedge fund uh Melbourne Capital sustained 53% loss acquiring bailout analyst fundamental value estimate was $10 to $40 per share the things we need to analyze is a basically answer after our analysis will be verify all stated historical price data and document corrections. Test which form of market efficiency was violated. Evaluate whether rational investors could have profited estimate systematically. Compare efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behaviors and assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies. So for this analysis as I just told I'll be using the driver framework over here. First we'll start the define phase. So for this phase we'll be testing the efficient market hypothesis. What the efficient market hypothesis basically is that how public information can affect a stock price or it cannot affect the stock price. So can we analyze the stock price through all the public information that we have? So using the 2020 to 2021 game stock will be defined in this phase. Was the market efficient in reflecting information or did behavioral biases and social media cause inaccuracies? So this is the key question for our analysis and we'll be able to answer this in other future parts. So to answer the this question over here verify historical price data and document corrections. I'll be going to my code and explaining that. So for this what we did was we used Yahoo Finance to verify if the stock was being traded at only 4 cents and the actual data comes out to be $2 to4 per share. We can see this through this code and if I also go to Yahoo Finance and this is the historical data of GameStop. If you go over here and see in 2020, it was basically being closed at like 4 and it started around $1. So it was being basically traded between $2 to $4. So hence that was like incorrect information.

Now if you go to a represent stage if the market is a semi- strong efficient GME's price should quickly adjust to all public information like Ryan Cohen's stake announcement. So after the Ryan Coen stake announcement if this was semi- strong efficient market it would have affected the stock price but if you see it did not. So this basically what tells us is that there were other factors involved like social media like people's emotions that we'll cover in our uh reflecting stage but this is basically our represent stage and that is what I checked we used Yahoo finance for finding the historical data we used in Python libraries we all used these Python libraries we were we computed the abnormal returns which is basically the actual minus the expected. So if we go to our code over to the represent stage, we also took the event date to be uh 27th January of 2021. And why we took this uh why we took this event date and analyze the abnormal returns was if we represent stage and if you go to the chart we can see how the abnormal return like peaked at this state and you can see how it reflects with the cumulative abnormal returns. So this is where it peaked the abnormal returns.

Now we can go to the implement stage.

Okay. So,

okay. So, in the implement stage, we took 300 trading days before the event to calculate the abnormal returns as you can see here. And this the date is 21st January 2021.

Event date was taken from the represent stage.

It added a constant uh based on the market return and it also took a estimation window uh that is the 300 days. It calculated the expected abnormal returns

and it also calculated the CR for us which is the cumulative abnormal returns. So if we go here in our stage

after the graph we can we it also depected it in the graph as we were able to see the cumulative AR peaked at between 2.5 and 3 and the abnormal returns peaked at 1.25 on the event date.

Now if we go to the evolve stage was behavior finance explanation. So behavior finance explanation is when the the when there is people taking a bet on the stock market based on their emotions based on what other people are doing in the market and not just based on the public information. So as we can see retail investors follow trends rather than fundamentals. So they did not use the public stock information. They did not depend on what the company is actually valued at but they used what information was given at Reddit. So this is example of a behavioral finance overconfidence trader believe they could beat institutions. So people were investing on it which lead to a huge crash later because they thought everybody is buying it. So the stock price is going to go up. So this is one of another example of behavioral finance loss aversion. Short sellers refuse to exit losing positions early. So short selling is basically buying a stock selling a stock at a low price and then buying it at a higher price. So that is how short selling work but they did not work in this patient. So this is also another example of behavioral finance social influence. So coordination through Reddit amplify buying pressures. So the main part in this or explaining behavioral finance over here is people did not use public information they saw other people what people were doing they played on their emotions and then invested in GameStop rather than using the fundamentals and using the public stock information that were available to them. Okay. Finally the represent stage. This will basically answer all of the questions that were asked uh for our analysis. Which EM EM match uh firm was violated? So it was semi-strong firm in which people rather than actually seeing the value of the company, they invest on the basis of other factors like uh emotions, what other people are doing, peer pressure. So that is why the semi-strong firm was violated over here. So that is why the abnormal returns were huge in in this case. Could rational investors profit symmetrically systematically? No prices moved irrationally and unpredictably as the prices of the stock didn't move according to public stock information and there were other factors included. So I think the investors wouldn't have made profit in this case. EMH prediction versus reality. the EM project price reflect all public info instantly. In reality, GME's price was dominated by emotion coordination. So, this is the point of behavioral finance that comes over here that the price of GameStop didn't affect based on the public information but there were other factors included. So, that is why the prediction versus the reality there was a huge difference and that is why we saw the abnormal return was really high. behavior explanation hype fear of missing out her mentality led to short-term inefficiency. This is again the point from behavioral finance people were feeling firmer uh it was the hype of the game stock uh GameStop stock and the her mentality that if everybody's buying it I'll also buy the stock. So this is uh the behavioral explanation. Final insert the GE short squeeze doesn't fully reject EM. So it doesn't fully say that the market study. So basically what the final insight comes from uh this analysis is that it always doesn't depend on the market efficiencies or the public stock information. There are other factors just as important as that that might impact the price. So that is why a huge learning that I learned from this whole analysis was always to focus on the fundamentals when investing uh not bringing in your emotions uh while investing in stocks because there are other factors that can temporarily create inefficiencies in real market and affect the stock price. So this was basically my assignment using the driver framework explaining this case and answering all of these questions. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"0:00 Hello guys, I'm Andrew Cooper, and I'm going to be talking about the GameStop market efficiency investigation. So, my goal is to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short-stop.
0:14 Squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. I need to verify the accuracy of state of facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficiency market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks.
0:36 So, my event timeline is that GameStop is near bankruptcy levels in August 2020. In September 2020, Ryan Cohen, the Chewy Founder, acquires 13% stake.
0:51 In January 2021, there was a Reddit that there was a price surge to $483. In February 2020, February of 2021, Congressional hearings on market manipulation.
1:07 In the present, there will be post-event price stabilization. So some key data points that I needed to know to do this.
1:24 The short interest peaked at 140% of the float. Retail trading volume increased tenfold during squeeze. Trading restrictions implemented at peak, for example, Robinhood, has increased from $2.00 to $4 Analysts' fundamental values estimated from around $10.00 to $40.00.
1:49 per share. So, using the driver framework, I will start by defining, er, go, start by So, my goal is to pretty much test which of the statements are accurate.
2:04 First of all, the first crucial, crucial step is I need to verify if the game is correct. So, I need to if the game is correct.
2:14 So, I need to verify the game using Yahoo Finance. So, how am I going to implement this in the code?
2:27 I'm going to implement this. I'm going to implement the price, the volume, and the code. I'm going to implement the S&P 500 for, like, the interest and the market model, like, model the market, like, how it's going to go up and down.
2:41 I'm going to implement the short interest numbers for the data, so how high it goes up, like, fast, and how, like, how much interest there is in the short term.
2:52 I'm going to implement the specific dates and times of certain events, so, say, from August 2020, or August 13, 2020, to, like, August 30, 2020, for example.
3:05 And I implemented this in Google Collab, so I'll run it in Google Collab. And, pretty much, this is my code.
3:15 I create, it will create two graphs, and it will show me the average volume of the graphs, right up here.
3:25 So, from January to February 2021. Or, I guess I should do this one. This one first. From August 2020, there is the float and the GameStop.
3:35 No. And this is what the graph looks like. Pretty much, it is very, very slow, very, very slow, very, very slow.
3:46 Once you get to 2021 February, it's, Or, I guess, end of January, beginning of February, it spikes up, and then, right as February hits, I guess, it goes straight back down, and then it goes towards March, and then it goes all up a little bit more.
4:07 And then, that's for the GameStop price. This one is daily abnormal returns versus the SPY or the S&P 500. So, pretty much, as it goes, it goes.
4:22 It's pretty steady towards the middle, sort of, and then it just spikes up, spikes down, goes back towards the middle, spikes up, spikes down, spikes up.
4:31 It's very fluctuating a lot for this app. And then, how I am going to data, this is the confirmed GameStop prices in August 2020 are between $1 and $2, verified by this data.
4:55 around $1 to $2. It doesn't really show on here, but it is verified. Because August is around right here. Yeah, you can't really see it, but, It is verified through, like, Ryan Cohen and other sources, so it is not by comparing the equations, which are accurate.
5:18 So, the equation I used for the daily returns, are the equations, like, the exact equations you need for this. pretty much.
5:27 It's pretty much just, like, verifying that I used the right equation. The graphs both show that there is a volume spike, correct?
5:37 That there is a big spike in both of them around the same time, kind of, it, pretty much both kind of around the same time.
5:46 I would say. Oh, wait, wait, I can't scroll down. Yeah, they're around the same time, pretty much the exact same time.
5:52 And then, this data is credible, Bedale is credible, I mean, the code shows that all the findings are accurate. So, how I'm going to evaluate this is pretty much the weak form efficient market hypothesis is not violated because of the short interest mechanics.
6:10 And normal price patterns, the semi-strong form has a temporary breakdown around the squeeze. The price did not adjust very smoothly and stayed pretty low for many, many months.
6:22 The strong forms were very, very, very unrealistic and do not hold at all. So the GameStop short squeeze is strong evidence of short-term semi-strong inefficiency, but doesn't provide long-term results.
6:38 Objection. How I'm going to reflect this is, pretty much, I think that the driver framework helped a lot with this task.
6:48 But Python code helped me understand the efficient market hypothesis. This process showed me that the game statistics that GameStop can be structured into a driver framework.
6:57 Pretty much, the GameStop market efficiency investigation can be, uh, structured into just a driver framework explaining each step as you go, making me understand it a lot better.
7:14 So I think this has helped me understand market efficiency a lot more. And, uh, that is all. Thank you.",,0,1

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,550
Hi, my name is Alex
Kurtz, and this

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,470
is my section
eight assignment.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:03,950
Okay,

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,000
so kind of what we're
diving in here today

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,110
is we're asking, did
the GameStop of 2020 to

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,030
2021, did that short
squeeze show that markets

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,510
are inefficient, or
can the chaos still

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,390
be explained inside an
EMH-style framework?

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,230
So,

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,170
that's a lot right
there. We're going to

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,490
break it down step
-by-step using driver.

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,770
So we're defining
and we're discovering

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,770
our information.
So we've got to

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,510
verify our key facts.
So our price level

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,760
in the start of this
was August 2020.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,390
GameStop closed
between $1.20 and $1.80

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,850
during August of
2020, ending the month

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,170
around $1.67 per
share, not four cents.

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,790
So it was stated
that it kind of maybe

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,830
ended around four
cents in August 2020.

21
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,870
It's false. It's off by
40%. so short squeeze

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,650
on january 28th of
2021 gamestop hit

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,450
an inter inter trading
high 483 dollars

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,950
so that is about 140
cent more than no

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,530
so during the spike
it was considered a

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,910
meme trade like a
coin like redditors

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,850
were talking about
it um so robin hood

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,890
and e-trade and other
brokers restricted

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,390
buying at GameStop
on January 25th of

30
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,110
2021, GameStop traded
about 175 million

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,090
shares versus the
previous 30-day average

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,870
of about $29 to $30
million a share.

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,630
So breaking the
timeline, August 2020,

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,450
GameStop is
distressed, sub $2 a

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,450
share, but not
collapsing at $0

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,510
.04 a share. But
September 2020,

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,130
this is the first big
turnaround in 2021.

38
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,530
There's call
options, meme coin.

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,670
That's when it
squeezes to about $500.

40
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,050
And then after that,
it kind of collapses

41
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,950
back down to like
about $2 a share.

42
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,730
So it's eating
the GameStop's

43
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,290
historical date
for the assignment.

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,830
GameStop mentions trading

45
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,730
at $0.04 in August 2020.

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,450
It really closed
about $1.67 a share.

47
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,450
I'd flag that in
case you want to

48
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,630
tweak the example.
So we're using data.

49
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,890
All right, so
moving to R.

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,720
So now that we have our
facts, our questions

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,690
clear, we're going to
play out what we're

52
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,650
doing. So using our
GameStop prices, we're

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,090
computing our daily
simple returns, our

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,040
abnormal returns, and
our cumulative abnormal

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,270
returns around the
squeeze. So we're going

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,590
to use a pre-event
baseline and then our

57
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,990
high-volume trading in
mid-January of 2021.

58
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,250
So EMH forms, there are

59
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,990
three types of EMH forms.

60
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,990
Weak form, so
that's past prices,

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,050
looking at past prices
to determine current

62
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,610
prices. Semi-strong
prices reflect

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,890
all publicly
available information.

64
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,990
So like a Wall Street
Journal article

65
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,190
to influence prices,
stuff like that.

66
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,410
Strong form is all
information like public

67
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,810
and private. This
is when you kind of

68
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,910
start getting into insider
trading territories.

69
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,910
It's like if
somebody's on the House

70
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,150
Service Committee
and they're going to

71
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,890
invest in GameStop because
they think GameStop

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,710
is going to prop up
the U.S. economy,

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,810
and a senator buys
shares of that before,

74
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,310
that's strong form.

75
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,050
That's kind of
insider trading.

76
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,570
So we're going to January
28th of 2021. That

77
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,630
was peak. That is our
core event data. So

78
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,010
that's kind of our
lens we're looking at

79
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,320
this through. That's
our event window. um so

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,330
now we're looking at
our behavioral finance

81
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,290
our biases are hurting
our fear of missing

82
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,530
like a foam out our
overconfidence the

83
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,450
gambler's fallacy stuff
like that um that shows

84
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,290
us you know short sale
constraints margin

85
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,710
trading stuff like that
and then our rational

86
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,650
investor probability
so stylized strategies

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,210
so like some brokers
have strategy where

88
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,810
hey we're buying it
on august 15th we're

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,450
selling it february 30th
that's a rash that's

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,510
a stylized strategy and
then uh our slippage

91
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,170
halt restrictions
our realized returns

92
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,530
risk stuff like that
so now we're going into

93
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,030
um our implement
data we have a lot of

94
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,230
imports and stuff like
that our this is just our

95
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,170
ticker data our start
date our end date

96
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,190
stuff like that um this
is just downloading

97
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,050
all of our price and
information data so

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,410
here's our fact check so
it's shows august 2020

99
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,550
and prints uh prints
the daily open and

100
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,870
high lows close for
gamestop it summarizes

101
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,850
our minimum close our
maximum close our last

102
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,670
close which was august
31st so this is just

103
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,090
august 2020 to august
2020 um we have

104
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,210
gamestops around one
to two dollars not four

105
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,530
cents near bankruptcy
levels is kind of fair

106
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,450
but it's not just
pennies it's not super

107
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,130
highly distressed as
i mentioned earlier so

108
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,590
moving on to section
four we show august 2020

109
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,430
to uh we show its
distress september 2020

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,410
is kind of when the
turnaround narrative

111
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,270
starts and then january
2021 that is our melting

112
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,190
up to 483 dollars
a share so um we're

113
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,590
looking for our low
flat flat prices pre so

114
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,910
August 2020 September
we're looking for gradual

115
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,670
grind up if we see
we have some graphs

116
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,750
here that show our
gradual grind ups and then

117
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,250
just spikes as we see
so August 2020 spikes

118
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,330
and then so yeah our
low flat our slight

119
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,050
turnaround and then
spikes stuff like that

120
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,530
so now we look
at sections

121
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,150
5 and 6 of our code

122
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,670
and we're computing
our GameStop

123
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,390
and market value
returns using

124
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,410
using

125
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,130
average risk or
abnormal return

126
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,370
so we look at our
daily abnormal

127
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,950
returns and we use
car to see cumulative

128
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,530
surprise relative
to the market

129
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,390
if our abnormal
returns are huge and

130
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,590
statistically significant
we've got strong abnormal

131
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,550
performance which
is not explained by

132
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,110
the broad market which
is exactly what our

133
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,670
emh cares about so
take that consideration

134
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,430
um then in section
seven we have our

135
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,830
volume analysis so
it just shows us

136
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,210
um that in like our
baseline from october

137
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,990
2020 to january 2021
um like our volume over

138
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,850
our baseline average
volume so we can see our

139
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,870
increase in shares
being traded and then

140
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,250
in section eight we have
our rational investor

141
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,930
scenarios so um if
scenario one we have

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,330
like our like set
schedule buy august 31st

143
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,250
sell january 2027 that's
insane like a multi

144
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,690
-hundred percent return
that's for our structured

145
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,910
our cyclical um
investment strategy and

146
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,830
then but if we're just
buying like market

147
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,490
hype january 28th
south february 5th huge

148
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,990
downtrend some investors
did earn massive profits

149
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,070
but ex-ante strategy
was extremely risky

150
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,290
and subject to halts
which matters for emh

151
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,230
so moving into our
uh v of our driver um

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,130
we have that our
implementation and our

153
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,190
numbers are legit work
we cross-check with

154
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,770
external sources we
have our graphs um as

155
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,690
we see down here so
this is our closing

156
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,610
prices in 2020 our
closing prices starting

157
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,930
the turn around and
then this shows a full

158
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,410
view from in January
so as we see January

159
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,650
18th absolutely spiked
so so all the way

160
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,110
from January first
sorry May to January.

161
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,930
Our statistical
structure, we say that

162
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,650
abnormal return
distribution outside of the

163
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,870
event window should
mostly look noisy around

164
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,930
zero. Within the
event window, abnormal

165
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,150
returns are large,
and our t-test p-value

166
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,510
should be very small
for extreme returns.

167
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,310
Now we evaluate which
forms of our image

168
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,470
look violated. So our
weak form might argue

169
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,410
that our extreme short
interest and low prices

170
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,150
create a predictable
short squeeze candidate,

171
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,010
but many other highly
short stocks never

172
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,750
squeeze timing exact
squeeze was hard so

173
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,350
weak form is not clearly
shown um we can't

174
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,970
show that reliably in
semi-strong form so

175
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,950
we have our public info
like our wall street

176
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,690
boards our short
interest our co-and-stake

177
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,350
um so semi-strong looks
challenged because

178
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,450
the extreme ars and
car around squeeze tell

179
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,050
you prices weren't
just updating new cash

180
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,730
flow, they were
overshooting, so prices did

181
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,530
not reflect public
info in a rational,

182
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,850
fundamental way. They
showed it in a rational

183
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,110
way, like if you're
considering everything

184
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,210
with the Reddit meme
stock and stuff like

185
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,310
that. And strong form
is not plausible here.

186
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,310
They did not have writer

187
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,600
positioning, like there's

188
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,990
no insider information
to buy this.

189
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,450
So GameStop, so seeing if

190
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,670
rational investors could

191
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,110
consistently profit
GameStop, so's a

192
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,410
big ex-profit
opportunity, but no clean

193
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,270
replicable low
-risk strategy that

194
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,290
a rational
investor could use

195
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,830
to systematically
beat the market

196
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,790
in regards to GameStop.

197
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,030
So now we're reflecting.

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Anthony Kwon, and in this video I'll be walking through my Market Efficiency Investigation using the DRIVER framework. My project focuses on the GameStop short squeeze of 2020–2021 and evaluates whether this event was consistent with different forms of market efficiency or whether behavioral factors explain the pricing dynamics. I'll go through each DRIVER stage in order, starting with Define and Discover.

In the Define and Discover stage, the core research question I'm addressing is whether the GameStop short squeeze reflected semi-strong market efficiency or whether the price behavior showed clear signs of inefficiency. Before beginning any analysis, I had to validate a key factual claim included in the assignment prompt, which stated that GameStop traded at four cents in August 2020. This matters because if the starting valuation is wrong, any efficiency argument built on it would be incorrect. So my first objective was to gather reliable data and verify that claim.

To set up the investigation, I identified all required information: daily price and volume data for GameStop, a broad market benchmark such as SPY for CAPM estimation, a timeline of relevant events including Ryan Cohen's 13% stake in September 2020 and the Reddit-driven surge in January 2021, and a framework for conducting event studies to measure how quickly prices reflected information. My initial hypothesis was that if the market were semi-strong efficient, GameStop's price should adjust immediately following new information. Any predictable drift or persistent abnormal return after information becomes public would contradict market efficiency.

Next is Represent. In this stage, I mapped out the structure of my analysis. I chose an event study methodology because it allows me to measure how prices behave before, during, and after major information releases. I built the approach in three parts. First, I used an estimation window of 120 trading days before the event to estimate a CAPM model and calculate GameStop's normal expected return. Second, I defined an event window of plus and minus ten days around the short squeeze peak on January 27, 2021. Within this window, I calculated daily abnormal returns by subtracting the CAPM expected return from the actual return. Finally, I computed cumulative abnormal returns to see whether abnormal performance faded immediately, as predicted by efficient markets, or persisted over several days, which would indicate inefficiency or behavioral bias.

With the structure set, I moved into Implementation. Using Python and yfinance, I downloaded the GameStop and SPY datasets and cleaned the price columns. I merged the datasets, calculated daily log returns, and verified the August 2020 price claim. The data showed that GameStop traded between roughly four and seven dollars during August 2020, which clearly disproves the claim that it traded at four cents. I documented this correction at the beginning of my analysis.

Next, using the 120-day pre-event window, I estimated the CAPM parameters and then calculated abnormal returns around January 27th. The abnormal return graph showed extremely large returns during the squeeze, which is inconsistent with any rational fundamental change. The cumulative abnormal return graph showed persistence even after the main event day. Under semi-strong efficiency, abnormal returns should drop back to zero immediately after the event. Instead, the CAR curve continued to rise or drift, indicating that prices were not adjusting efficiently.

Finally, I performed a statistical test on the post-event period from day plus one to day plus five. The average abnormal return during these days was still significantly positive, and the p-value confirmed that this drift was statistically significant. This is direct evidence against semi-strong efficiency because predictable excess returns remained after information was already public.

Next is Validate. Here, I checked whether my results were robust. I adjusted the size of the estimation window and modified the event window, and abnormal returns still remained unusually large. The statistical significance of post-event abnormal returns persisted across tests. From a market microstructure standpoint, high short interest, retail-driven trading flows, and temporary restrictions from brokers like Robinhood limited arbitrage, allowing mispricing to survive longer than usual. These combined factors support the conclusion that the inefficiencies were real rather than random fluctuations.

In the Evolve stage, I connected my findings to broader implications. The GameStop event shows that markets can behave efficiently most of the time but can become highly inefficient when specific conditions align—such as intense retail speculation, strong social media influence, extreme short interest, and limits to arbitrage. This means the Efficient Market Hypothesis may describe normal market conditions but does not fully capture behavior during chaotic or sentiment-driven periods. These lessons also apply to meme stocks, crypto rallies, and other situations where investor psychology overwhelms fundamentals.

Finally, in the Reflect stage, I considered how this project changed my understanding of market efficiency. Before doing this analysis, I generally believed that markets were mostly efficient and that prices incorporated information relatively quickly. After seeing the extreme disconnect between GameStop's price behavior and any fundamental value, I realized how powerful behavioral forces can be. I also learned that markets can show persistent patterns when arbitrage is limited or costly. Overall, I now view financial markets as adaptively efficient—efficient under normal conditions but vulnerable to inefficiency during periods of stress or speculative mania.

Thank you for watching my DRIVER analysis on GameStop and market efficiency.""",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Jamie Lee, and for this project I investigated the nature of market efficiency by studying one of the most famous events in modern financial history — the 2020–2021 GameStop short squeeze.

My goal was to test whether the extreme price movement in GME aligned with or violated the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which is one of the cornerstones of finance. The EMH essentially states that stock prices reflect all available information.

It comes in three forms — weak, semi-strong, and strong. The weak form says that past prices are already reflected in current prices. The semi-strong form says that all publicly available information is priced in, and the strong form says that even private, insider information is already reflected in market prices.

So the question I wanted to answer was: did the GameStop short squeeze prove that markets are inefficient, or was it simply a temporary distortion that still fits within the theory?

I began by verifying one of the viral online claims — that GameStop traded for as little as 4 cents in August 2020. If that were true, it would suggest total market failure. To test that, I used real data from Yahoo Finance, which showed the actual price was around $1.04, not 4 cents. That means the viral post was simply wrong. This verification step matters because it shows how misinformation can easily spread and distort investor perception.

Moving to the Represent stage, I structured the problem analytically using an event study design and selected four key moments in GameStop's timeline:

August 2020 – when the company was near bankruptcy.

September 2020 – when Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, announced his 13% ownership stake.

January 2021 – the Reddit-fueled short squeeze peak when GME reached over $400.

February 2021 – congressional hearings examining trading platforms and hedge funds.

For each event, I used a 120-day estimation window ending 10 days before the event to estimate a baseline CAPM model for GME returns relative to the overall market. Then I observed a 20-day event window (10 days before and after each event) to calculate abnormal returns — the difference between what the model predicted and what actually happened.

In the Implement stage, I ran all the analysis using Python in Google Colab, importing YFinance, Pandas, NumPy, and StatsModels. I pulled daily GME and SPY data from January 2020 through the present. Using those datasets, I computed daily log returns to standardize price data and remove scaling issues.

After aligning trading days between GameStop and SPY, I fit a CAPM regression model where the dependent variable was GameStop's return and the independent variable was the market's return. This allowed me to calculate expected returns for GME and measure abnormal returns as the difference between actual and predicted performance.

I also computed a 30-day rolling Z-score of trading volume to detect spikes — moments where retail trading activity was significantly higher than normal. The results showed over 50 extreme volume spikes, concentrated almost entirely around January 2021. This perfectly aligned with the height of the short squeeze, when traders from Reddit's WallStreetBets community coordinated massive buying pressure that sent prices soaring.

In the Validate stage, I examined the CAPM model output and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR). The regression results showed that the overall market, represented by SPY, explained very little of GameStop's return variation during the event period. In other words, GME's price movements were almost completely detached from general market conditions — a strong sign that something unusual was happening.

When I plotted the cumulative abnormal returns, I saw massive spikes in late January 2021 followed by sharp reversals shortly after. This pattern of rapid overreaction followed by correction demonstrates semi-strong market inefficiency — prices temporarily deviating from fundamentals before reverting.

The volume data reinforced this interpretation. Z-scores above 3 indicated extreme retail activity, aligning with behavioral finance theory — a textbook case of herding and attention-driven trading overwhelming traditional valuation models.

In the Evolve stage, I connected the data back to financial theory. We saw herding behavior, as thousands of retail traders bought simply because others were buying. Overconfidence bias appeared as investors believed they could outsmart institutions. Representativeness bias showed up as traders viewed the event as a ""retail versus Wall Street"" victory. And loss aversion came into play as short sellers were forced to cover at any price.

Beyond psychology, structural factors also played a role. Limits to arbitrage, short-borrowing costs, trading halts, and platform restrictions (like on Robinhood) prevented rational investors from restoring equilibrium quickly. That combination created a perfect storm that temporarily overpowered market efficiency.

Finally, in the Reflect stage, I looked at what this event means for the theory of market efficiency. Markets are efficient most of the time, but not always. When information flows normally and incentives are balanced, prices reflect reality. But when emotion, technology, and coordination collide, efficiency bends.

The deeper lesson I learned is that market efficiency isn't just about data — it's about behavior. Financial data reflects human psychology and collective decision-making. The GameStop saga shows that behavior can overwhelm fundamentals for a short period, but eventually, rational pricing returns.

Efficiency isn't static; it's dynamic, imperfect, and deeply human.

In summary, through the DRIVER process, I defined the research question, represented it with an event study framework, implemented the CAPM and volume analysis, validated the results with real data, evolved the discussion with behavioral insights, and reflected on what efficiency truly means in modern markets.

Thank you for listening — that concludes my GameStop Market Efficiency analysis.",,0,1

a project about the Market Policy  Investigation. Really emphasizing using the driver framework,  because I know that was mentioned in class oh and some of the critiques in my past submissions.  So I'm going to first  start with what this I was asking for  and just kind of how I went with it.

00:33
There it is. So the assignment overview, we're seeing the market efficiency for GameStop for a certain year starting in 2020. And so we see it was traded for four cents in August 2020, which isn't true. But this is a timeline of how

00:53
going investigate it, see how the price stabilized,  the price  surges, looking at the interest, looking at the market efficiency  in general.  So this is the event timeline, these are the key points and then also just to require analysis as well.  This,  the driver framework, I'm  going go back to here just to make sure I hit every point.

01:21
Okay, there it is. So defines discover. The issue is, we're seeing what we're trying to do with GameStop. The issue is emphasizing on GameStop. So I have this here just to kind of help me make sure I hit every bullet point. So we're trying to see how efficient the market can be for GameStop. And then we have all the data. So we're trying to understand that.

01:54
Sorry,  my taps. Okay.  So just discover how better understanding of what we're doing and the research is done. So  we're seeing if it's like strong,  um,

02:05
different ways that it can be a weak efficiency or a strong efficiency. This is how those historically can change as well. Representing it, the quality framework of analyzing the efficiency of specific events. So this is just the first basic understanding of using the capital asset pricing model. This is the formula that I'll be using it. And then implementing it, I use the Google co-op. And I will show you that.

02:35
So I guess now we're in the implement section. So let me start from the beginning. So I first asked it to give me a basic understanding of what's happening. We see it's a dollar four cents for the stock in August 2020. When it was high, it was a dollar 67. So we can just see kind of like the magnitude of it and then also verify it. We see that these changes and stakes are accurate. Now we're going to analyze what's going on. Was it violated?

03:05
form, we can't profit  from the data.  As we see that this part is violated, the semi strong form, it's annihilated.  And then we see the public data. So like these stakes are public. So we can kind of understand like, was this efficient? Was this inefficient,  or not? And then we can compare that  with oh the prediction and observed behavior.  And so I first  asked it to create a code of like understanding oh the  formula that

03:35
showed earlier and executing it so that we actually understand like what's going on what these numbers mean.  First  install that so let me like run it again just to show you  this analysis. It's gonna load.  Boom!

03:55
There it is. This is the data. So we see the timeline from the end of 2020 till the first beginning, end of the first quarter of 2021. We see the surge here. We can see the different trade volume, GME, close price, because I also asked it to create more reiterations. I'll get to when I validate it.

04:18
So you can see like there was a huge surge here at how that affected the volume. And then you see the price of it well, so it went like above $80 for the steak. And so just kind of investigating the more.

04:34
We  used  the Google Gemini  to create the code to kind of understand what each means.  Now following back to the driver framework,  we see the data from that historically.  Fact checking it, we see the lowest price was 64 cents. um So it's a little bit  not, it's inaccurate from the original  factor that we have.  But we can see that's verified that there was a pre split pike.

05:04
the insights of it, um we have a better understanding or implementing it.  We  can calculate these returns  using here, the data here.  See like the price verification,  the lowest price, the highest price, and it's just verifying those results as well.  Then we can calculate, you know, the abnormal returns and also the cumulative returns and then validating that we can use  a statistical significance.

05:34
way and then also just testing it out and these results as well.  So  evolving is an  application of efficiency and testing so we can apply what we learned about you know the market efficiency what's going on.

05:52
apply to  different uses  involving the market efficiency. feel like any stock,  any company, you always want to see is it efficient,  is the profit, like how's the profit, how's the expansion,  how's the growth rate of it. So using these different sources  and data to create, to help create these assumptions, also just predicting the  observed behavior.  I feel like that's so important with market analysis as well.  That's kind of how it evolves um just with these applications.

06:22
with investment strategy  you can't predict the future you can  try to  but can't  you know it's not like a genie you're not going to know immediately what it is so having a framework like this

06:40
Sorry.

06:42
Having a framework and using these models to help kind of predict you and guide you with a decision is extremely important. Looking at the different financial behaviors and also analyzing it relating to the market efficiency. And so again, I still really wanted to emphasize following the driver framework. Like I said before, I did do a reiterations of the code. So here you see a graph. Here I had this code

07:12
do a basic understanding I had to tweak it a little bit  but  this is a different um  between the different stakes  that we  had.

07:23
Again, huge peak in very beginning of 2021. You see a change in adjustment at the end of 2020, which validates what we said earlier. Different variation. I think this code was this code. I messed up. I use this one. I just went back. Here we see more of the data, kind of like the number crunching of it using the formulas from earlier. So we kind of generated the plot, but we found

07:52
Checking it again, like I said, this is what just said these volumes you can see that, you know earlier on 2021 There was a higher like about here. You see, you know the averages for that as well So let me go back here kind of just an analysis of everything as well

08:20
We see.

08:23
you know, the marking  market efficiency testing worked out, we can see,  you know,  how here's the fabric.  We can understand the weak versus the semi strong and strong form efficiency. uh The weak one might be less risky.  But there might be a higher reward from that from the model we stated earlier. ah

08:49
So you kind of see how all plays out using the public and private information. That's the strongest bet. We know the most amount of information. It's most efficient. Then using the semi strong form, you know, just the public information and the weak form, which is like what's doing historically, it's less risky. You just kind of know the end result, which is not what you always want. In that case, you want to take that risk. You want to make it the most efficient, you know, make the most profit. What makes the most sense within the company itself? The information corporation

09:19
incorporation. the data was able to kind of reflect on the information we had and how we were going to go through it and then also just the behaviors behind the data analysis.

09:36
I also forgot to mention that I was able to source some of the data involving it  using just kind of like the internet.  And so I kind of imported it and that's then it had data to actually use.  Last bit just to make sure I got hit the points, the technical implementation of it.  kind  of the timeline. we kind of see like  the clean period of what's going on before  and how long  it'll take  the event window involving the market efficiency  and kind of the aftermath

10:06
of it. With the actual calculations, we see the framework between the actual return, the expected return, the event return, and also just a surprise. So these were the coding points that I was able to put in the original one. And then again, just look at the statistical testing of it, we see the null hypothesis.

10:33
um The data analysis and pattern identification, we kind see what's violated and what's considered efficient.  If we see it's flat or when we see it spikes, what does that mean in total?  And then again, I was able to use the Python  sources.  And then also before, um just a clear  explanation um about what's kind of going on with the

11:02
uh, efficient market, I efficiency for the market, um, the hypothesis. So the price is right. That's basically what it's all about. We kind of see what makes sense between the strong, the semi and the weak form. It's the weak form, the price reflects all the past.

11:20
trading data, implying the implication of that is the technical analysis. So you kind of can't really predict it just from charts. And then the semi strong form shows kind of with all the public data. So the different news sources, earning reports, and what the company publicly displays. So we can implement that. Just kind of seeing how the earning reports affect each other. And the strong form using everything public and private, which is the most amount of information.

11:50
you here the CEO  can't even beat the market with that.  you kind of see what resources you have and using that data to implement to make it easy to understand.  And then again, you know, the efficiency of it, looking at the case studies,  how every year affects one another. And then these are  a couple of extra  bullet points that I thought would be useful for people to understand kind of  how the market bubble works. You know, the dot-com bubble, how did that affect the market?  The value effect, you know, what  cheap and

12:20
you know,  expensive stocks with a lot of value  and also just the momentum effect. So these were  all the points.  Just making sure I kind of hit everything. I made sure to follow the driver technique and then  the Google Pro Gemini was really useful in kind of  understanding just because I feel like now we're getting to topics that are definitely a lot more  involved. um

12:47
there's just more things happening  and so I was able to use data important from uh I use yahoo and just like other  uh information that was available on google  and implementing that and I thought it was definitely overwhelming at first but the program I was able to work together well

13:05
I  some issues because I felt like it was such an information overload that even the Google Gemini didn't know what was going on. So I kind of had to tweak it out. So that's why I kind of asked  sections by code for me to implement here to make it easier to understand and visualize here.

I  am gonna start my session eight.

00:03
assignment about the market efficiency investigation.  So first we're trying to investigate the GameStop case study that happened in 2020, uh looking between the efficient market hypothesis and also the behaviorals behind the market efficiency. So I'll go more in depth between those two because those were the main uh points between.  And so first of all,  this statement saying the GameStop traded at four cents and

00:33
in August 2020, that is inaccurate.  I use the data from the Yahoo Finance, that was my source that I used  for all the graphs and all the equations and  those will be the data points I will use throughout  my  analysis.  And so this  is the data I use, it was actually a dollar and five cents, which is still low,  but it's very different from the four cents given here.

01:00
I'm also gonna explain,  I'm first gonna show the... the...

01:08
analysis through using the Google Pro Gemini  and how I was able to incorporate that  into the Python code which will show  graphs  and an analysis using equations and modeling  that will be  a good visual to see  and then how that relates to why  the game game stop is affected throughout the markets  using the EMF and then also the behavioral analysis.  So first of all  this

01:38
equation. one of the models, this  uses the capital asset pricing model.  So we find the rates and the assets  using this equation. This is one of the main equations that I use for this graph that I'll show you in a minute.  And then also the anomaly, which I'll explain later on. m

01:59
So the first main issue with this  whole situation, this case study was  the different forms of the market efficiency were violated.  So first, the weak form here  was violated because we can't go past the trading data that we already have.  The semi strong form was  annihilated  because this was also a core violation since  all the publicly available information was already reflected in the stock price.  Therefore,  in

02:29
efficient market, it wasn't incorporated.  And so we just kind of neglected that information for the semi strong form of the market behavior.  And then the strong form just also wasn't relevant at all, since it dealt with private information. So it wasn't public for us to really use.  So this event  didn't  correlate to the private data, we are looking specifically into the public data. oh

02:51
And then also following with the driver technique,  what are we trying to solve? What are we trying to explain?  I'm trying to explain why this case study is so important,  just because you would initially think,  oh, in the market, you can't predict what's going on, but there's certain safety nets  that you can hold yourself accountable with your company to try to make the most amount of profit or  most amount of, you know, with the asset ratios, what would be the best investment? But also you have to look behind the behaviors of it.

03:21
as well.  Obviously, the efficient market hypothesis, you kind of have a baseline of what's going on, but specifically, there's different behaviors  that I will go into. So for example,  hurting,  overconfidence, loss aversion, anchoring, those are the main components that  kind of built the catastrophe  with  within GameStop.  Because,  know, investor with the hurting, all the investors were going in,  which affected the  smaller investors and also just a smaller analysis,  so much was

03:51
going into specifically  GameStop and the hurting, which affected the market price. So many people were going into it.  There wasn't  a good end result from it.  Overconfidence. Some investors just also overestimated their skills and  also just kind of how much GameStop was worth.  This was also, I would like to note, was also extremely temporary.

04:15
Sorry, it was temporary  with the public information. We just didn't see the  live  up-to-date information about it.  So some things were inaccurate price or the percentages investments the marketing behind it.  So that also affects the behavioral factors because  everyone was trying to join into the crowd and cause you know the issues with hurting  and then the last two loss aversion anchoring. So it's also just the psychological behind the investors. It was so much going into it which caused

04:45
such a  huge issue  and then also just anchoring  so like I said before the data was wasn't up to date  therefore it was kind of arbitrary data people were kind of  guessing predicting it was pretty random so that wasn't the best result  I also would like to mention this data I mean this graph that I created just to kind of show a better understanding between the different forms so the weak and the semi-strong  and the strong form about all that information and how that affected it

05:15
So  obviously the weak form was  there or was violated.  The semi-strong wasn't even acknowledged  and there wasn't a need for the strong form information.  The main issue with this case study also was the fact  that there was a glitch in the market, which means there was an abnormal return.  So you can see this  equation  pretty simple. It's the actual return minus  the expected return.  We see

05:45
that with  the abnormal return if it was really large you see there's

05:52
a lot of something that's unexpected and that makes sense with the different behaviors because with all these different behaviors happening obviously the the stock will decrease and it won't be as much of a return in the investment as people were hoping for. I also would like to mention as a result with this event we also noticed the issues with the arbitrage arbitrage um

06:21
with solvency and just like the market risk as well because the arbitrage is supposed to be the safety net from all these issues, but we actually can see deep down of how they all actually affected each other and how this certain behavior affected the the effects of the arbitrage and then how that also vice versa affected each other. So since I kind of represented all the data points, how am I going to implement this? I implemented this by using Python.

06:51
To use for the Google Co lab to know the market also failed because of the lack of the critical information Hence the weak form of the data. So there's also short interest that peaked at 140 % of the public flow So that was neglected and that wasn't it should have been priced in but wasn't so therefore the stock trading and the premiums were kind of reflected that and it was a short squeeze So that's why the game stop case study can also be a lot of people mentioned

07:21
short squeeze behind it. So it was 483 per share but it wasn't driven directly from the company's fundamental assets and values, which was only 10 to 40 dollars. But everyone kind of realized how the structure was working and so hence the different behaviors. Everyone was just hurting to the crowd. Everyone was like, oh this is such a large amount of money, let's go in, let's get into all that. And so this affected all the different financial modes.

07:51
behind it and also just the normal behaviors. That's why this is also a really special case because it's not triggered by the traditional market participants. It was kind of affected by like social media and just the behaviors. So people were thinking more with their head.

08:07
but not, or people were thinking more about what was kind of going on, what they're kind of had wanted, but not initially taking a step back what was going on.  I use the Google Pro Gemini, how I implemented this, want, like I said before, I use the code.  So I first kind of put in the data, asked it to create a code using the data from like August 2020, which is like what it started. It's like the low amount of like force  sense,  that was like the  inaccurate data.  I asked it to create a code  and  here shows,

08:37
I did a couple different reiterations, but the final product that I want to show has this craft. So as you can see, let me make this a little bit bigger. As you see, there is timestamps between the 2020, 2021, that little short squeeze here. We see how much the actual GameStop close price was, and then also the trade value, mean, trade volume. So you see.

09:05
lots of millions  of the trade was implemented and then this is how it kind of went up. So  looking at that data, it  reflected  on  these different key points.  Let me go back to here.  I want this to be...

09:25
easily visible to understand, let's say in a day process within the stock market and how the market efficiency worked. So this shows each day in 2021, it shows the close high low open volume. So, you know, the open right when the market opened, how much it was the lowest it was the highest it was and then when we close the market for a day. this shows the number of logistics behind it and also the volume you see there.

09:55
so  many people, you can see the increase, so many people were falling into the crowd with all that behavior,  know,  main emphasis on hurting,  I feel like that was the most  prominent one between the people and you can see that because the amount of people that just joined into this stock just increased significantly.  Then it kind of died down once people realized what was going on within the market. The value wasn't as valuable as they thought it was initially.

10:22
I also  wanted to create more data sets that had a better explanation of what was going on  and also just kind of visualizing in a different aspect as well.  So this model here.

10:36
This model right here has a better representation with more analysis. So you can see the average price of the game. So you got to compare it also from 2019 game. So why would every why would people just kind of go up to GameStop? You see the difference between 2019 2020. That's why this case study is also highly regarded because you see such a big difference between what happens with everyone's behaviors. Everyone wants the money. Everyone wants to be where the money is. So you can see

11:06
the squeeze peak of when everyone, you know, when everyone bought the stocks and joined in within the market and then the close price. So you can see here that the Ryan Cohen stake is here early on in 2020, right when it was happening and then kind of how it shot up and then also kind of how it was dying down with that.

11:37
to know Ryan Cohen, who is the CEO of GameStop. So he had a large percentage of the shares, obviously. And so that also affect, that had, that was a big point in the analysis as well. So that is the code. Let me reiterate this one one more time. Oh wait, that was just the graph. Okay.

12:01
Like the graphs I showed you before, some of those numbers, how did we get them? Like I said before, we use these equations that  show that  took analysis behind the expected return  for GameStop, the risk free rate, the T-bill,  and the market return between these as well. And also just the riskiness  of  the whole process. Like I said before, you can't predict how the market's going to be,  but

12:27
there is a sense of regard  and kind of a framework that you should follow.  And that's why I was causing such an issue because everyone had  a behavioral issue with it, but also a bias, which is what I'll get into.  So arbitrage, that is what limits all these risks or at least helps the market in that aspect.  We can see with this specific case study, the rational investors, people that should have known what was going on,  they are supposed to be aware of their stocks are overvalued or

12:57
issues like that within the GameStop,  but this whole process or this whole story or not story case study  Proof that this  can be destroyed as well. So these two major risks So the retail herd acted irrationally and also in unison which made the price even jump higher than it should have been  and then the solvency risk that is the main

13:21
a thing that was kind of affected using the arbitrage. So we see, you know, different like hedge funds that had that like try to correct that the game was overvalued, but they had to liquidate because of the different issues. So in like January 21, other factors in the market that kind of just affected these different companies as well.

13:43
Also to validate  this discovery and kind of the data analysis behind it,  I added a

13:54
iteration into the code  here. So we kind of see visually why these numbers equated to that. Why  was there such a big jump in that time range or in that time  frame  within GameStop? And then now

14:14
market everyone's pretty irrational about it so it kind of remains solvent in that case  and here  these are the different cases of just kind of how  we approach it so

14:26
It was recommended to just kind of have a passive investment strategy behind it.  So the EMF, while  it's important, it's also  imperfect.  It provides a baseline for passive investing.  We can see if like, if  markets are efficient enough,  but also statistically we can see behind it,  why it might consistently outperform or underperform uh the market behind it. And so this kind of shows as a warning and this

14:56
is a  big lesson for lots  of hedge funds and just firms and such being aware of  what's going on with the management behind it.  And here,  like I said before, it could be obliterated by just behavioral risk. You can't  predict behavior. Unfortunately, I mean, there's psychology behind it, but unfortunately, these behaviors,  it's gonna...

15:20
Snowball and that's kind of what we saw like GameStop with those effects and then this is the case for the active management While obviously those behavioral there are some activeness to it people saw them on where was the money going? That's where I want to be a lot of people were going to where the market was With that money and all of that momentum and value as well. I would also like to mention aside from behaviors and the EMS

15:50
you can also just acknowledge the risks behind it as well.  So in a related sphere of market friction, leverage corporate structures can incentivize asset substitution or risk  shifting. So you should be aware of these issues because it also just kind of serves as another example of how  rationally people can also just exploit how the system and the framework of the market  works together, which can also just lead to inefficiency  and also just destroying the simple models as well.

16:20
Like I said before, did do a couple reiterations of this just to make it more accurate.  Obviously, I couldn't keep the first iterations because I was adding on to the final one.  But in the beginning, I didn't have a graph. I wanted to kind of implement it be visually  available to  also  validate it. And so that's why I kind of created this graph as well.  And

16:45
does make sense overall, it does make sense. And the fact that I remember hearing about what was happening within the market and how GameStop affected and how of a catastrophe it was, and it makes sense because at the end of the day, while we do know the technicals behind it, the professionalism is extremely important. The behaviors behind it, especially with the market.

17:09
It's kind of how people feel about things.  And I feel like that was just something that was emphasized and you could see that it was brought  to light uh about it.  And then, there a better way of doing it?  I think having it visualized is good, because you see that first, they thought it was so much more  in value,  but...

17:36
It wasn't, what was it? They lacked public information, was a keeping error, but you thought that the share was $483 each. But it was only estimated to be what, $1040? And then at the end of the day, $1.05. That kind of shows the inaccuracies and kind of the risk that you have to be careful with in the market. Also,

18:00
I forgot to mention that since it was obviously overvalued, we know that. It also just lacked the infinite capital that needs to have such a high stake in the market with a company with that type of value to also just remain solvent against a different price surge. Also, we see issues, obviously, a lot of people were upset there was issues within the market and the brokers also just had to stop buying, which affected everything else in the market as well.

18:30
companies kind of had a domino effect that affected  each other specifically within the market.  And then this cycle also caused  more collateral risk in the market,  aside from what we already  were expecting  just from the GameStop value.  So  this kind of all ties together because you realize how  for a success in the company, even a success in trading,

18:57
and per share in the market, all these little factors come together.  I noticed specifically that  it really comes down to,  at the end of the day, we're all people.  We all have different behaviors.  When it comes to money, people will have different opinions and ideas and options.  These four  main  behaviors is what really  made

19:25
the GameStop issue and kind challenged the efficiency model hypothesis and went against what the EMF was EMH was supposed to do because we all have a certain bias that affects that affects our judgment as well. And then these also three effects were all come to play at one point, the momentum effect, the value effect and the size effect. So kind of see how maybe the smaller socks, you know, how they're tended with the

19:55
the value  stocks and just kind of how they might uh outperform the growth stocks and then just the momentum between,  oh this stocks kind of winning, this stock is losing, we should go to the winners,  eventually affecting the behavior of hurting.  And so those were the main key points of that. ah

20:15
from this process really focusing  on  kind of  more the professional or behavioral side  of the market. kind of learned on the past couple weeks touching base on  what we did, what's going right technically with certain equations that  thanks to the Google Pro Gemini, some of  what it was asking for specifically  within the equations, I was able to use that to create the pie

20:44
down code for the colab  to have a better visual visualization of it and then overall  overall we see you know  consequences of your own actions  and I

21:00
depth I deep dive more into which approach would have been the most responsible and I made the conclusion of using the passive allocation. Having more of a passive approach while there are pros and cons for each one, it utilizes the baseline market efficiency the best. You still want to use that model because that gives a big framework and base work of how it should be but also kind of protects the investors. Obviously

21:27
so many people coming in that's that was the main issue with GameStop but being able to kind of protect them kind of understand what's going on has a better approach and it's more on more aware and less catching someone off guard with how the market goes back and forth and it also just limits the effects of the arbitrage.

21:49
That was my analysis  and just explanation about  kind of how everything  worked  for  the GameStop short squeeze event in 2020. That short squeeze were kind of, you know, spurred up and all of that.

22:07
We see, we also just see how you know, Ryan Cohen, how he got that stake, how that affected it, all the price search to $483, which was accurate that this was given this right here. It's not accurate.

22:23
according to the Yahoo Finance. And just see how it peaked, you know, 140%, how we see the squeeze affecting the market efficiency, the losses behind it, what actually was the share amount, which is only estimated to be $10 to $40, depending on the time of the market, and how all of the different forms that we need to be aware of when making these decisions were violated, looking at the private information, looking at the public information.

22:53
and how that EMF  EMF  EMH sorry  EMH  model  almost contradicted the behavior or at least it wasn't prepared for the behavior behind it and then the anomalies for that and then also  these  rational investors

23:15
systematically  while they  thought they were profiting off of it, they weren't fully considering  how it would affect the market.  people in the very beginning,  not to say probably  got something out of it, but  eventually the ones later in the crowd didn't.  Thank you.

right. So, today uh we're looking at
GameStop GME
uh when they had a short squeeze uh in
basically 2021, January 2021. Uh we'll
be doing a little case study on it. Um
so, timeline we're looking at um 2020 GM
nearly bank hits near bankrupts. Their
trading stock is really low. Uh and then
it's September 2020. Uh Ryan Cohen uh
acquires a 13% stake uh 20 January 2021
uh on the Reddit rwall street bets. Um
the price uh skyrockets basically due to
a big collusion between a bunch of
different people on the subreddit.
Um and then February 2021 there's
collusion hearings on market or
congressional hearings, sorry, on market
manipulation. Again, ton of people were
buying the stock to try to drive the
price up. Uh so, government was a little
worried about that. Uh and then
presently, uh this big squeeze is kind
of slowed down. So, it's back to
hopefully where it should be. And I
mean, that's what we'll be looking at
today. Uh we've also got some key data
points here. Um kind of just tells us a
little bit more about the situation. Uh
some important ones are the retail
trading value or volume that increased
tfold during the squeeze. Again, the
squeeze happened because a ton of people
were buying and selling the stock. So,
it's going to make sense that uh the
volume is going to increase a lot if
there's a squeeze like that. Um they put
some trading restrictions at its peak uh
basically because they were worried
about um you know this kind of collusion
almost.
Um then hedge fund Melvin Capital
sustained a 53 loss or 53% loss. Uh
they're one of the groups invest in
invest uh buying and selling a lot of or
basically buying a lot of the stock. Um
and yeah so they took a big hit because
of that. Uh then really the big
important one is analyst fundamental
value estimates $10 to $40 per share. So
this is where we expect uh the share
should be sitting at their price. Um,
which as you can see here, uh, the they
say the price surge goes to 483.
Um, so before I get into the driver
framework, I'd like to just validate
uh validate some of this data. Uh, so
we're asked first to validate uh we're
told GameStop traded at 4 cents in
August 2020. Uh, so we want to check is
that actually true. In reality, it's
not. Um, we get data that it opened at
one $11 and closed at 160 at 160
uh 167 and its lowest was a dollar which
we can confirm. Uh, I was looking just
on Yahoo Finance. Um, in the past and we
can see here we can look at pretty much
all of August. Uh, and it's really
around a dollar the entire time. It
never actually uh drops below a dollar.
Um see like the first one uh the first
date for August uh that it's trading at
is at 10 101
um it's around that. So basically what
we're getting at is that it is bigger
than that. 04 um there's that 4 cents.
Um, but in the way we're looking, it's
really not a big issue because we're
looking at uh where it said the
uh fundamental value is $10 to $40 per
share. So, it's bas it's already well
below that $10 uh minimum. So, at that
point, a 4 cents to a dollar difference
uh 4 cents to a dollar really doesn't
make a huge difference because we're low
below that fundamental valuation. Um,
but it is a difference. So, it's key to
be pointed out. Um, a second little part
I noticed
um was the height in January 2021. So,
when the situation with the Reddit uh
Reddit was happening um when I was
looking I saw it only hit 121.75 max um
which we are told it hits uh has a price
surge up to 483. Uh again, if we look at
Yahoo Finance during that time, uh if we
get to January 2021,
uh see a slow increase, but nothing too
that seems too severe. And then
I thought I had it a little higher. Let
me update the date a little further.
I'll go just a little bit.
There we go. Uh just so we get a full
view of it. Um, we can see here when
we're looking at our maxes, um, as it's
increasing, the biggest Wait, did I put
that right?
Yeah, 120. Um, so anyway, we can see
that the max it does hit is $120.75.
Uh, so that's a really big difference
obviously in maxes, but it's still way
over that fundamental value. So it does
matter uh because again that's a big
difference and we want to note those
differences uh when we're looking at our
historical data. But again it's over
what our fundamental value seems to be
and we can see the uh like pretty we can
pretty vividly see the spike in its uh
in its value. So just important to note
but we know we still have a spike there.
Um but we note that it's a little lower
than what we're told in the uh problem
for our analysis. So now that we got
that out of the way, we can actually get
into the driver framework. Um so our
first stage is discover uh define
discover. Uh we ask what is market
efficiency testing and then what are we
actually anal at analyzing? Uh so first
off, what is market efficiency testing?
Um it basically looks at the market uh
the market and we're trying to see is a
spike like this because of a random
event um something like a Reddit uh a
bunch of people on Reddit buying a stock
at the same time um or is it natural um
is it like just basically not there's
not a discre discrepancy and um
kind of looking at how fundamental value
plays into it and uh trading how like if
it's natural trading or um is there
something with behavioral finance mixed
into it? Uh we don't know. So basically
looking to see is it some sort of event
that makes it happen um that's actually
driving the price up uh and like
sustainable or is it something that's
not sustainable and uh it's just a big
collusion to shoot the price up and make
a squeeze.
So uh this leads us into efficient
market hypothesis. Um we're looking at
basically
uh ways to assess if uh GME has ever
violated uh any of these hypotheses that
lead to efficient market. Uh so weak um
the weak
weak form efficiency this means uh this
is when current prices reflect reflect
past prices and volume data um which we
can see with
where we at
uh we can see with Reddit again there's
a huge spike here um and all the data
below is it does start to steadily
increase from that dollar but uh go
growing from $5 to $10 to 20 to 60 90
just shooting up like that um isn't
something that's based off of pure
historical data. Uh you don't get an
increase like that just out of the blue
in in a single month or in a few days.
Uh so you can tell that it's not um not
weak the weak form efficiency that's
being violated. Uh semi-trung this is
when current prices reflect publicly
available information. Uh so something
like people talking online that might
know some things or uh different news or
financial statements that have been
released. Um and this is kind of
indicated that is what uh what is being
violated. Uh again there's people
talking we get told uh uh there was an
investment uh Ryan Ryan in acquired 13%
stake um which is good for the company.
Um, and then we can see in January, uh,
Reddit, Wall Street Bets, uh, everyone
can look at that subreddit and see that,
uh, they're happy or they think that GME
is about to explode. So, they can look
at that and say, well, I'm going to go
buy it before it explodes. Um, that
leads to more and more people buying it.
Um, and yeah, eventually it just it
definitely exploding like we saw. Uh,
but not something that's not really
sustainable. So when we look at that uh
it does suggest that uh semi- strong uh
efficiency has been violated. Uh then we
get to strong um strong uh form
efficiency. So when current prices
reflect all information public and
private um so again it's basically
everything with semi strong plus private
information which is hard to actually
prove. Um,
it can I guess it can happen with a
squeeze, but it's hard to prove when uh
there's stuff like insider trading or
things like that. Um, which obviously is
illegal, but uh if that's happening,
it's not really as private. Um, it's
going to be more public. So, it's a
little more theoretical, but it is
something to talk about, but in this
case, it doesn't seem like that's what
was violated in Reddit's case. So,
this uh
um so here again what are we analyzing
we basically want to see was Reddit's uh
big increase in these days something
that happened naturally or something um
in something that would have been
possibly sustainable or just a random
event. Um so that gets us to represent
uh we're going to talk about event study
meth method methodology and the C. Uh so
uh event meth study method methodology
sorry I don't know why I keep messing up
on that word. Um so the goal is to find
AR uh which is basically just the
difference between observed and expected
return in this event that had not
occurred. uh if this event had not
occurred. Um so we're looking at the
result we did get and then we have to
actually kind of get a prediction for
what it would have been had uh people on
Reddit not been talking about this stock
GME. Um so that's event study study
methodology. Uh and then C is cumulative
abnormal returns. Uh so basically the
summation of abnormal abnormal returns
in a over a specific period. So again,
kind of basically what it sounds like if
we have a m massive spike uh look with
squeeze like what happened with Jimmy uh
trying to summate those returns um and
then we can actually analyze them. So
that's the uh what we'll be using to
study this event and uh look at its
price changes uh relative to the market.
So uh one important thing to mention I
guess for event study methodology is
that to do this calculation we're going
to need alpha and beta. uh last time I
talked about it, I guess. But beta is
basically how uh closely a stock follows
the market. Uh how risky it is, I guess
you could say. So if it's above one or
much higher than one, uh that means it's
a pretty risky stock, but it has a high
return. If it's lower than one, has a
lower risk, but not quite as high of a
possible return. Um so that's one of the
things we'll have to be calculating to
actually get these results. So that
gives us to
uh the code for our implement stage. So
um I'll kind of be mixing implement and
validate here. Uh I guess I I'll go with
the implementation first because this
kind of does our represent stage. Uh
gets results for a represent stage.
So here we go. Uh so we have a bunch of
imports from different uh finance
websites. um to get some actual accurate
data. Um we have our defining parameters
kind of what we did with driver uh just
knowing what we want to do. Uh one of
the important things is looking at the
event date uh or event window. So we're
looking basically 21 day 21 trading
days. So 3 weeks of uh between this
event. So we look here, we look 10 days
before this leakage um or before the
squeeze. Um here we get that set. Then
we have our peak squeeze. Those days
when it was hitting its peak around this
spot and then we have our uh post
squeeze. So basically when things start
to settle back to normal. So these are
the three time periods we'll kind of be
looking at uh to make a analysis on.
uh get some helper functions.
Uh second step uh basically just
collecting the data we need. Um sip of
water.
Uh so getting the data we need.
All right. Uh then we get into our
parameter estimation. So this is where
we're actually going to be trying to
calculate uh what we want for our event
study method methodology and our C. So
goes through uh does some calculations
pull some more data in uh we're able to
extract our parameters alpha and beta
here which I said we need and then also
some our residual variance uh which is
important to look at how consistent our
data is.
Um step four. Oh, I guess this is
technically I guess this is where we get
to see our C. Uh does our abnormal
calculations here
um then a aggregates it.
Uh
and then we get into validate which I
guess I'll talk a little bit more after
I cover this. So basically what this
code does uh tells us what our event
window is um and then does this whole
regression result uh gives us these
regression results for our uh market
model. Um basically bunch of different
information
sorry um
it's not too important for us to look at
right now. It goes more in depth than
really even I know what to do with uh
but some of the important results that
come from it. uh again are the alpha and
beta we need. Um so we can see here our
alpha is our intercept uh which is
pretty close to zero. Um and then our
beta is hanging around one. So again
this means that generally in the past um
GME had moved pretty well with the
market. Um didn't really have any major
spikes or major dips uh compared to the
market. It's not like it was just
randomly jumping up. Wasn't a
high-risisk highreward stock. It wasn't
a lowrisk lowreward stock. is pretty in
the middle. Um something you'd kind of
expect if you're matching it with um the
uh why can't I think of the name? S&P.
Uh yeah, S&P. Uh it might move pretty
well with that. Um and then we get to
our cumulative returns. Uh I guess I'll
talk a little bit more like that. We
have a better graph with that. But uh
let me talk about the validate stage
real quick. uh because this is where
we'll be doing some statistical
significance testing. So u um this is
basically just testing if our C for each
period uh has a an abnormal return or
not. Um so something again we're seeing
if that Reddit spike uh that spike that
we assume is caused from Reddit is out
of the blue or something we could have
actually expected and maybe uh someone
smart would have been able to see
coming. So,
get back to the code here. Um, so I
normally for this I would just use a t
test. Um, and it does use a t test. Uh,
that's the one we'll kind of I'll kind
of talk about here. Um, just to see
again if it's abnormal or not. Uh, it
also does a will
coxin uh signed rank test. I'm not too
familiar with it. Uh but it's basically
just taking some a little more of the uh
randomness out of it. Uh it doesn't use
a normal hypothesis uh like the t test
does. Um but it does have those
calculations. So
uh so we get to this graph and again it
tells us uh basically our all of our
information. So pre-event leakage uh
which is again the 10 days before the
event uh we get a p value of 0.588
um and what we're looking at with this
is if it's under 005 I guess tells us
here uh if it's under 5% our p value
that means that we're looking at
something that is abnormal um something
that wouldn't be expected from past data
uh given our variance uh and our
expected values
So again, this is a lot higher than the
0.05. Um, so that means the 10 days
leading up to it, uh, we actually have
a, uh, C value that's negative 11. Um,
so that means it's actually kind of un
underperforming in the market. Um, which
makes sense when you look at it. It's
not doing too great. Uh, especially if
you compare it to the market. But
um yeah, 111% uh C isn't isn't ideal,
but it also doesn't uh if we look again
at the P value doesn't mean anything
really abnormal is happening here. Um so
then we look at peak squeeze. So that
three days where it goes ballistic and
increases by tens tens of dollars all
the every day up to what was it 120?
Yeah, 120. Um so if you look at that it
has a CR value of 66%. Uh so this is a
huge increase. Um
it indicates that we have a abnormal
return during the short squeeze. We can
see the p value is zero. Uh which means
there's really nothing to base it off
base it off of. Um and it means most
likely we have some event happening
that's causing it to spike as it did. Uh
then post postevent uh next six days
about uh we get uh
156% increase
um which is very high uh I'm sure you
can tell but um sorry.
Yeah. Okay. Um, so basically we can tell
it still is seeing very high returns.
Um, even after the event, uh, which we
can see it's much higher than it was,
uh, it's at 12% or 12% $12 compared to
hanging around about the four or five
dollars it was before. Um, so this again
is a big jump, but we can see here it's
kind of starting to be sustained. And if
we look a little further into the
future, go
go June, sometime in June, we can see
it's definitely still high and a lot
higher than it had been before. So you
can say that maybe this spike actually
helped pe bring people like to view this
stock and value it. Um, so again, it's a
lot higher than we would actually
expect. Um and it got a lot higher
because of something not really based on
history or based on anything with the
stock which we can see because we have a
lower p or basically no p value um and
which is lower than that 5%. So uh
basically that's our analysis here. Um
that gets us to our uh evolved part
which is basically just asking why did
this happen? Why did the price shoot up
like it did? um what caused people to
buy into the stock and make it
uh make it grow so much. Um so this is
where we can kind of talk a little bit
about um some
uh what are they called? Behavioral
finance. Yeah, behavioral finance uh
reality. Um so people like to buy things
uh can get drawn I I should say get
drawn into buying things um if a big
group of people are actually just buying
them. Uh there's a
there's a an or a proof called uh
hurting behavioral uh social proof. Um
this is when a bunch of people basically
say okay we're going to buy this stock
and drive the price up. Um and to do
that a bunch of people have to buy into
it. um buy into that stock. So, which is
exactly what happened here on Reddit.
People were saying, ""Well, this is a
great stock. We're going to buy into
it."" Uh, and the price shoots up. But
again, it's not something that's really
sustainable. Uh, especially with Reddit,
uh, they basically consider Jimmy a meme
stock, which means they're buying into
it more as a joke, but they also
expected big returns out of it. Um
there's also confirmation bias uh which
is when people focus only on news that
makes it sound like uh that basically
good news. So they expect that okay
because I'm only listening to Reddit has
or Reddit uh GME has shot up tound
120 bucks. It's going to stay there. So
I need to invest now because or it's
been shooting up so much. I'm going to
it's going to keep shooting up. So if
you had bought at it highest here at
120, you're going to lose money. But as
you can see, I guess now in the future,
you can see, but just seeing that it's
going up and not actually looking at the
reasons why it's going up. Um, so it's
always important to analyze why things
are happening and uh why a stock is
increasing or things like that. Um,
so that basically gives some of those uh
reasons for that. Um,
and then again, it was basically just a
VA volatile stock. Um, you shouldn't
have been expecting or people that were
buying into it shouldn't have been
expecting it to stay as high as it did.
But that's what happens when uh stock
explodes. People buy into it and they
think, well, I'm going to get rich quick
and buy it. Uh, if I buy it now, it's
going to increase because people are
talking about it so much and then I'll
sell it at its peak. But you don't know
when that peak is going to eventually
die. And if it dies, it might die. It
might drop off considerably like it did
with GameStop. Um which again afterwards
there were still pretty good profits
like way higher than it had been in the
past, but um not well enough. So finally
getting to sorry about that. uh getting
to synthesis. Um this is basically just
telling us um how our image theory uh
binds with our behavioral finance
reality. So our theory would tell us
that uh people are going to look at
historical data to make decisions.
They're going to look at publicly
available data and make smart choices.
Um a stock's not just going to increase
for no reason, you know. Um, but
behaviorali finance theory tells us that
people aren't they aren't machines.
They're not going to make decision
always make decisions based on what's
reasonable. Uh, they're going to see
things that they like, uh, things they
think may be funny. Uh, things they are
invested or like mentally invested, not
like with money invested, but they're
like, ""Oh, I want to see this do good,
so I'm going to put money into it, even
though it might not be the smartest
choice."" Uh, so I feel like that's a big
part. uh people not always making the
smartest choice but following their gut
rather than their minds. So uh yeah,
that's a big big reason why event like
this can happen where people buy into a
stock and shoot its price up even though
it has realistically no reason to
actually happen. Um so finally I think
there were a few yeah required analysis
uh verified the historical prices talked
about the market efficiency
uh could anal irrational investor have
profited systematically uh so
systematically no um that's when you
look at historical data like we were
talking about and say like for certainty
I could have made huge profits with this
um and again there's no way to actually
predict that as we figured out here uh
kind It happened spontaneously and um
yeah, maybe you did get lucky and had
money into it and it uh boomed, but
there's no way uh someone who actively
analyzes the market could have looked at
that and been like, ""Well, I'm going to
make a huge profit here."" Um so yeah
that that really a rational investor uh
unfortunately wouldn't have been able to
just look at and see but you know
uh there's plenty of other choices out
there. Uh compare efficient marketing to
observe behaviors did that um
observe anomalies. Yeah, kind of went
over that. So that's the analysis with
this situation with GME um the shorts
market squeeze.
Um, and yeah, again, kind of just a
random event that happened with a bunch
of people talking about it and shows how
the public uh and especially social
media with Reddit here because I feel
like this is one of the first instances
where it really shot up like that
because of a website like Reddit. Um,
but yeah, shows how a stock people can
group up and talk about things and make
a stock shoot up in price or blow up uh
for really no reason other than that
they find it funny or they want to uh
they just want to make the price higher.
So, yeah.",,0,1

Hi everyone and welcome to another
0:02
assignment. Um this time we're working
0:04
on session 8 market efficiency and
0:07
behavioral finance. So first let me go
0:10
through the assignment overview. So here
0:13
we are investigating the market
0:15
efficiency using um GME or GameStop um
0:20
short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a
0:23
case study. So um this analysis will
0:27
apply the driver framework as always to
0:29
empirically test the efficiency market
0:31
hypothesis or the EMH and assess the
0:35
role of behavioral finance in this
0:37
historic market an anomaly. Now for
0:40
stage one we began by defining the core
0:43
problem and we look over the um
0:46
assignment overview in order to do this.
0:48
So, did the GME event violate the
0:51
efficient market hypothesis? And our
0:53
research question became, can the GME
0:56
price movement be explained by rational
0:59
models or does it require behavioral
1:01
finance explanations? The critical first
1:04
step was verifying the stated historical
1:06
facts. And we discovered a major
1:09
discrepancy. The claim that GME traded
1:12
at 0.04
1:14
dollars in August 2020 is incorrect.
1:18
Historical data shows that GME traded in
1:20
the range of $1.04
1:23
to $1.67
1:26
with a split adjusted um during that
1:29
month. This correction was vital for
1:31
accurate analysis and you were able to
1:34
identify the need for GME and S&P 500
1:37
price data from 2020 to 2021 to conduct
1:41
a formal event study methodology. Now
1:44
for our represent stage, we were able to
1:46
create a visual um for this entire stage
1:49
two and here we formalized our
1:52
analytical plan. We chose the event
1:55
study meth methodology as our primary
1:59
tool. Um and we plan to test the EMH by
2:02
calculating
2:04
um the EMH by calculating abnormal
2:07
returns or AR. And first what we did is
2:11
we defined an estimation window. So that
2:15
is from September 2020 to March 2021.
2:18
And then we use the cap and market model
2:21
to estimate GM's normal relationship
2:23
with the market. And that's alpha and
2:25
beta. So um that would be 250 training
2:29
days ending 60 days before event. So
2:32
that would be about
2:35
um about that. and also July 2020 to
2:39
March 2021 as the event window. And for
2:44
um number three, our step three is we
2:46
plan to calculate the cumulative and
2:48
normal returns or car during key periods
2:52
such as the September 2020 Ryan Cohen
2:55
news um and the January 2021 squeeze
2:59
peak to test the EMH forms. But we also
3:02
have in this stage um all the equations
3:05
that we're going to use as seen here um
3:08
in our visual and we also have that
3:11
violation test uh structured over here
3:14
before you move into the implement
3:16
stage. So now um let's go to our Python
3:19
code. So for our Python code, uh we
3:23
executed this through the Y Finance or
3:26
the Yahoo Finance library to download
3:28
data and run an OS regression over the
3:31
estimation window that we determined to
3:33
determine our market model parameters.
3:36
So if you run this, it'll run in the
3:39
back end and we run this um Python code
3:43
as well. Uh it shows that the simulated
3:46
parameters are as follows, right? And
3:49
with this our alpha is02608
3:57
and our beta is 1.0252.
4:00
So using these parameters we calculated
4:03
the daily um AR and car throughout the
4:06
event and we also created a graph for
4:11
that. We plotted one and loading this.
4:14
This is what the graph looks like after
4:16
all the calculations that we did for the
4:18
first 10 days of the event window. Um,
4:20
and this is the result.
4:23
As you can see here, the empirical
4:25
evidence is stark. Um, the car for the
4:28
peak month of January 2021 over here. um
4:34
this was approximately
4:37
1750%
4:39
and this massive return cannot be
4:41
explained by GME's systematic risk alone
4:44
leading directly to our validation phase
4:47
and for stage four the validate um what
4:51
we are doing here is we are confirming
4:53
our findings from the implement stage
4:55
through statistical scrutiny so the
4:58
17500
5:00
uh 1750% cent car is highly
5:03
statistically significant leading to the
5:06
definitive rejection of the null
5:08
hypothesis um which is that GME's
5:11
returns were normal. So this validates
5:14
the violation of two EMH forms um which
5:18
is first the weak form EMH violation.
5:20
The extreme price movement was preceded
5:22
and accompanied by a 10-fold increase in
5:25
retail trading volume. And this also
5:27
suggests that momentum traders who
5:29
tracked volume and short interest um
5:32
like past trading data could have
5:34
systematically
5:36
profited contradicting the weak form.
5:38
And then for the semi- strong form EMH
5:40
violation, the market's explosive and
5:43
highly exaggerated reaction to public
5:45
information um was delayed and
5:47
non-fundamental. So that rejects the
5:50
semi strong form.
5:52
And with that um our evolve stage
5:55
includes um applying our findings to
5:58
broader theory. So we conclude um that
6:03
the anomaly is best explained by um by
6:08
behavioral finance. So number one
6:11
behavioral biases right we saw clear
6:14
hurting behavior and overconfidence from
6:16
retail traders which is fueled by social
6:18
media coordination. Number two there's
6:20
limits to arbitrage. Um this mispricing
6:24
persisted because rational investors
6:26
like for hedge funds were preventing um
6:30
were prevented from correcting it due to
6:32
noise trader risk and the
6:34
extraordinarily high cost of borrowing
6:36
for shortselling. So this is the
6:38
mechanism that allows the anomaly to
6:41
exist and the policy implement
6:43
implementation is that the event
6:45
highlighted market microstructure
6:47
failures especially the dangerous level
6:49
of short interest exceeding 100% and the
6:53
need for clearer regulations regarding
6:54
trading restrictions implemented by
6:57
brokers during volatility.
7:00
So with all of this we synthesize our
7:03
conclusion. Again, GME was a powerful if
7:06
high-risk reputation of the strict forms
7:09
of the EMH in the short term and the
7:12
profits achieved were expost and highly
7:15
speculative, not systematic or reere
7:19
risk-free. While the market was
7:22
irrational, profiting was a gamble
7:25
basically. And this confirms that while
7:26
the EMH is flawed in the face of
7:29
behavioral anomalies, it still provides
7:31
a robust framework for long-term risk
7:34
adjusted investment. So to conclude, GME
7:38
is basically serving as a critical case
7:40
study um demonstrating the real reality
7:43
of limits to arbitrage in preventing the
7:46
instantaneous correction of gross
7:48
mispricing driven by behavioral f
7:51
hurting. So that's it for session eight.
7:54
Um hopefully this was helpful in terms
7:56
of investigating our case study. Um and
7:59
that's also what I learned throughout u

",FALSE,1,"INTRODUCTION
""Did GameStop's 2021 short squeeze break the Efficient Market Hypothesis? Or does behavioral finance explain everything? Today, I'll walk you through a rigorous DRIVER analysis—Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve, Reflect—investigating whether markets were efficient or irrational. We'll also correct a critical data error in the original assignment. Let's dive in.""

D — DEFINE (Fact-Check!)
""Stage One: Define and Discover. Before any analysis, we verify our facts. The assignment stated GME traded at four cents in August 2020. However, upon checking Yahoo Finance—GME actually traded between four dollars and five-sixty, with an average of four-thirty. That's a hundred times higher. This was likely a typographical error—four-point-zero-zero misread as zero-point-zero-four—or confusion with split-adjusted prices from 2022. Professional correction: all subsequent analysis uses actual trading prices verified from multiple sources.

Our research question: Did GME violate weak, semi-strong, or strong-form EMH, or can behavioral finance and limits to arbitrage explain the dynamics? We analyze four critical events: Ryan Cohen's stake in September 2020—expected positive; Robinhood's trading restriction January twenty-eighth—expected negative; the Congressional hearing in February—expected neutral; and the second wave surge on February twenty-fourth—expected positive.""

R — REPRESENT
""Stage Two: Represent—designing our framework before coding. We use an event study with three window sizes: short, medium, and long, centered on each event. For normal returns, we estimate a CAPM model: Return equals alpha plus beta times market return, using an estimation window of 120 to 21 days before each event.

Abnormal Return is actual minus expected. Cumulative Abnormal Return sums these over the event window. We test significance using t-statistics. For behavioral analysis, we compute volume ratios for overconfidence, return autocorrelation for herding, and rolling correlations for mental accounting. Everything's designed on paper first—no coding yet.""

 I — IMPLEMENT (KEY RESULTS)
""Stage Three: Implementation. Using Python with yfinance, pandas, and statsmodels, we load five years of data and estimate CAPM parameters. Beta ranges from 1.23 to 1.45—GME is more volatile than the market.

Now the key results: Cumulative Abnormal Returns. Ryan Cohen announcement: plus twenty-two percent over ten days—highly significant. Market underreacted initially. Robinhood restriction: minus forty-two percent—the largest magnitude, confirming a severe supply-demand shock. Congressional hearing: no significant effect, already priced in. Second wave: plus thirty-four percent, showing herding behavior persisted weeks later.

Behavioral evidence is striking. Volume spiked to fifteen times baseline—textbook overconfidence. Return autocorrelation jumped to 0.34—strong momentum from herding. Correlation with the S&P 500 dropped to 0.12—GME decoupled, treated as a separate mental account. And volatility was 30% higher on down days—loss aversion in action.""

V — VALIDATE
""Stage Four: Validation—testing robustness. Do our findings hold with different assumptions? First, alternate event windows: results stable across short, medium, and long windows—same sign and significance. Second, alternate market proxies: beta estimates stable whether we use S&P 500, Russell 2000, or Nasdaq. Third, outlier treatment: winsorizing extreme returns changes CAR by less than eight percent—not driven by outliers. Fourth, mean-adjusted model: directionally consistent with CAPM. Verdict: All four checks passed. Findings are robust and reliable.""

E — EVOLVE
""Stage Five: Evolve—what does this mean for investors? Our recommendation: a barbell strategy. Eighty to ninety percent in passive index funds because EMH holds on average, over time. Ten to twenty percent in selective active strategies targeting extreme behavioral events—but only when you can identify microstructure dislocations, limits to arbitrage, or herding with volume over ten-x baseline.

Active versus passive? Both have merit. In normal markets, passive wins—markets are efficient enough. In extreme events like GME, selective active may add value, but ex-ante identification is the challenge. You knew GME would squeeze? No. You knew when? No. Ex-post, it's obvious. Ex-ante, it's a lottery ticket.""

R — REFLECT (EMH VERDICT)
""Stage Six: Reflection and synthesis. Did GME violate EMH? Yes, temporarily. Weak-form: momentum persisted. Semi-strong: slow incorporation of news, significant post-announcement drift. Strong-form: no insider trading detected—this one held. But—and this is critical—EMH still holds 'on average, over time.' GME is an exception, not the rule, affecting less than 0.01% of securities.

Why did it happen? Behavioral biases—overconfidence, herding, anchoring—amplified by limits to arbitrage: short interest over 100%, borrow fees astronomical, trading halts preventing correction. Shleifer and Vishny were right: arbitrage is risky and costly, not instantaneous. Ex-ante versus ex-post matters. Ex-post, buying at four dollars and selling at four-eighty-three was a twelve-thousand-percent return. Ex-ante, which of 3,000 small-caps would squeeze? Unknowable.""

CONCLUSION
""To summarize: We corrected the data—GME was four dollars, not four cents. We found significant abnormal returns violating semi-strong EMH temporarily. Behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage explain the dynamics. For investors: passive core, selective active edge. For researchers: EMH is a useful approximation, not absolute truth. Markets are mostly efficient, most of the time—GME is the exception that proves the rule. Thank you.""

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Yanxi Liu, and this is my Session 8 Assignment. I followed the DRIVER framework. At the Define and Discover step, the 2020–2021 GameStop short squeeze represents one of the most striking real-world challenges to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which claims that asset prices fully reflect all available information. The primary objective of this study was to analyze whether the GME phenomenon violated any of the three forms of market efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong, and to explore whether behavioral finance offered a better explanation of investor behavior during this extraordinary event. In early 2021, GameStop's stock price surged from under five dollars to nearly $483, driven not by fundamental valuation but by a wave of coordinated retail investor activity, most notably through Reddit's or Wall Street community. This collective action, targeting hedge funds that had heavily shorted the stock, created an unprecedented and self-reinforcing price escalation that defied conventional financial logic. The first step in the analysis was to verify a factual claim provided in the assignment: that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020. Historical data from Yahoo Finance was retrieved, and the findings immediately contradicted this statement. The adjusted prices for August 2020 showed that the stock opened at $1.00, reached a monthly low of $0.84, and closed at $1.65. Since all Yahoo Finance data are automatically adjusted for corporate actions, including GameStop's 4-for-1 stock split in 2022, the verified low of $0.84 confirmed that the $0.04 figure was false by a factor of twenty-one. This verification ensured that all subsequent analysis proceeded from accurate data rather than from a misleading premise. At the Represent stage, the analytical design followed a four-phase framework corresponding to the three forms of the EMH and the integration of behavioral finance. In the weak-form test, GME and S&P 500 data were downloaded, and daily logarithmic returns were computed to test whether past prices contained predictive power for future returns. If price movements are predictable, it implies that past information has not been fully incorporated into current prices, violating the weak form of efficiency. In the semi-strong form test, a market model was built using the CAPM to establish GameStop's normal relationship with the broader market. The estimation window spanned August through October 2020, representing a pre-event baseline period, while the event window captured the peak squeeze period from January to February 2021. Abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns were then calculated to determine whether public information, such as short interest and social media discussions, was already reflected in market prices. Finally, the strong-form test and behavioral analysis examined whether insider information and psychological biases played a role, using qualitative evidence from public disclosures, Reddit discussions, and trading patterns. At the Implement step, when the analysis was executed, the data passed all integrity checks, and the Python-based system successfully retrieved and visualized the relevant historical data. The factual verification confirmed that the $0.04 price claim was false, with the actual split-adjusted low being one dollar. The weak-form test produced an autocorrelation value of approximately –0.0035, suggesting minimal serial correlation in GME's daily returns. Although this might superficially appear consistent with weak-form efficiency, the visual inspection of price and volume charts told a very different story. From late 2020 through early 2021, the price followed a classic ""rocket ship"" pattern; past price increases seemed to generate further buying pressure, creating clear evidence of momentum. In other words, while the numerical test suggested weak correlation, investor behavior and visual trends revealed that recent gains strongly influenced expectations of future gains, indicating a practical violation of the weak form of market efficiency. The semi-strong form test, represented by the cumulative abnormal returns, provided even clearer evidence of inefficiency. If markets were semi-strong efficient, cumulative abnormal returns would hover randomly around zero, as new public information would already be incorporated into prices. Instead, the CAR line displayed a massive, explosive upward movement, peaking at more than 200% during the height of the squeeze. This result showed that the market failed to efficiently process widely available public information, such as Reddit discussions, short-interest data, and trading restrictions by brokers like Robinhood. The CAR pattern thus confirmed a strong violation of semi-strong form efficiency. Even though some minor variations in alpha and beta could occur if the estimation window changed, no reasonable market model could ever have predicted the extraordinary returns observed during this event. Let's move into the Validate. In the strong-form and behavioral analysis, the investigation found that certain actors may have benefited from private information. Ryan Cohen's acquisition of a 13% stake in GameStop, later revealed to have been purchased before public disclosure, demonstrated that insider knowledge played a material role in anticipating the firm's strategic transformation. This directly contradicts the strong form of EMH, which asserts that even private information is fully reflected in prices. Beyond insider activity, behavioral finance offered a more compelling lens through which to interpret the overall market behavior. Reddit posts and memes such as ""Apes together strong"" and ""Diamond hands"" exemplified herding, overconfidence, and confirmation bias. Retail investors anchored their beliefs to arbitrary price targets, often $1,000 per share, with no connection to GameStop's fundamental value, which most analysts placed between $10 and $40. The limits to arbitrage also played a crucial role. Rational investors and institutional short-sellers were unable to correct the mispricing because of extreme constraints: short interest reached 140% of the float, borrowing costs were astronomical, and margin calls forced liquidations that further fueled the rally. The mechanics of the ""gamma squeeze"" in the options market amplified volatility even further. These structural limitations, combined with behavioral contagion through social media, created a perfect storm that disconnected price from any semblance of fundamental valuation. The next step is the Evolve. The results of the analysis demonstrate that markets can experience severe, though temporary, breakdowns in efficiency. The GameStop episode was not just a random anomaly; it was a vivid manifestation of how information asymmetry, structural constraints, and collective psychology can interact to destabilize price discovery. For most investors, the event reinforces the importance of passive, diversified investing strategies. Attempts to ""catch"" the next GameStop are essentially speculative gambles, as even being fundamentally correct, as in the case of hedge funds betting against GME, offers no protection if timing and market sentiment turn against you. From a behavioral perspective, the GameStop event revealed the unprecedented power of social media to coordinate and amplify retail investor sentiment. Platforms like Reddit became arenas of collective action, where emotional narratives overpowered rational analysis. This created a feedback loop in which rising prices validated the community's confidence, encouraging further buying and pushing prices even higher. The event also prompted major policy discussions about transparency in short-interest reporting, the ethics of ""payment for order flow"" practices, and the dangers of gamified trading platforms that blur the line between investing and entertainment. Here is the Reflect. The study concludes that while the Efficient Market Hypothesis remains a useful model for understanding long-term price behavior in most markets, the GameStop saga proves that markets are not perfect machines but human systems subject to emotion, coordination, and structural fragility. Both the weak and semi-strong forms of EMH were clearly violated, and the behavioral finance framework provides a far better explanation of what occurred. Before the event, no rational investor could have systematically profited; those who did either acted on insider knowledge or participated in irrational speculation. Looking back after the fact, many claim they ""should have bought,"" but this hindsight bias merely illustrates how unpredictable and psychologically driven the market became. The GameStop short squeeze stands as a powerful reminder that efficiency is not an absolute condition but a fragile equilibrium. When social media coordination, extreme short exposure, and widespread behavioral biases converge, markets can detach entirely from fundamental value. The case serves as both a cautionary tale and an enduring lesson in modern finance: markets may correct themselves over time, but in the short run, they are vulnerable to human emotion, narrative contagion, and the limits of rational arbitrage.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Damian
Lopez and this is the Section 6
assignment, the Market Efficiency
Investigation. The overview is that
I need to investigate market efficiency
using the GameStop short squeeze event
of 2020 to 2021. As the case study,
I need to verify the accuracy of stated facts,
analyze price behavior relative to efficient
market hypothesis predictions and evaluate
whether market anomalies constitute evidence
against market efficiency or the or if
it can be explained with existing frameworks
the first step is to verify the statement
game stop traded at zero zero dollars and four
cents in August of 2020 which I can show
that that statement is incorrect because in
August of 2020 it was trading between a dollar
and one cent and a dollar and 79 cents
with the adjustment closing of being a dollar
sixty-seven for August of 2020. So that
statement is incorrect. And to determine the
appropriate communication approach for correcting
the professor, I guess I could
say something in an email or something
that I was working on the case GameStop
case study and I noted noticed that this
statement was incorrect I checked the historical
price data using the Yahoo Finance
website and I checked that the adjusted
close in August of 2020 was a $1.67 and
that it was roughly started it opened at
was it a dollar and one cent and it closed
at $1.79 and that the driver assignment
requires verifying historical claims
before proceeding I just wanted to
confirm whether we should treat that
four cent figure as a typo or if it was
intended as a different data source let's
see some of the timelines key data
points and then required analysis is to verify
all these stated historical price data
and document corrections test which former market
efficiency the week semi strong or strong
was violated evaluate whether rational
investors could have profited systematically
compare efficient market hypothesis prediction
to observe behavior and assess behavior
finance explanations for observed anomalies
on to the define and discover essentially I
had a research question which was did the
GameStop event violate the market efficiency
what market efficient market hypothesis
which is false and I showed that using the
Yahoo Finance website the onto the represent
stage I can show using the code added the estimation window
has been roughly D minus 250 to the
minus 31 trading days which we use
as a market model to compute the of
abnormal returns, test the cumulative
abnormal returns, run robustness
checks, and integrate behavior and
evidence like social media activity and
short interest. onto the implement stage, which we have
the parameters at GameStop, SPY, the
start of January 1, 2020, ending in
December 31st, 2022. The estimation gap is 30, which was
before the event mmm and I had the
code the code AI fetches data the GME
from the finance Yahoo Finance download
it and the SPY edit here choose the primary
event and squeeze peak the estimation
window and then market model wanted it wanted
it to show the market model parameter, the
estimation windows. Also compute the
abnormal returns and the event study windows as
well as compute sample around the event and
then the t-test on the cumulative abnormal
returns at the event window using the standard
event study variance and then the variance of
the cumulative abnormal returns which are the
sum of the squared residential model
variance model times v1 plus 1 divided by the
number of estimated window and then also had
the AI code plot these results and then also
the create an output summary table which
include three outputs so here we can see the
just a close price spiking which is during
the squeeze peak and then then afterwards
you know going back down steadily to its
normal price here we have a little chart
showing the GME volume which also showing it
at the squeeze peak peak being at its maximum
and then eventually or almost immediately
dying down going back to its fairly
steady volume as well as the cumulative of
normal returns these are all the values
that we used or AI used using the Yahoo
Finance models the size and the speed of
the abnormal returns were inconsistent with
the efficient pricing which are based on the
public fundamentals which the event
drivers are extremely high short interest and
the retail coordination via the social
media and then the liquidity margin

Cato Institute Journal or this

and drastic increase in price and in return
volatility which was used by reddit the social
media platform a large it was used by or
initiated by a large amount of retail investors
using the Robin Hood financial platform and
after this or during this event Robin
Hood imposed trading restrictions based on
January 28th through the 29th which banned new
long positions in GameStop and other stocks
which it triggered a uproar and it obviously
retreated back from its January high some
recommendations include being more transparent

Hello, this is management 310 assignment 8. So our objective for this assignment is to investigate market efficiency

let's go ahead and set our goal. So the goal of this study is to test EMH by analyzing whether the price movements
0:23
during 20 to 2021 of GameStop reflected an informationational efficiency or displayed systematic inefficiencies. So
0:31
the analysis will assume public available price data captures all the relevant information and it's also
0:37
consistent with the EMH testing standards. We're also going to assume that any deviations from efficiency were
0:43
interpreted as potential behavioral or market anomalies rather than permanent
0:48
inefficiencies. As far as our benchmark plan, we're going to have to dive into some required

analysis. We're going to have to verify that all stated price data is correct. We're going to have to test market
1:00
efficiency and see if it was violated. We're going to have to evaluate whether rational investor investors could have
1:06
profited. We're going to see if the EMH predictions compare those to the
1:11
observed behavior and what actually happened. We're going to dive a little bit into the behavioral side and also see what market anomalies constitute
1:18
evidence against EMH. So the data that we are given is shown
1:24
here. So this is the original data that we are given. We are given an event timeline
1:29
along with some key data points that we'll dive more into later.
1:35
We are given the financial analysis requirements. So we have to do some market efficiency testing, some
1:40
behavioral finance analysis, investor profitability analysis and also some theoretical implications of EMH.
1:49
And then uh the last data we're given is some sources that we should refer to and
1:55
um also just some other data that we need to look into.
2:01
So let's go ahead and dive into our plan, our represent stage.
2:07
So for our represent stage, this is our framework and the route that I am going to be taking. So first we have to verify
2:13
that all the facts we are given are reliable and uh make sure that they are all accurate. From there, we're going to
2:19
analyze the price behavior relative to EMH and also find any violations. We're
2:24
going to test the weak form doing an OS regression and also showing an autocorrelation graph. From there, we're
2:32
going to look into the semi-strong efficiency testing. We're going to look at abnormal returns car and other events
2:38
that affected it. And then we're going to discuss the strong efficiency testing by just looking at the private information and how that affected
2:44
anything. Not going to be anything uh crazy modelwise. Uh we're also going to see the CAPM abnormal abnormal returns.
2:51
We're also going to look at the security market line to see where the return was in relative to the risk and then also
2:59
look at some predictability patterns and where that falls into the efficiency testing.
3:04
Uh thirdly, we're going to look at the event catalyst. So the timeline for that
3:10
is given as follows. So I'll talk about that a little bit briefly right here. The GameStop was near bankruptcy um in
3:17
August of 2020. um there was a lot of short interest within them. But later that year um the Chewy founder acquired
3:25
13% stake which kind of started everything. There was a Wall Street bets driven
3:30
surge and from there there were some federal restrictions and also Robin Hood restrictions that um put limits on
3:38
traders and what could be done during that time. After this whole event kind of settled down a little bit, there were
3:44
uh Congress hearings, but volatility was still all over the place. previous GameStop was still going up and down and
3:49
it's still well above the uh pre-squeeze price. And then as far as today goes, we
3:55
are in a stabilization period for it, but it's still well above the pre-squeeze as I have said.
4:01
So then from there, we're going to dive into the behavioral finance. So we're going to look into the biases and see if there are any behavioral patterns as far
4:06
as the social media. We're going to look at the limits to arbitrage and also assess market microstructure issues.
4:12
We're going to do that all within the model of Collab. Um, we're also going to look at a rational investor analysis.
4:18
We're going to see if there are any profit opportunities. We are going to see um if there are any information
4:25
advantages. We're also going to analyze the risk adjusted return and discuss the Xanti versus X post uh analysis types.
4:34
Lastly, we're going to conclude everything by comparing the efficient market hypothesis to the behavioral
4:41
finance framework. We're going to compare those and see how they differed to what actually played out to what we expected. We're then going to look at
4:47
the implications of passive versus active investment strategies with the EMH and also look at what policies were
4:53
implemented because of this event. So let's go ahead and dive into our
4:59
implement stage. Firstly, we have to look at the uh
5:05
quality of the data we are given. So the way I went about this is um collaborating with Gemini and chat GPT
5:12
to uh make a educated decision and I also went back and checked with real
5:17
data sources to make sure that it was correct as given. So uh most of the data is spot on. There
5:25
are some mistakes. So the first statement that uh GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is correct. They
5:31
were trading at a around um A14 cents at that time. There's also a small mistake
5:36
in saying that Ryan Cohen acquired a 13% stake in September 2020. Technically, he acquired that stake in December and only
5:43
require and only acquired a 10% stake in September. But um I would go about
5:49
correcting my professor in a private setting where I could undeniably prove that the statements are wrong based on
5:55
reliable sources and analysis. Um I would be very respectful going up to him and also address my findings in a
6:01
forward but approachable manner to make sure I don't come off as disrespectful. and uh also just make sure we're on the same page because it's a possibility
6:07
that I am wrong as well. So now let's actually dive into our model. We're going to start off by testing forms of
6:13
market efficiency and seeing which one was violated and how this plays into um
6:18
the short squeeze event. So my Gemini log was bugging but the
6:25
prompt that I used for uh Gemini which I used inside collab uh went as follows um
6:31
as shown here. So act as a tutor financial analyst and I gave it the goal that we need to do. We need to create a
6:38
Python notebook and uh I gave it all the data that it needed that we already went through. So I'm not going to repeat myself. But this is where most of the
6:45
important stuff comes in. So we're going to run an OS regression of the um the
6:50
week form to see if it was in violation or not. What an OS regression actually
6:56
is is it regresses today's return log over time. yesterday's return log and it
7:01
basically asked the question does past returns predict future returns.
7:06
So the second part kind of plays into that but then we are going to plot a 20day rolling autocorrelation of GME
7:14
which um will test for short-term predictability and we are going to be able to tell whether weak form
7:20
efficiency is violated because of that. So what week what weak form is going to
7:27
show is um whether past returns can predict future ones and and if past
7:35
returns do not show future returns then it would be in line with weak form
7:40
efficiency. So moving on to the semi- strong form
7:45
uh we're going to take a deeper look at the actual events that happened.
7:51
Uh so it's going to look at the event windows for each dates to see how abnormal the returns were to see what
7:57
actually happened. It's then going to plot that for um each window and show
8:03
the timing and the magnitude of the market reaction. Um then to move on to strong form we are
8:10
going to just briefly discuss whether inside activity or any other private
8:15
information influence the price. Um so the difference between semi-trong
8:22
would show us whether you can't it would basically say you can't consistently
8:28
outperform the market by using public information. So if we are seeing that we can then that would be in violation of
8:34
semi- strong and for strong even insiders with private information can't
8:39
earn abnormal returns. So if we see that insiders were making abnormal returns then it would be in violation of that.
8:45
So that's what we are going to be testing. Okay. So that was the prompt. Now let's dive into the actual model to answer um
8:54
two and four mostly shown here.
8:59
So it's going to set up the data. U nothing crazy just installing data.
9:05
Let's go ahead and dive into the OS regression. So, as we can see here, it's going to
9:11
calculate um it's going to sorry, it's going to
9:17
calculate yesterday's returns so-called uh with those logs and then from there
9:22
it's going to run the OS regression model within and then it's going to interpret the results based on the p
9:29
value shown down here. So, systematically this is kind of what we're looking at. It's not even the
9:35
behavioral side, but just based on the p values, the interpretation for this would be that it's consistent with week
9:42
four mar market efficiency because people wouldn't be able to predict today's returns based on yesterday. But
9:47
that's just what it says um systematically. So, we're going to have to look at the behavioral side of that to see if that changes our answer to if
9:55
weak form was uh was violated. But from here, we can also compare the p
10:01
value as I just said, but we can also look at R squared. So we can see that since it's virtually zero, no
10:06
predictability is really seen and uh truthfully I need to do a little bit more work with OS regressions to get um
10:13
a little bit better at them. But this is a first uh firsthand experience of me. So moving on, we're going to look at a
10:21
rolling 20-day autocorrelation of the returns. So this chart was plotted as so with a
10:28
rolling autocorrelation um code line given the um game log return
10:35
for uh the dates during 2020. But
10:40
we would expect this blue line to be closer to this red line kind of hugging randomly around zero. But instead we see
10:48
it going from negative to positive uh constantly which is suggesting that some short-term
10:54
predictability was possible um as there was momentum in the market and uh other social outside factors. So this is
11:01
definitely interesting to see. So as we can see the interpretation here it would
11:06
indicate short-term predictability and would be a violation of the weak form efficiency. So we have some conflicting
11:13
uh data data points with the OS regression and the autocorrelation. But
11:19
that's why we do these different tests and try to come down to what actually happened.
11:26
Lastly, kind of as a benchmark, we're going to see the um GameStop versus the SPY to get an idea of the abnormal
11:34
behavior during this time period. So, we can see that earlier in the year, GameStop was pretty close to bankruptcy,
11:42
um, if not almost there. And during the short squeeze event, we
11:47
can see how it just skyrocketed randomly. And when we take a look at the
11:53
SPY at the uh, same point, it might have even gone down at that point. So,
11:59
there's really not much correlation there. And it really just shows the abnormality of that event because there
12:04
was no significant market event that caused all stocks to go up and uh have
12:09
mass mass mass good breadth but instead we can see the abnormality um of this
12:16
short squeeze event. So this was a cool visualization for me to see. Um the prices are obviously vastly different
12:22
but that doesn't mean that the returns are um are the same. So from that analysis I would say there
12:30
is a violation of weak form uh market efficiency. Um maybe not as much systematically but
12:36
outside behaviors definitely caused um people to predict what the stock was
12:42
going to do. Um so it mostly plays into the behavioral side not as much as the fundamental side but uh as momentum kept
12:50
rising the stock also kept rising. So people were able to predict what it was going to do and they were also kind of
12:56
collaborating all with each other. So I would say that this is a violation of weak form efficiency
13:04
just based on that front. So now let's dive into the semi-strong efficiency. These are going to be more of the uh
13:11
public events that happened. So most of the code is going to be the
13:17
same for all of these. So I'm just going to go through one and um kind of just go
13:22
through the general idea. So basically it's going to define the event dates and the windows of what happened. So as
13:27
shown here, it's then going to filter the data for that exact time window. From there, it's going to calculate the
13:32
abnormal returns by looking at the GameStop returns and comparing it to the spy returns. Um from there, it's going
13:38
to calculate the cumulative abnormal returns uh through the car equation. And
13:44
then um it's going to go ahead and plot that on a graph. So around the time that
13:50
Cohen stake, the uh Chewy owner, bought the stock, we can see the abnormal
13:55
returns pretty much skyrocket. It they went from a little under 5% to close to
14:01
40% and above given that date. So we can see after this point it kind of stabled
14:08
out a tad bit, but it kept slowly climbing higher. The AI interpretation of this graph
14:15
shows that there's a suggestion of violation of semi- strong form efficiency,
14:21
but this one's a bit harder to say. Um, it is saying that a significant or sudden jump or decline around the event
14:28
date. We can see that around the event date it's not insanely not an insane
14:34
jump compared to you know what we were seeing here but it is definitely
14:40
possible that um other people knew about this and were able to profit from it. So
14:47
we'll leave it at that and dive into the next event which is the Reddit surge.
14:53
So this one I would say is in a bit more of a violation because there is a sudden
14:59
jump around the event date and a sudden decline. So we can kind of see before Wall
15:06
Street's bets got involved, it was a bit bland and then there was some hype and some talk about it and then they got
15:13
involved but from there it went um down a little bit and got a little bit more
15:19
volatile. So up and down, up and down. people were making small profits and also losing lots if you bought high.
15:26
But it's definitely interesting to see how the influx of retail trading was able to cause abnormal returns to
15:32
skyrocket and kind of stay relatively in the same area for some time afterwards.
15:40
Now let's go ahead and look at the congressional hearings which I think is the most the most interesting one. So
15:46
the abnormal returns sharply declined um along these hearings. So I would say
15:51
that it could suggest a violation of semi- strong form efficiency.
15:57
Once they imposed some restrictions and some limits to it, um it definitely scared traders away and uh returns
16:02
dropped as people were selling off and uh momentum started to die down a little bit. But even after the hearings, people
16:10
were able to make some uh some money off it because um after the 19th, pretty
16:16
much a day after the hearings, it skyrocketed back up. So volatility was definitely still all over the place and
16:24
uh it continues from there. So I would say that this is in violation
16:29
of semi- strong um efficiency because the markets were really reacting to sentiments and also a group of people
16:36
were um allowing the stock price to change dramatically and it wasn't a fundamental aspect that caused that.
16:44
So let's go ahead and dive into strong form efficiency. Um, as said before, this is going to kind of be more of a
16:50
discussion about what happened. So, as stated here, several factors point to a
16:55
violation of strong form uh a violation of strong form market efficiency. So, to
17:01
start, we can see that there are we can see that there was a consistent
17:06
buildup of short positions by hedge funds, which could have shown that there is some private information not being um
17:12
shared. Maybe people were kind of banking that they would go that they would go bankrupt. that's what was happening. Um, and then as far as the
17:20
analyst fundamentals go, um, it vastly exceeded the the estimates of 10 to 40
17:25
per share. You know, it went all the way close to 500. Um, I think it topped at 483 as showed here. But that definitely
17:33
goes to show that it was influenced by some private knowledge or group trading strategies and behavioral factors that
17:40
diverged it from its intrinsic value. And then um the retail trading increased
17:46
by tfold during its squeeze. People were really trying to get in on the action. Um so there were restrictions which
17:54
basically didn't let people trade and um other people didn't have those
17:59
restrictions. So definitely a violation of strong form efficiency there. So I
18:04
would say in all aspects there is a violation of all market efficiency when
18:09
looking at GameStop case during the during the short squeeze. But that assumption wouldn't be correct
18:16
without some sort of robustness check. So let's go ahead and dive into that. So what we're going to be showing here,
18:22
I'll kind of keep it short and sweet as it's a validation step. We're basically going to be comparing the returns
18:28
pre-squeeze and after squeeze. So kind of the same ideas. So we're going to be
18:35
looking at um a comparison of the OS regressions
18:40
and also be graphing the same autocorrelation um graphs to take a look at that.
18:46
And it's going to uh print all of that as shown here.
18:53
So we've already seen so we can see how the pre-queeze we are
19:00
hovering more around zero and um this really goes to show that yesterday's returns don't really um fall in with uh
19:08
today's returns and then for the post squeeze we saw this one earlier um the heavy volatility
19:15
and the short momentum spans where people were able to predict what was going to happen um within the price of
19:23
the market based on uh momentum and other outside factors. Now we can do a robustness check for the
19:29
semi-rong efficiency. We can kind of look at the exact same graph we were looking at earlier. So the GameStop
19:35
beforehand um not much abnormal return at all. You know people were getting the expected of
19:40
what they wanted and then from there the Reddit surge happened and cumulative abnormal return just skyrocketed. um
19:50
everyone was making return and it stayed at that point for a little bit while. So that's kind of the pre and post cool
19:56
visualization to see. And then as far as a robustness check for the uh strong
20:01
form, uh basically we did a quick analysis of the pre-queeze period um and
20:08
the postqueeze period to look at how private information affected this. And
20:13
in summary, we can see that it might have been vi violated pre-squeeze, but it was almost definitely uh violated in
20:21
the squeeze period. So after the squeeze happened,
20:27
we can see that it's not really just caused by typical insider information and people knowing what's going on. Instead, there is institutional private
20:33
strategies and vulnerabilities. So all those short positions that happened, they all went horrible and uh their
20:40
losses were were were miserable and then um there was also just extreme
20:47
diversions from the fundamental value of what was actually happening with inside the company. So that definitely played a
20:54
factor into it. And then uh as we talked about earlier, trading restrictions uh basically
21:02
affected all retail investors and maybe not institutional ones um as
21:07
aggressively. So based on our robustness check, I would still be on the same page
21:13
with uh the conductive analysis that I had with our EA EMH.
21:19
So now that answer two is fully answered, let's dive into four. So four is going to compare the predictions to
21:25
the observed behavior. This is going to be a little bit shorter because we pretty much already talked about everything that already happened. But
21:32
the weak form efficiency as we already said past return should not be able to predict future returns. Um and then
21:38
we've already talked about these other ones. But let's go ahead and compare our
21:44
predictions to what we actually saw. So what this code is going to do is basically just create a table and uh a
21:52
summary of what we expect and what we actually saw and if it was violated or
21:57
not. So we can see here weak form we can see
22:05
the prediction no predictive power from past returns. What actually happened? Well, we can see that there is
22:11
significant predictive power or power from the prior's day's return and it
22:16
deviated significantly from zero when we are looking at a rolling autocorrelation. So, conclusion, we would say that it was
22:24
efficient, but I do not agree with what the AI said here. I believe that um weak
22:30
form was uh violated based on that. So, I'm going to have to go ahead and fix my analysis right after that. That was an
22:35
error. I just caught it real quickly, but I don't really want to re-record the whole 20 minutes. So, sorry about that.
22:41
Um, let's move on to the semi strong. So, the instant and rational adjustment to public information. That's what we
22:46
should predict. But instead, what we saw was rapid price movements from public events happening and uh indicating that
22:53
there was overreaction rather than a rational incorporation of this information. So, we would say that it
22:59
was violated. strong form, no abnormal returns using private or uh public information, mostly private. But we can
23:07
see that it significantly deviated from its fundamental values and um as institutional positions uh fell short
23:15
and the trading restrictions that happened. You know, it all influenced the private information unequal access
23:20
to uh trading accessibility. So, we would go ahead and say that it was violated. So in short, could a rational investor
23:27
really have made money systematically during this short squeeze? Probably not.
23:33
In short, uh the market environment was dominated by, you know, extreme biases,
23:39
a lot of volatility, different risk from all over the place, trading frictions, and
23:46
it's just some just some crazy stuff happening in the market that no rational investor would really want to ever be
23:52
around. So, a lot of the um experimental investors and risky ones uh really
23:58
magnetized to GameStop during this time. But let's dive a little bit into why.
24:05
Firstly, uh if a rational investor wanted to calculate the sharp ratio because that's maybe what a rational
24:10
investor would do, we could see that this number is favorable as it's above one. But it would be considered
24:16
misleading because of its um unique nature of the event and the extreme
24:23
price movements and not abnormal returns and the unquantifiable risk. So it
24:29
really was not a sharp calculation for or just something that you should be
24:35
basing a lot of your research off of. So that being said, you can kind of move into the weak form efficiency uh semi-
24:44
strong and strong form efficiency uh arguments. a rational investor really could not
24:50
have used the uh past price or um the volume alone or the or the data alone to
24:57
um offer a uh systematic information advantage.
25:05
Um, as far as semi strong goes, there were maybe some exploitable
25:11
opportunities, but the speed and the magnitude and irrationality of everything around it probably would not
25:16
have been very attractive to a rational investor. And as the AI put it, it was speculative gambling or gambling. Can't
25:24
really talk today. Uh and then as far as the strong form
25:29
efficiency goes um they obviously weren't accessible to all traders and um
25:36
the overall conclusion is that a uh typical rational investor really could
25:41
not have translated this into a practical investment strategy. So X anti versus X post is really just
25:48
the before and after analysis. We can see that um we talk about how it
25:54
was not generally predictable by an X anti- um analysis due to just the
26:00
unprecedented nature of the event and the gains only became noticeable after
26:06
um in an expost analysis. So
26:11
in short, no. A rational investor could not have saw this coming and uh made
26:17
good profit off of it based on um fundamental resources.
26:23
Now let's dive into the fifth step of our required analysis. Let's dive into the behavioral finance explanations.
26:32
So firstly um I imported some information into the AI and we had to
26:37
identify the behavioral biases that were going on. So firstly there was a lot of overconfidence in the market. There were
26:43
a lot of people who thought they would make a lot of money especially in uh Wall Street bets as they uh came together to um make this happen.
26:52
But on the flip side, a lot of institutional investors were uh very confident that GameStop would go
26:57
bankrupt and their short positions would be profitable. So there was a lot of overconfidence on both sides which uh
27:03
kind of collided and clashed. Um this event is a prime example of hurting. Um
27:10
everybody saw that it was happening and everyone just ran towards it and um definitely definitely amplified the
27:17
momentum of the stock. there's a fear of missing out. Uh, you know, seeing that other people are making crazy returns,
27:22
you might want to get in on that, too. So, that was definitely a behavioral aspect. Anchoring. Um, as far as that
27:28
goes, investors often anchor their decisions to a specific piece of information. So
27:34
if they trusted people in the Wall Street bets and what they were saying or on the flip side the institutional investors
27:40
um there was a lot of anchoring going on and people didn't really know
27:46
didn't I mean they they trusted what they knew but it wasn't exactly reliable
27:51
in the long run in hindsight. So lossion this bias suggests that um
27:58
investors feel the pain of losses more acutely than the pleasure for uh equivalent gains. So people don't want
28:04
to lose at all, but if they make a ton, they probably don't really care as much, which is a it's a weird behavioral
28:10
phenomenon. And then mental accounting is uh trying to treat money differently depending on its source or intended use.
28:16
So people might have seen this as like a gamble or a play money. Um so that definitely played into it as well. So
28:21
now that we have those behavioral biases identified, let's look at the social media patterns that happened. We can see
28:26
that uh Wall Street Bets amplified the sentiment and the communication as they posted memes and discussed rapidly and
28:33
uh rumors and trading strategies to um make all this money and collectively
28:38
they did it and coordinated buying. Um in this effort we saw it skyrocket and
28:44
um the action was explicitly aimed at squeezing the short sellers. This demonstrates the behavioral drive beyond
28:51
the uh fundamental investment aspects. So behavioral finance definitely plays a huge part into the markets nowadays.
28:58
And then as far as the actual price dynamics goes, we can see that in increased volatility and non-fundamental pricing within the stock and then also
29:04
extreme trading restrictions as we've talked about earlier.
29:11
Let's talk about the limits to arbitrage real quick. So limits to arbitrage refers to the factors that prevent rational investors from fully exploiting
29:17
perceived mispricings in the market. So in a perfectly efficient market, any deviation would be immediately
29:22
corrected. But in reality, there's a lot of practical barriers that make it even impossible for mispricings to persist.
29:30
We can see that there's fundamental risk and uh you know, obviously people holding the short positions and it um
29:36
there was a lot of mispricing already. So moving on to the noise trader risk.
29:42
There's a lot of there's a lot of people who invested because of stuff they heard and rumors
29:47
that they didn't even know if it was true. So that's um that's where the limits to arbitrage also plays into
29:53
that. And then um there was also commission cost for um
29:59
for the large influx of uh trading happening in the market. So there was a high cost of borrowing from people
30:05
trying to get money to get in on this limited share availability, the market
30:10
impact and obviously a trading restriction. So in summary, the uh price obviously fundament or deviated from its
30:17
fundamental value. But um as far as the limits to arbitrage go uh this basically allowed for extreme
30:23
mispricings to persist and people take advantage of those. So let's dive down into the market micro structure issues.
30:31
Uh this is basically going to look at the specific issues of what happened to GameStop and the overall market during
30:38
the uh short squeeze. So the first uh microructure issue was the liquidity fragmentation. It was
30:45
basically really hard to see what was happening to all the trades because they were being spread across everywhere. Um
30:51
secondly, there was order book imbalances meaning that uh
30:56
meaning that there was sustained buying pressure from retail investors while overwhelming uh pressure in the sell side um created the imbalances for uh
31:04
more buy orders than sell orders at various price levels which can uh lead to rapid price accelerations and that's
31:10
what we saw. price discovery challenges. Um we see that the um extreme volatility
31:18
and the technical dynamics meant that GameStop's price oftenly diverge from its fundamental value. So it made it
31:25
difficult for participants to gauge the true underlying value of the stock.
31:30
And then um as far as the impact of the settings train restrictions, you know, this obviously impacted investors itself, but it al also impacted the uh
31:37
company because it uh limited the purchase of GameStop shares and um it took some of the buying pressure off
31:43
from a significant segment of the market. And then after this there was um you
31:49
know changes in margin requirements basically meaning that uh which basically means the minimum amount
31:55
of equity that you have to have. uh it was changing within uh brokers and also within hedge funds holding positions in
32:02
uh GameStop. So all these microructure issues transformed into transformed the
32:08
stock into a a battleground as the AI put it where um vulnerabilities
32:14
were uh seen definitely. But to summarize what we kind of talked
32:19
about, we can see we can see how the GameStop event serves
32:25
as a u a really cool case study kind of intertwining behavioral finance, social
32:30
media, market microstructure weaknesses, and um a bunch of other factors that uh led to this uh short squeeze happening.
32:39
So all in all, the biggest contributing factor to um GameStop rising was really just the behavioral finance. Obviously,
32:45
there's the buy side and sell side imbalances, but in order to really start that, it all started with people coming
32:51
together to uh mass buy the stock. So, that's definitely really cool just to see because it obviously doesn't happen
32:57
often at all. And um obviously raised questions that uh the government had to
33:04
look into because this couldn't keep happening if the markets wanted to try
33:09
to stay efficient. Um, but to basically summarize the
33:15
entire behavioral",,,
section, the investor the investor behavior was less driven by fundamentals and more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:21:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
psychology and social influence as I've uh said before and the behavioral biases cause prices to deviate sharply um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
showing how emotion and crowd dynamics can temporally override market efficiency. So now let's dive into six.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:35:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's evaluate whether market analies um constitute evidence against market efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:40:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So what is a market anomaly uh an anomaly? Sorry, I'm having a hard time saying that. Basically, it's a pattern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:46:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of deviation um in returns that seems to contradict EMH. So we have momentum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:52:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
effect, which basically is the phenomenon where stocks that have performed well in recent past tend to continue for performing well. We have a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33:58:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
value effect for the tenure for value stocks to outperform growth stocks. We have the size effect which um small cap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:05:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stocks tend to outperform large cap stocks over long base periods. We have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:10:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calendar anomalies such as the January effect or the holiday effect like higher returns during holidays and higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:15:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns in January. Uh then we have the asset substitution problem which comes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:20:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
into play as it's not a traditional market an uh anomaly but it can lead to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:27:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a mispricing and inefficient capital allocation but it occurs when a firm's in financial distress and uh it takes on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:33:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly risky projects to benefit shareholders at the expense of bond holders. So this can lead to the firm's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:39:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equity being overvalued um to its true risk profile. But in conclusion, there's um these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
market anomalies constitute significant evidence against all forms of uh the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34:53:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EMH. But to summarize it, the market anomalies don't won't really necessarily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:01:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disprove market efficiency, but instead it's going to challenge its completeness. So under the em EMH we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:09:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
know that consistent excess returns shouldn't exist once fully in once the market fully reflects information and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:15:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's all priced in but as we can see the um an anonymies that we have seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:23:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um these can create temporary inefficiencies like in the instance for GameStop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and um it indicates that all markets are not perfectly efficient at all times but rather adaptably inefficient which I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:35:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think is a great way to think about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:41:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But all this was made uh with the help of Gemini. So it started with the prompt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that I showed in the beginning. Sorry that I just realized I wasn't really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:53:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
showing the Gemini prompt all along. So I went ahead and told it its goal and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35:59:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had it create each section. And within each section, I would go ahead and edit it to have the things that I wanted in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:06:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it if it was wrong or um have it corrected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And um this is my uh first time really building,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:19:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the um model like this. So I think that this was a uh great learning opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:25:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to uh kind of reflect back on it. I really learned a lot about markets and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:31:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how behavioral finance plays into it. I think the efficient market hypotheses are super interesting and I'll be doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:38:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some outside research about that and how it plays into um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:43:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the uh nowadays market since we are in a very interesting time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:49:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36:56:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but to finally conclude, let's go ahead and answer a few last lingering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:01:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
questions. So how does this affect passive versus active investment strategies and how does it integrate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:08:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
into uh both of them? So, you know, a passive investment strategy would just be like uh performing or um investing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:15:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
into a index such as the S&P 500 and holding it for a long-term growth. An active and an active investment strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:22:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be trying to outperform the market by actively managing a portfolio and buying and selling at a more consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:27:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basis. But, um as far as the relationship to the studying shows, we see that it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:34:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
challenges the passive strategies underlying assumptions. So we can see that um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:42:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can see that with these abnormal returns driven by public information, this this can this can really um affect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:49:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
passive investors because if they're not looking at markets at all time, it could really affect their portfolio and also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37:54:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have them lose a lot of money. But that's why divers diversification also comes into play. And it's definitely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting because if extreme mispricings can occur, does that imply that the market represented as an index,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:06:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is also suscept sus susceptible to uh such dislocations?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So definitely uh challenge that. And then as far as the active strategy, you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:18:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
know, it could be both a confirmation of existence for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:23:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh you know, doing this active strategy. definitely would make you feel better if you saw this coming and uh you were able,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to make returns off it but at the same time it also provides a cautionary tale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:35:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um it can show that markets can be profoundly inefficient and no matter what research you do it could be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:40:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just based on behavioral aspects. So definitely very interesting to look into the passive and active sides of this. Um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:48:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to actually compare the EMH to the behavioral finance comparison as we said in our represent stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38:55:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As we said before they're in informally orformationally um efficient and they're also adaptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:02:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we can see that efficient market hypothesis failed largely to account for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:08:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the the GameStop short squeeze. the market really didn't have that priced in. So, it didn't really think that it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:14:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that could happen and uh you know it obviously did happen. So, there was a swift return to um to those investors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:22:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But where behavioral finance helped provide a more comprehensive understanding because if we only looked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:29:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the fundamentals of this, I don't think we'd be able to understand why this happened and what really happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:34:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general. So the behavioral factors are obviously more important, but it explained why um it explained how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:41:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emotional responses and cognitive bias biases can um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
demonstrate how collective irrationality can uh dominate market forces and then um override um efficiency in a market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39:57:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But as as shown here, the GME event showcased almost entirely is explained by the behavioral finance principles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:05:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To kind of move more into that, we can see um that market inefficiencies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
persist in markets mostly due to the factors that prevent prices from always perfectly reflecting all available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:18:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information. So behavioral bi biases and whatnot like the limits to arbitrage and the maros market structure issues that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:25:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we saw earlier. So if these behavioral biases do continue, if people are going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:30:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
continue to hurt, if people are going to continue to invest because of FOMO, then those inefficiencies can persist. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:36:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's mostly just due to behavioral biases, uh which is pretty interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:41:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But lastly, what after this whole event ended, what happened? What what policies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:47:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were implemented into this? So what happened because of this event?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:52:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is more transparency in um short selling. So we can see that policy discussions have centered in more in um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40:59:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mandating more frequent and public disclosure on short interest data. So um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:05:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this short squeeze doesn't really happen as often or if ever again. Uh broker imposed trading restrictions. We can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the policy aims to clarify the authority of brokers to impose such restrictions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then the rules in social media and financial markets. Um, we can see how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:22:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regulators are are exploring to monitor and potentially regulate online financial disclosure without infringing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:28:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on speed on free speech to educate investors about the risk of uh what's happening when investing. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:37:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so this last one I don't think is really going to be possible in now a day time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:43:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because uh people can get information to each other very quickly and I think hurting will continue to override that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:51:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So definitely a uh very interesting way to see how policy implications have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41:57:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changed based off the short squeeze event and how it has um changed the uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42:04:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient market hypothesis and some way to uh make you think about it a little bit differently because if you don't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42:11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think about the behavioral aspects then um it's in violation of the efficient market hypothesis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",False,1,Hi there. I'm Antha and this is my",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
session 8 video. Um, I might be checking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
back and forth whether the video is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
working or not, but I'm excited to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
into my session 8 video assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Essentially, this assignment uses an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event study methodology to analyze the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020 2021 GameStop short squeeze. and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's going to determine whether GME's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price behavior violated the fetant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
market hypothesis the EMH by examining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal returns trading volume and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavioral dynamics around the event. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting right into it, we are looking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like I said at the GME market efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event study and we're going to be using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the driver framework and the analyst was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Gemini model as the class asks us to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use and so this script essentially will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at a CAPM based event study to test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the market efficiency and this includes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the critical data verification the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volume analysis the statistical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
validation as well and it's going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also check the robustness on from the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation windows that were provided.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So there are a bunch of libraries that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have to import for this and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
libraries are helpful for the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
handling aspect of it, the stats aspect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and for the plotting of our data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
visualization that I'll show you guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
later. So essentially we have finance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this is used to get the historical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock and the index data. So this is for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME, S&P 500 etc. We also import pandas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and so this is for the data frames the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data structures that we have and this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
typically also used in finance. We have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
numpy which we've been using pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot and this is for the numerical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
operations that we do. Um and I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a couple log returns as well in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this code. We have the stat models API,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and so this is used for regression and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we use this for the CAPM estimation. Um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we also have skippy for stats and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this again is for statistical functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the t test and then we have map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plot lib and this is used for plotting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and for the data visualization. So here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have the key parameters. So we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ticker GME and this defines the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security under investigation and then we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the market proxy the GSPC and this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the ticker for the S&P 500 index. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so our baseline estimation window is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
approximately 120 days before the event.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so the financial concept here is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the windows used to estimate the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moral relationship of alpha and beta. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
between the GME and the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uncontaminated by the event itself, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation start date is we have here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is May 15th, 2020. And then the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation end is December 14th,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The alternative estimation window for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the robustness robustness is shorter. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 90 days as compared to the 120 days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as the previous window. And so the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
financial concept here is that a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
robustness check is very important. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if results change significantly or if,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a slight change then the model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parameters might not be as stable. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the alternative estimation we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the start date of I believe that's June,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31st.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes. Um July 31st, sorry, the 7th, July,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31st. And then our alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation date is the same as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation date which is the December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And so for the event window, we have Jan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021 or search period. And the financial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concept here is that there is a period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over which abnormal returns also shown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a R are calculated to see if the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock behaved abnormally relative to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAPM predicted risk. So for this the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event start is December 15th and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event date oh and that's 2020 and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event date so it's after our estimated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end and our event end is February 15th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021. Now looking at the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acquisition function or the DRI we here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a function where we get the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from the ticker the market proxy the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start and end dates and we're looking at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the historical data historical price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data. So we're looking at the adjusted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
close and the volume and we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculating the log returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here. We go ahead and download data from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yahoo Finance and this auto adjust is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
false to ensure that close is present,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and as the adjusted close price is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard for calculating returns in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event studies. So here we go ahead and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download that data. We also extract the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME and the market adjusted close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices. So we're dropping the rows with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the missing data. And this is just a way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to clean the data, make sure it's all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
organized. Then we're going to go ahead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and calculate the log returns. So this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is where we're doing the compound, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
continuous compounding. The financial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concept behind this is that log returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are preferred, especially in academic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
studies for statistical properties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right here, we're just going ahead and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
renaming the columns clearly for use in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the OS regression just so that we know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what we're doing. It has the proper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
units and things of that sort. And I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think this just makes it clear on what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the data we're looking at is explaining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then we're extracting the GME volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And this is used only for the GME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trigger specifically. And it explicitly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
names the series volume. And so this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avoids a key error later for when,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
joining the data together. We then go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahead and combine the returns and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
volumes into a single data frame. And we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go ahead and print it and return it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next go into the critical data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
verification. So this is define and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discover requirement of the driver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
framework. So we go ahead and verify the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data claims and the first claim that we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have here is that it was 0.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or zero or 4 cents in August 2020. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what we're trying to verify. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we download the data specifically for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the claims time frame. So here you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see that we're looking specifically for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
August 1st versus September 1st.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then here if the August date is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
empty then we go ahead and verify the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME range. And if the conclusion claim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that the GME is traded at 4 cents in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
August it's incorrect then the lowest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusted cost in August 2020 is not 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cents. Next is claim two. So, the surge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to $483 in Jan 2021 is the verification.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're downloading the data for the peak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
search rate, very similar to what we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
previously did. And now we're checking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the $483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, I'm going into the statistical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
validation. So, this is the validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stage. We're going to perform a t test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to look for those abnormal returns and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're trying to validate the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency. And so here we're going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
print out the interpretation that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most consistent with the EMH discussion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um here the financial concept that's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
important is that the null hypothesis is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the mean AR is zero. And if the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
null is true then the EMH holds because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all abnormal performance is just noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not important. Um but alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis is that if the mean AR is not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zero and if the alternative is true then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the EMH is violated which means that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some exploitable abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance which is not good and so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once we perform the one sample t test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing the mean of AR to the value of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zero is and this is what's done here we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go ahead and print out the event window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mean for AR are the t statistic and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p value. And now going into the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
statistics a little bit. If the p value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is less than the alpha value, then we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the conclusion and we have the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different interpretations that the mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of normal return is statistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
significantly different um from the zero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over this event window. And so this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence that the prices did not fall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fully and immediately reflect available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information about the GME during the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short squeeze. So this is inconsistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the semi- strong for semi- strong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form market efficiency and this specific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
period in stock. So and then we have an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if else statement here. And then going,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
into our model estimation function, our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DRRI tab estimation. Just going to check,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the video also real quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have our estimated CAPM. And so here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're looking at the abnormal return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculations using the CAPM framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
requirement. We have our dependent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
independent variables. We have our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
constant term. This is also known as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alpha or the intercept to the regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model. We're running an ordinary le,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
squares OS regression where we have our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equation and then we're going to extract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the estimated parameters. So the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
financial concepts here that are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
important to note is that the alpha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
measures the stock's axis return versus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what CAPM predicts and the beta measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stock systematic risk sensitivity to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the market. So looking at the abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return and the car calculation which is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core ASM we are calculating the abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns and the cumulative abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns. So this is R and CAR or A R and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C A R. So for the expected returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're looking at the same equation that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we had before. And the financial concept,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here is that this calculates the return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME that should have earned based on its,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal risk profile alpha and beta and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the actual market movement on the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So for and this is the expected return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then here is the abnormal return. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the difference between the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actual return and the expected return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So if AR is non zero then it suggests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the market efficiency is an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idiotric event.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now looking at the abnormal cumulative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal return which is the C. The,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
financial concept here is that C is the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sum of all ARS over the event window. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a large sustained deviation from zero as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we expected with the GME is the primary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence against EMH. So here we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically calculated expected return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal return and the cumulative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now we're going to have the execution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
block. So here we're first going to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the critical verification and it's very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
important to fact check before running,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
main analysis just to ensure that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is aligned the proper way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then step one before we even do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything. Sorry that's the step to make,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure everything is correct, all the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that we have is accurate, things of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sort. Next is data acquisition. And so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is getting the baseline estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
window data and capam uses return only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we can go ahead and drop volume get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rid of things that are not needed to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculate etc. And then here for the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alternative estimation window this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where we're going to do the robustness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check. Same thing drop volume. Here we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the event window data everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that we need to get. And then this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has the returns for the AR and C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculations. Next, we have the CAPM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation. So, this is the first stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, we're going to estimate the CAPM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the primary 120D and the alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90-day windows. So, remember this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the time frame that we're taking or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 120 days or the 90 days. And then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for our AR and C calculations, we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to calculate them using the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
baseline CAPM estimates. Then we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to go ahead and calculate them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using the alternative capam estimates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for robustness check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then we have the volume analysis and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pattern identification. So this is a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technical requirement and this step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically helps address the 10-fold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
increase claim and it also identifies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the market micro structure. Here we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
three equations. The first one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculates the baseline daily volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second calculates the event average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daily volume and the third calculates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the multiplier factor. The fifth step is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the statistical validation aspect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we're going to test for significance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the primary AR series. And then we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a robustness check on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation window to see if the car,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
results are sensitive to the estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
period choice. And then we're going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compare the terminal car under baseline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
versus the alternative cap estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're then going to go ahead and run the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
statistical validation for the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alternative estimation as well. And then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our seventh step, which I believe is my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last step, is the actual data validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aspect of it. Sorry, the visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aspect of it. And so this is where we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have all of our visualization. So we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a professional plot, our axes, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then we also again talking about the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
financial concepts because I think I got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that a lot in my feedback. So I just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want to make sure I touch upon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything, but plotting volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alongside the C helps us to identify if,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's any abnormal returns that are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correlated with the intense trading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
activity. So this is evidence of hurting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or speculation and things like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also here I'm using scientific notation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because the high volume numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exist. So it's helping out with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
readability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then I'm going to add the key event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lines for qualitative analysis. Um here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just vertical line for the Ryan Cohen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
news. This is a public information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event. Vertical line just things to make,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it look cleaner. Um specifics like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then helping out with the layout to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ensure there's no overlapping. And then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have a legend in the corner, stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like that. And then my final output. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so here is my output. I can give you a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second to just look at it and then I can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go ahead and give you the overview of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it. Um, let me just double check and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure this is recording. Perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So here is my summary overall about the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
charts that we have. So firstly, this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event study began by verifying the key,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factual claims about the GME's price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavior, right? So the data confirms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the GameStop never traded at 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cents in August 2020, but rather its,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusted closing price ranges from 1.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to um 1.67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and making that original claim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incorrect. So the January 2021 data also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aligns with the widely documented price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surge that accumulated near $483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
split adjusted validating the event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
period used in the analysis and using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the S&P 500 as the market proxy. I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KA happen regressions were run on both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120day and 90-day estimation window and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both windows did produce similar results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but with the beta estimates around 1.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and small positive alphas demonstrating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the model is stable and robust um I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think during this window abnormal return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AR calculations reveal that several days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with unusually large deviations from the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expected returns and the output table,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the first few days shows the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns as high as 22% on a single day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me show you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, right here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the calcul the and the cumulative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal return the C it climbs quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eventually reaching a peak of 3.058 058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on January 27, 2021. The exact date the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GME reached its intraday high during the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short squeeze. The volume statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reinforce this picture. And I'm really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy that we tried to combine stats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with financial basics as well because I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think they definitely go hand in hand in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the workplace. And so the baseline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average volume during the estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
window was roughly 32 million shares.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And while the event window saw volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surge to around 181 million shares per,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
day, a 5.6 increase, this dramatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
escalation in trading activity combined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the car spike aligns with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well-known behavioral dynamics such as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hurting, FOMO, and social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coordinated pressure. Um, going into,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chart, this chart combines the C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the volume, and it visualizes these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
effects very clearly. So this is a good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way to be able to see what's going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So C remains relatively stable in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
early window, but then it is it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
accelerates very sharply on January,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27th. And so the volume bars, they rise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in parallel and it shows that several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
days with hundreds of millions of shares,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are traded. Um the vertical markers such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as the Cohen joining the board and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trading halls on January 27th, they,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
align really closely to the turning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
points in the C curve and it illustrates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how public news and market structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
events coincided with the abnormal price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
behavior. However, oh not sure what's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going on there. I don't know if you guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saw that, but it my screen was sorry my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen was like flashing pink. But,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyways, going back to what I was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saying, I think despite the visually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dramatic patterns, the statistical tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general tell a different story,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right? The t stats on the mean abnormal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns for both estimation windows, a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high yield p values of the 0.61 and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0.69. So, this leads to a failure to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reject the null hypothesis and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average AR equals zero. Um, and then I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think based strictly on this hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
test, the results do not provide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
statistically significant evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
against semi-rong form market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency. And so in summary, the text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
output, the tables, and the charts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
together show a very clear photo. I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think um the GME experienced extreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abnormal price movements and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unprecedented trading volume during a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short squeeze. And this is driven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
largely by the behavioral and the I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think the behavioral and the structural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forces. But when formally tested through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the CAPM normal return statistics, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event study does not statistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
violate the semi-strong EMH. And so this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highlights the tension between the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
empirical data patterns and theoretical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency testing. Thanks for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
listening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",False,1,Uh hi", my name is Arian and this is my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
session 8 assignment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh our video assignment. So first going,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over the problem, we're a risk manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at a hedge fund and um we're given a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scenario that basically sorry we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given a scenario basically after a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recent 8% single day loss our current,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk system did not predict or did not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expect uh we want to see the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comprehensive risk management overhaul.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We want to implement value at risk and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress testing to better monitor and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
control portfolio risk. So we want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
construct the portfolio at least five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
securities analyze the risk implement V,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using both historical parametric methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress test with historical scenarios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and custom shocks and then interpret the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk that we've came up with as well as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recommend how to set better risk limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that we won't go over this 8% single,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
day loss or something similar. So I'll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go over my work using driver as well as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Python code that I developed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
libraries I use etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So first I'll start over with kind of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like an executive summary I call it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is that we want to overhaul the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk management in our hedge fund with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um a portfolio construction data return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis value risk parametric methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
custom stress test risk interpretation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and reflection of model limitations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tailor risk and culture and we want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strengthen the risk framework improve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crisis preparedness and ensure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
governance. So first the problem is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 8% draw wasn't expected or predicted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the existing models which means we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have to upgrade the risk framework so we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you know in hindsight look at this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8% and say like it won't happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So we want to implement value at risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add stress testing using custom and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
historical models improve risk reporting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
versus limits and provide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recommendations based on this. So to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start off uh we're going to construct a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
diversified five security portfolio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using a good basket of stocks which I'll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
identify later. Calculate the daily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns of set stock as well as the risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these stocks bring. Compute the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
historical V of these stocks using 95%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and 99% as well as the parametric and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal V using 95% of 99%. Um then use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008 as well as 2020 COVID times as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crash stress tests and then also run our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
own custom shocks if our equity drops by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10% as well as if we go up by 200 bips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh the interest rate shock and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're going to see the results of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compare the models that we're using and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recommend risk limits as well as reflect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on what we can improve on that. So to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that we're going to be using Python um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're going to be using pandas numpy y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finance and mapp. We're going to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using data from 2018 because um that's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the most accurate range that we've been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
identified from 2018 to 2025. And the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vast securities we're choosing is Apple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AAPL, Microsoft, MSFT, JPM, JP Morgan,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XOM, and then TLT, which is a bond ETF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um which is very popular for like a safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock or something that people would,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
invest in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now to represent these stocks, we want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to accurately weigh them based on their,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sector. Um their um overall business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model and um everything else. So for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apple, it's a technology sector stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 25% weight. Microsoft is a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technology sector stock with 25% weight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPM has financial is a financial stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JP Morgan with a 20% weight in our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
portfolio. XOM is an energy stock with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50% weight. And TLT is bonds with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50% weight in our portfolio. We want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use daily return and portfolio return as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our key formulas in the um in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis. And with the formulas outlined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in this Google doc over here, we can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just simplify to T equals WTRT and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RT PT minus one, PT - 1, etc. Then we're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to use historical V, which is V,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95% is the fifth percentile returns and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B 99% is the first percentile. For,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parametric V, we want to use the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
following formulas where V equals these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
values. We're using Z95 as the first one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is our VA 95% over here and Z99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is our VAR 99% our first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
percentile versus our fifth percentile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of returns and we can get 1.65 and 2.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from that. Now the method the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
methodology that we've outlined for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress testing is simulating losses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under extreme but plausible conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
historical events modeled using our data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which we're time slicing and then custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shots which we're applying factor by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factor. So now to implement this code uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we created a Python script and we ran it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in Jupyter notebook or sorry Google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
collab. Um so what we did was we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imported the data and we computed the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return using Y finance. We pulled the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusted closing prices of all these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stocks. We looked at the daily returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and we multiplied them by the weights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that we identified up here. Um to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the portfolio returns um total we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculated the historical and parametric,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VR. First historical with percentiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and parametric VR using mean and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard deviation. So basic statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third, we use the two stress tests of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008 financial crisis and the March 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pandemic crash. And then we also have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
custom shocks of negative 10% equity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drop and a 15% TLT decline from rates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using 200 pips up. Now the outputs to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
show are a VAR 95% and 90% historical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and parametric as well as a minimum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crisis period returns and then a custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shock loss estimator. not to validate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So first we want to see the code right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So as you can see this is a Google uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
collab where we're importing Y finance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pandas, numpy as our libraries. We're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pulling the data for Apple, MSFT, JPM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XOM and TLT and we're changing the start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
date to include 2008. Um so we actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had 2018 before but what I realized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while completing the project and writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my driver doc up is we're testing with a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008 stress test but we don't even have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the data from 2008. So it it doesn't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sense to use 2018 to 2025 data when,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're stress testing with the scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's out of that range. So either I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to change the stress test or change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the range and I decided that changing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the data range would be much more easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to implement than changing the uh stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
test. Next we implemented our portfolio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weights and returns as well as historic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and parametric V formulas. And then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally, we added the historical stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tests of 2008 and 2020 into the U code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the custom shock test using the 10%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equity drop and a 200 pips rate shock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then we weighted that with our um equity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and bond weights custom stress. And then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we finally plotted the portfolio daily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returns um and this is what we use the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
map plot lib library for because it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes it a lot easier to visualize the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data. Then we just printed the summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of all the calculations that we just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discussed over here in a simple to read,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of um part. So chaining started in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008. As you can see here, we completed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
five out of five. And as you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the portfolio returns using 0% are over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here. Uh if you look at 2008, pretty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stable near the crash, went down to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
negative.10, which is a lot. And exact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same thing to 2020. pretty much the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exact same portfolio rate drop but also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had a pretty similar spike in portfolio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daily returns around the same time frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is interesting to see right before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the recession. And then as you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notice on the other um timelines just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moderate spikes maybe 2025 and a massive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spike because of AI but not as big of a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loss 5% isn't really something that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're going to go cry about. Um but for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our historical bar using 95 to 99.018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
018 and the negative.034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parametric we have negative.02 and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
negative.029 for 99%. Using the worst 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
day was a negative.10 loss 10% loss and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst March 20 was a 10% loss as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well and in our custom shock scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which we set up over here it was a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar 10% loss. So overall we can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the losses in the biggest uh market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recession days are capped at 10% using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the models that we identified and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress test we identified for uh this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weighted portfolio using historic data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now coming back to our validation our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
code execution with our errors our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return distributions do look realistic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it's not overly ambitious so 20%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or 15%. But it does work. Our VA V,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
values do fall between our stress test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outcomes and our stress losses do exceed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the V which you can see over here 10.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is a little bit higher than both of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other days. So overall it's expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as you can see this 10.7 versus 02.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now we want to interpret this means that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our V is less than -2%. While stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
test show about nine uh 10% losses means,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our V underestimates tail events our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correlations increased during crisises,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and even though we were able to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
diversify with some bonds as you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the um over here our ticker TLT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is the bond ETF was in our equity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does help but it still fails in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme shocks when the entire market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just goes out. Now to evolve our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis, we want to add expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shortfall for say tail losses, adjust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fat tail and then also expand our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress library or stress library to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
include more simulations of crashes in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the market which we can fine tune the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
model for. So like the com crash, the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oil crash 2014 and flash crash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simulations and using these we can kind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of fine-tune our losses in our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
portfolios or our weights better. uh we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want to introduce volatility detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um because this would help us uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fine-tune a lot of our models and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also develop a live A dashboard for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real-time data which I think is the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
important out of all we've discussed so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
far including the stress library with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the docom crash oil crash flash crash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simulations and so overall this is how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can evolve our analysis um in terms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of what we already done here to kind of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh over optimize our hedge fund scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because uh currently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could it could do better overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now we want to reflect on the overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assignment in the project we did. And so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first thing is that like all hedge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funds do have sophisticated risk models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So what we want to see is like you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did this one fail? Why did it go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
down 8%. And like there's so many,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
examples, right? We can see the Silicon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Valley bank went belly up because it had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bad risk model. For this one, it could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have been over reliance on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
distributions, ignoring correlation, uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
black swan events occurring more than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumed or even human factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overconfidence in the model because of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance and just kind of overlooking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small gaps, maybe not testing your risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis, your liquidity in your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
portfolio. Reflecting on the V that we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used, uh V helps with the simple of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
communication. We're able to communicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy percents and very simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
formulas and it's very good for routine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monitoring, but it hides tail losses. It,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't really good for extreme markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which sometimes it could be which we've,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen in the recession times and there's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a false sense of safety using V. Now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reflecting on the risk management versus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk measurement. So the measurement is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about models and numbers like if we want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to measure our risk we can say like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9.88% is a risk if the stock goes down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the stock goes up. But in the end the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk management is the key. Um because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the risk management takes the risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
measurements as inputs and uses that to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of define the governance behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which kind of tells us that yes the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedge fund can um overhaul their risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
management as much as they can. They can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add stress testing a better monitor they,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can control their risk better but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall the management is what's key. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the governance behavior culture and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incentives matter more than the formulas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're using. So even though we've,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calculated this entire Python script,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've used the analysis. We've got the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
V numbers, the person who uses that VR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
numbers to conduct analysis and kind of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
establish positions is more important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
than just the uh measurement of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
models and the numbers and why why I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think or reflecting on why risked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shortfall is better is that it captures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the average loss in worst scenarios and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is more resilient for tailor risk. It's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a much more holistic review of um risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a as a measure overall. On top of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this, yeah, I just think risk management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is a key and that that just a lot more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
human than numbers can make it. And in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
terms of board level recommendations, uh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is our final kind of reflection of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the project like what we want to um,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recommend is the risk management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overhaul is that we want to set new risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limits for max daily 99% V as negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.5%. our stress limit as negative 8%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and our position cap as 30% asset. We,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want to strengthen the governance and as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we talked about the governance includes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the risk management instead of the risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
measurement and to do this we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weekly risk committees maybe even hire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone like a risk provider automatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
deleveraging on breach which is very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to implement and then daily V and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress monitoring even if you need to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hire someone which a lot of big banks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and hedge funds do. On top of this, we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want to have technology enhancements to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move to expected shortfall, add more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regime switching analytics, and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
build automated alerts. So you can get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an automated alert as long as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
portfolio is falling and kind of see how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to optimize from there. And finally, one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thing I want to add is like a personal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reflection completing this project is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that uh when coding in Python, um it's a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lot of iterations that are needed to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of have the data work together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because sometimes um just GPT and Gemini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just can't make it work and just using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like stack overflow stuff just helps me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So that's my project. Uh thank you for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
listening and yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",False,1,# Session 8: Market Efficiency &amp; Behavioral Finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## Video Presentation Transcript,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## INTRODUCTION (30 seconds),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hello, I'm presenting my analysis of market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event from 2020-2021. This assignment tests whether markets efficiently process information, or if behavioral biases create exploitable mispricings. I'll be walking through my complete DRIVER framework analysis," showing how I used event study methodology and statistical testing to evaluate the Efficient Market Hypothesis.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE D: DEFINE &amp; DISCOVER (1-2 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me start with Phase D - Define and Discover, where I frame the problem and identify what data I need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**The Goal:** I'm testing market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze. The core question is: do markets efficiently price information, or do behavioral biases create systematic mispricings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Critical First Step:** The assignment claims GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020. This seemed extremely low for a public company, so my first priority is verifying this claim against actual data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Event Timeline:** I'm analyzing several key events - August 2020 when GME was near bankruptcy, September 2020 when Ryan Cohen acquired his stake, January 2021 when the Reddit-driven squeeze peaked at $483, and the February 2021 congressional hearings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Data Requirements:** I need GME daily prices from August 2020 to present, SPY as my market proxy for CAPM calculations, trading volume data, and precise dates for key events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Key Parameters:** I'm using a 10-day window before and after each announcement, a 100-day pre-event estimation period for calculating beta, a 3% risk-free rate, and a 5% significance level for statistical tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Outputs:** I'll calculate abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, classify which EMH form was violated, identify behavioral biases, assess whether rational investors could have profited, and run statistical significance tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Success Criteria:** First and foremost, verify data accuracy - especially that 4-cent claim. Then provide clear EMH classification, establish statistical significance, distinguish between ex-ante prediction versus ex-post hindsight," and give an honest assessment of inefficiency versus unknown risk factors.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE R: REPRESENT (2-3 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now Phase R - Represent, where I map out my analytical approach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Analysis Pipeline:** My workflow goes from historical data through beta estimation, calculating normal returns, finding abnormal returns, and finally testing efficiency. Specifically: GME and SPY prices feed into CAPM regression, which gives me expected returns, then I compare actual versus expected to get abnormal returns, and finally run statistical tests.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Event Study Timeline:** This is crucial. Days -100 to -11 are my estimation period where I calculate beta. Days -10 to -1 establish the pre-event baseline. Day 0 is the announcement itself. Days +1 to +10 test for post-event drift. In an efficient market, all reaction happens on Day 0. In an inefficient market, we see continued drift in the following days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Variable Definitions:** Let me walk through the key variables in my analysis table. R_GME is GME's daily return, R_market is SPY's daily return. Alpha and beta come from my CAPM regression. E(R) is my expected return calculated as alpha plus beta times market return. AR is abnormal return - actual minus expected. CAR is cumulative abnormal return - the sum of ARs over the event window. And t-statistic tests statistical significance using standard error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**The Four Key Formulas:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First, CAPM Expected Return: E(R) = α + β × R_market. This gives me the baseline return without any event effect. I estimate this using the pre-event period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second, Abnormal Return: AR = R_actual - E(R). This measures the surprise from the event. When AR is greater than zero, we have a positive surprise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third, Cumulative Abnormal Return: CAR equals the sum of daily ARs from Day -10 to Day +10. This captures the total effect of the event. The efficiency test is: CAR should equal zero after Day 0 if markets are efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fourth, Statistical Significance: t equals CAR divided by standard error, where standard error is the standard deviation of AR divided by square root of n. I'll test if CAR is significantly different from zero. The decision rule: reject efficiency if absolute value of t is greater than 1.96 at the 5% level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Implementation Plan:** Seven clear steps. First, download GME and SPY data and verify that August 2020 price claim. Second, calculate daily returns and check for outliers. Third, estimate beta using regression on the pre-event period. Fourth, run the event study and calculate abnormal returns. Fifth, test multiple event windows - Ryan Cohen's announcement, the January peak, and trading restrictions. Sixth, classify which EMH form was violated. Seventh, identify behavioral bias patterns like herding, overconfidence," and anchoring.""""",,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE I: IMPLEMENT (5-7 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now let's move to Phase I - Implementation. I'll run through each code cell and show you the results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
### CELL 1: Setup and Data Download,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Starting with data acquisition. I'm importing pandas, numpy, and pandas_datareader. My date range is January 2020 through December 2024 to capture the full event cycle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great, data downloaded successfully. I can see GME and SPY both downloaded, and I have the full date range with over 1,200 trading days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Now the critical verification:** The assignment claims GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020. Let me check the actual data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Show August 2020 results],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And here's the issue - the actual August 2020 GME price was [read actual price from output]," NOT $0.04 as stated in the assignment. This is a significant factual discrepancy that I need to document. The claim appears to be incorrect - possibly confusing split-adjusted prices or another error. I'll need to note this in my final report to the instructor.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
### CELL 2: Returns and Beta Estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next, calculating returns and estimating beta using CAPM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at daily return statistics: GME shows extremely high volatility compared to SPY - this makes sense given the dramatic price swings. GME's standard deviation is much larger than the market's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now the CAPM regression results. I'm using January through July 2020 as my estimation period - before the major events began. My beta estimate is [read beta value]. This tells us GME is [interpret: if &gt;1.5 say """"very volatile"""""," if &gt;1 say """"more volatile than market"""""," if &lt;1 say """"less volatile""""]. The R-squared is [read R-squared]", showing how much of GME's returns are explained by market movements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This beta gives me my baseline for calculating expected returns - what GME """"should"""" return given market movements"," if no special events were occurring.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
### CELL 3: Event Study Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now the heart of the analysis - event study for abnormal returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm testing two major events: Ryan Cohen's stake announcement in September 2020 and the January 2021 peak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Event 1: Ryan Cohen Stake:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Read results for Ryan Cohen event],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The abnormal return on the event day was [X]%, and the post-event average was [Y]%. The cumulative abnormal return from Day 0 to Day +10 was [Z]%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at statistical significance: the t-statistic is [value], which is [above/below] the critical value of 1.96. This means the abnormal returns are [significant/not significant] at the 5% level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For market efficiency: [X]% of the reaction happened on Day 0, suggesting the market was [efficient/moderately efficient/inefficient]. We can see [substantial/some/little] post-event drift, which [violates/supports] the semi-strong form of the EMH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Event 2: January 2021 Peak:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Read results for January peak],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This event shows even more dramatic patterns. The abnormal returns here are [describe pattern]. The statistical tests show [interpretation]. This is clear evidence of [efficiency/inefficiency].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall, we're seeing significant post-event drift in both cases," suggesting markets did NOT immediately incorporate all public information - a violation of semi-strong efficiency.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
### CELL 4: Behavioral Finance Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me analyze the behavioral biases driving these patterns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at the January 2021 squeeze period: total return was [X]%, with a maximum daily gain of [Y]% and maximum daily loss of [Z]%. Daily volatility was an extreme [W]% - far beyond normal market behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Five behavioral biases identified:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**1. Herding Behavior:** The Reddit coordination created massive collective buying. Social media amplified the herd mentality - everyone wanted in on the squeeze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**2. Overconfidence:** Retail investors believed they could predict squeeze timing and continued buying at extreme valuations, underestimating the risks of sudden reversal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**3. Anchoring Bias:** The initial low price of around [$X] anchored valuations. Even $100+ seemed """"cheap"""" relative to the $483 peak. Past prices heavily influenced perceptions of fair value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**4. Loss Aversion for Short Sellers:** Short sellers held losing positions too long. Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss before finally closing positions - the pain of realizing losses led to poor decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**5. Momentum Effect:** [X] out of [Y] days were positive during the squeeze period. Winners kept winning... until they didn't. This is a classic momentum anomaly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The overall assessment: multiple behavioral biases created extreme mispricing. Social media coordination amplified irrational behavior," and traditional fundamental analysis completely failed during this period. Markets were HIGHLY INEFFICIENT.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
### CELL 5: Summary and EMH Classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally, my overall market efficiency classification.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**EMH Forms Assessment:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Weak-Form Efficiency** - testing if past prices predict future returns: VIOLATED. Evidence shows momentum patterns were highly predictable. Rising prices led to more buying through positive feedback loops. Technical analysis would have worked during the squeeze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Semi-Strong Form Efficiency** - testing if public information is immediately reflected: VIOLATED. We saw post-event drift after major announcements. The Ryan Cohen announcement had delayed price reaction. Markets took days or weeks to fully process information, meaning fundamental analysis opportunities existed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Strong-Form Efficiency** - testing if insider information can generate profits: UNKNOWN due to insufficient data. We'd need insider trading data to test this properly, though the congressional hearings suggest there may have been issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Profitability Analysis:** Could rational investors have profited? Ex-post with hindsight - YES, obviously. But ex-ante with prediction - DIFFICULT but possible. The short squeeze mechanics were publicly known, but timing and magnitude were unpredictable. Risk-adjusted returns would have been extremely high risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Overall Conclusion:** Markets were HIGHLY INEFFICIENT during this period. Primary cause: behavioral biases plus social media coordination. EMH violations: both weak and semi-strong forms violated. The key lesson: markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And critically: the data correction - the assignment claim about 4 cents is factually incorrect. I recommend notifying the instructor of this discrepancy.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE V: VALIDATE (3-4 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase V - Validate. I need to ensure my analysis is statistically sound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Running through 10 validation tests:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 1 - Data Completeness:** Zero missing values in both GME and SPY. Data complete - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 2 - Return Calculation Validity:** I manually calculated the first return and compared it to my function. They match to 6 decimal places - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 3 - Beta Estimation:** Beta is [value], which is in a reasonable range. R-squared is between 0 and 1 as required. Beta is positive as expected for a stock - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 4 - Abnormal Return Logic:** Testing day 100: AR calculated matches AR manual calculation - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 5 - CAPM Expected Return:** Expected return calculated matches manual calculation using alpha plus beta times market return - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 6 - Statistical Tests:** I'm using the correct critical t-value of plus or minus 1.96 for a 5% two-tailed test - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 7 - Financial Reasonableness:** GME is more volatile than SPY as expected. GME volatility is [X]% versus SPY's [Y]% - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 8 - Event Study Methodology:** Estimation period has over 50 days as required for reliable beta estimation. Event window of ±10 days is standard - check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 9 - August 2020 Price Verification:** This confirms the critical finding. Assignment claimed 4 cents, actual data shows approximately [$X]. Data discrepancy documented - this is a factual error in the assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Test 10 - Abnormal Return Distribution:** Mean AR is close to zero, which is good - it means my baseline model isn't systematically biased. Standard deviation and skewness are reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All validation checks passed. Key findings: data quality is excellent, calculations verified, CAPM model properly implemented," event study methodology is valid. Critical issue: August 2020 price claim is incorrect. Analysis is statistically sound and ready for interpretation.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE E: EVOLVE (3-4 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase E - Evolve, where I connect this to the broader course framework.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Run cell],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Universal Pattern Across Sessions:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sessions 3 through 7 all ASSUMED efficient markets. Stock prices equal fair fundamental value in the DDM. Bond prices reflect correct risk assessment. Portfolio returns provide appropriate risk compensation. CAPM beta is sufficient to predict returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Session 8 TESTS that efficiency assumption. The GME case shows markets can be HIGHLY INEFFICIENT. Behavioral biases matter as much as fundamentals. Social media can override rational pricing. Traditional models break down in extreme cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The key insight: information should flow to prices efficiently, but HOW efficiently varies dramatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Connection to CAPM from Session 7:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAPM assumes semi-strong market efficiency. If markets are efficient, only beta matters - idiosyncratic risk is diversified away, and all stocks lie on the Security Market Line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But GME violates these assumptions completely. We saw massive abnormal returns NOT explained by beta. Idiosyncratic factors - specifically the short squeeze - dominated pricing. Price movements were driven by behavioral biases, not fundamentals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When does CAPM work? Normal market conditions, large liquid stocks, long-term horizons, professional institutional investors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When does CAPM fail? Market stress like panics and manias, small illiquid stocks, short-term trading, retail investor dominance as we saw with GME.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Bridge to Corporate Finance:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Market efficiency directly impacts Sessions 9 through 12. In capital structure decisions: if markets are efficient, capital structure is irrelevant under Modigliani-Miller. If inefficient, firms should time equity issuance when overvalued.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In capital budgeting: if efficient, use market-based WACC. If inefficient, adjust for market sentiment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In M&amp;A: if efficient, mergers create value only through synergies. If inefficient, you can buy undervalued targets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The corporate implication: CFOs must decide whether to trust market prices or use independent judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Professional Applications:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In investment management: event-driven hedge funds exploit post-announcement drift, quant trading identifies behavioral patterns, value investing finds mispriced securities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In corporate finance: IPO timing capitalizes on overvaluation, share buybacks occur when undervalued, M&amp;A targets underpriced firms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In financial analysis: equity research identifies inefficiencies, credit analysis finds bond mispricings, ESG analysis catches sustainability risks markets are slow to price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**The Practical Reality:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the time, markets are efficient - think large-cap U.S. stocks, Treasury bonds, major currency pairs. Strategy: use passive indexing, focus on costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes markets are less efficient - small-cap stocks, emerging markets, corporate bonds, real estate. Strategy: active management can add value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rarely, markets are highly inefficient - market panics like March 2020, bubbles like tech 2000 and housing 2007, meme stocks in 2021. Strategy: contrarian positioning, but HIGH RISK.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Career advice: Reality is that markets are """"mostly efficient"""" - so a hybrid approach makes most sense. Core passive holdings plus selective active strategies in less efficient market segments.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## PHASE R: REFLECT (2 minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally, Phase R - Reflect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Core Skills Mastered:** I now understand event study methodology using CAPM-based abnormal returns. I can statistically test market efficiency across weak, semi-strong, and strong forms. I can identify behavioral biases in real market data. And critically, I can distinguish between ex-ante prediction and ex-post hindsight analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**The Big Insight:** Markets are """"mostly efficient"""" but can experience extreme inefficiencies during behavioral manias. GameStop showed that social media coordination and behavioral biases can completely override fundamental analysis", violating both weak and semi-strong EMH. The key lesson: knowing which market regime you're in matters more than the analytical tools you use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Key Takeaways:**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First, data verification is absolutely critical. The assignment's claim about 4 cents was factually incorrect - actual prices were significantly higher. Always verify your data sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second, EMH is a spectrum, not binary. Markets are efficient most of the time, wildly inefficient occasionally during bubbles and crashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third, behavioral biases create real opportunities - but timing them is nearly impossible without extreme risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fourth, CAPM fails during extremes. Beta couldn't explain GME's abnormal returns - idiosyncratic factors completely dominated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**What This Means for Career and Investing:** If markets were perfectly efficient, passive indexing would always win. If markets were always inefficient," active trading would always win. But reality is that markets are """"mostly efficient"""" - so a hybrid approach makes the most sense. Core passive holdings for the efficient segments", plus selective active strategies in less efficient market segments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
## CONCLUSION (30 seconds),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In conclusion, my analysis using the DRIVER framework shows that the GameStop short squeeze represents a clear violation of market efficiency. Both weak-form and semi-strong form efficiency were violated, with behavioral biases creating extreme mispricings that persisted for weeks. While markets are generally efficient, this case demonstrates that social media coordination and retail investor behavior can create temporary but significant inefficiencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The practical lesson: respect market efficiency most of the time, but recognize that extreme behavioral episodes do occur - and they're almost impossible to time safely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",False,1,0:00 Hello", today we'll be discussing video assignment number eight. So we'll be starting with the driver framework.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:12 Before we start, we must verify if the data provided that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 is accurate or not, uhm, and I found that it was incorrect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:24 I found this within Yahoo Finance. The lowest it got in August of 2020 was $1.04, and the highest was $1.67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:32 Since the original given statement was incorrect, I will be using the correct data I found for August of 2020 at $1.67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0:44 So for Define and Discover, I will investigate the GME short squeeze as a market efficiency case study. I will specifically be testing if the event violated the Efficient Market Hypothesis, EMH, and if systematic profit was possible for rational investors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:02 I will need to find the GME stock price. I will need to find the GME stock will be calculated using the market model derived from OLS regression during the estimation period, which is given by this equation here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:29 And our variables are, uhm, given as actual daily return of GME on day t. Actual daily return of S&P 500 on day t, and the parameters estimated via OLS on the estimation period data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:46 Then we have our abnormal return calculation. The abnormal return is the difference between the actual return and the expected return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:57 The C.A.R. will be calculated across the event window. And that's given by this Our behavioral analysis plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:14 So, for our implement stage, we will use our Python steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:31 So we'll have our data fetch, So we engineering, our cap and regression, and then the volume analysis, and that is given over here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:47 So we have some graphs, we have our GME stock price and volume, and then the GME closed price and the GME trading volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2:57 And then we just have a bunch of code given here for each of the steps. We have our OLS regression results here, and then some window returns of abnormal, and some other graphs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:17 So, to explain this, our capital regression findings, our GMEs estimated beta was approximately 1.1045. This indicates that it's slightly more volatile than the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:28 It's estimated alpha was 1 was 0.0037, but it was not statistically significant. The p-value is equal to 0.382, suggesting no significant excess returns during the 2020 estimation period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:43 Only about 11.5% of the GME's daily log return variance was explained by the S&P 500. And then our ARCAR analysis findings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3:55 During the event window, GME experienced a substantial positive cumulative abnormal return of approximately 0.529 by the end of February 2021, indicating significant outperformance beyond what market movements and its historical beta would predict.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:13 Our volume analysis findings, the generated plot visually confirmed extreme fluctuations in GME stock price and a dramatic increase in trading volume, particularly during early 2021, consistent with the meme stock event.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:29 Then here we have our graph or for our cumulative abnormal return. Um, and this just shows our market and efficiency with, um, the abnormal return rising drastically, um, as you can see here, making the market inefficient.,,,,,,,,,,,
4:45 Um, the cap and model explained only 11.5% of GME. GME's daily log return variance, suggesting that other factors beyond general market movements were significant drivers of its returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:57 For VOLV, further analysis could involve formally testing the statistical significance of the car using appropriate event study methodologies, such as the t-tests, and performing a more granular analysis of the volume data to quantify the 10-fold retail volume increase and correlate it with specific ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5:21 prices. For our reflect, rational investors could not have systematically profited due to the asset substitution problem, the risk of forced liquidation due to margin sales, and the noise trader risk inherent in coordinating against a crop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",FALSE,1,"McCarthy and this is my session 8
assignment about market efficiency
investigation. So to start off with
define and discover the objective is to
assess market efficiency using the
GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021
as a case study. We begin by verifying
all factual claims in the prompt most
critically the assertion that GME traded
at or cents in August 2020 against
actual disordal data. If incorrect, we
document the accurate figures and
compare clear evidence-based correction.
Non-verification. The analysis will
examine price and volume behavior
between price volume behavior relative
to EMH predictions.
Identify which form of efficiency weak
or strong may have been highlighted and
evaluate whether observed analies
reflect true inefficiency or can be
explained by behavioral biases and
market frictions. So key data
requirements include daily adjusted
closed prices and trading volume from
GME and the S&P 500 from August 2020 to
November 2025, short interest history,
and a timeline of major events
listed below.
Sources include Yahoo Finance, SEC
fillings, and financial news archives.
Preliminary checks confirm that the 0
point the four the 4% price in is
inaccurate
and short interest peak above
14% 140% and volume recurs for 20 times
and monthly capital reported a 53% loss.
This stage establishes a solid
foundation. Verify first facts and apply
event methods including abnormal return
calculations, volume analysis and risk
adjusted performance to test EMH. Assess
rational profitability and integrate
behavioral finance insights such as
shortity and limits to
okay moving on from define and discover
we talk about represent. So the
analytical approach follows a structured
event study to test market efficiency
about around the GME short squeeze. So
we will bare fail product claims
calculate abnormal returns. Measure
abnormal value to detect hurting and
microtor effects and evaluate risk
adjusted returns using the sharp ratio
to determine rational profitability. And
number five, compare the EMH verse
behavioral finance and draw policy
strategy implications. So what are we
solving for? Number one is did public
information get priced instantly? Number
two, were returns predictable or
exploitable? Number three, did prices
eventually stabilize near fundamental
value? So some key formulas and
components. We're just going to try to
speed through this.
We have the market model. So we're using
returning with we have the formula here
and what everything goes into it and
estimated over window of August to
December 2020. Number two we have the
abnormal return with this formula here
and for the abnormal volume this
measures the retail frenzy versus normal
trading. And then for the sharp ratio,
this tested gains more scaler look.
And so for some practical meaning, a
significant C over than zero means a
semi- strong EMH violation. Um like a
high AV and A with social media timing
is a hurting bias. And then high sharp
unpredictable timing is a non systematic
profit. and then posting pit price near
2025 shows efficiency is restored.
Okay, moving on to implementation.
We're now executing the full event study
using real market data pulled directly
from Yahoo Finance.
And this code will be able to
show seven things. Number one is load
GME and S&P 500 data. Verify the 4 cent
claim.
Run the market model to calculate
abnormal return returns AR and
cumulative returns C. Number five,
measureable volume. Six, compute risk
adjust returns using sharp. Seven, show
post evidence
post event price stabilization. So we
know the finance drives the logic and
the code is just engine and let's run
it. So here's the code given by
um AI and to see the results
down here
um you can see right away that
You can see right away what the numbers
actually mean is that the assignment
says GameStop traded at 4 cents in
August 2020, but our data pulled from Y
Finance shows the lowest price was
actually $342 on August 13th, 2020.
And also there's some strong EM was
violated and this is because public
information such as Reddit posts for
140% short interest ride co was not
reflected in price. Also, pre-event
average volume at 5 million shares and
then during the squeeze there is 112
million shares per day. So this
increased to 22.4%
said that a 10fold increase. So reality
was more than doubled than that and this
is just textbook hurting behavior
retailer retail traders moving in lock
step driven by social media sentiment
and no fundamentals.
Lastly, the sharp ratio during the event
window is 2.78,
which is excellent risk adjusted
performance. But the catch here is that
no one could predict the exact timing
and the strategy was not repeatable and
it was pure hindsight. Rational
investors cannot have profited
systematically
and this supports the image in the long
run.
So
just to you know final big takeaway
the GameStop short squeeze was a
temporary market failure. semi- strong
EMA broke down for a few weeks hurting
social media
and limits arbitrage drove a 30 398
abnormal return but no rationale
systematic profit was possible and
within months price stabilizer
fundamentals so the bottom line is EMH
is not dead it's just human in the short
run so for investors this means to stick
to strategies And for regulars, this
means fix broker aification and payment
for order flow, not short selling and
markets are efficient enough just not
during wars.
Moving on to validate. So the objective
here is to confirm that the
implementation implementation is
correct, robust interpretable. So check
the code execution. We ran that through
Google Collab and it was real and
verified. Data integrity was is here
shown below. It shows where we got it.
The event study
also was given all these
numbers and you can just see how it
aligns and matches up.
For robustness, we use actual daily
prices
and we log returns adjusted prices and
we statistical test confirms that ar
is not zero. So logical explanation here
all outputs match the event of events.
So a massive C
is in full lag volume search is hurting
and price return is efficiency restored.
So time to evolve and where we will
optimize, reflect and extract actual
insights. So does it all make sense?
Yes. C being 398%
the two 22.4 times volume and sharp is
12.78 matches real GME squeeze 3.42 is
low.4 is currently actually correct.
Semi strong EMH violated shortterm
restored long-term consistency with
theory. So better ways to improve. Some
options are to useful Yahoo Finance data
set instead of hardcoded or expand the
event window maybe five for robustness.
So these are all the metrics and their
meaning here
but we got to kind of move on
and then this is just some more
structural reflection and logical
conclusions
on where these numbers can be coming
from. So markets are efficient in the
long run but fragile in the short run
psychology meets leverage. So some
strategies to avoid chasing squeezes by
fundamentals post crashes and regulate
broker incentives not shorting. So to
reflect we started with a simple typo
0.04 instead of 3.42 and end up
unpacking one of the wildest events ever
using the driver framework. I went from
facting factchecking claim to providing
semi- strong EMH that got crushed for a
few weeks in January 22. The data showed
plus positive 298%
of Google returns and 22 times volume
spikes and Reddit driving the train. All
systematically bulletproof. But by 2025,
prices back at $24 where fundamentals
said it should be. Markets aren't
perfect, but they're self-correcting.
This process taught me that finance
isn't about genius predictions. It's
about method. Define the problem, map
the truth, run clean code, how they
number, and evolve influence and send
amendment data. I've hit lots of back
roads. The driver can't be grounded.
Fix, test, improve, repeat. That's how
you turn chaos into clarity. So, here's
a key takeaway. EMH holds in the long
run. But social media and retail
firepower can break it short term. Don't
chase squeezes. Don't fight the market.
Build systems. Trust data. Let the
process do the work. That's what this
assignment gave me. Not just a grade,
but a playbook for thinking like a real
analyst.
Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry that was also
very long and I didn't go through
everything cuz I ran out of time to
submit this assignment and for AI help
me with the coding even though you know
the coding was a little
all over the place. I had a hard time
coding with this project. I would use a
bunch of different AI sources and they
would all give me different different
numbers and different codes to use and
different solutions. So I decided just
to stick with one and try to work around
it. So thank you for that AI and thank
you for listening.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Good evening. I'm Ryan McNamera and today we're going to be looking at the GameStop uh event in 2021. So, here I have my uh Python code which is going to help us go through that analysis of what exactly happened um and as well as the stock leading up to that time and um moving past it. and then we're going to go into what um a little bit deeper of an analysis. Um so just to start off, if you're not familiar with the event that I'm talking about, this is in in January of 2021. a bunch of people online uh specifically in a Reddit community decided that they were all going to buy GameStop stock, GameStop stock, and just inflate the price like crazy because the company was going bankrupt. They thought it would be funny to inflate the price. Um, and so they did that and um, it shot up like crazy, but of course they didn't actually um, keep the stock price high and it tanked again afterwards. But um, this specific case was very interesting because it was huge and sparked a lot of conversation everywhere. So let's get into it. So this is my Python code here. I start from the top. Um, we're importing data from Yahoo Finance, um, which is going to help us, which is going to feed our analysis so we know exactly that we're getting the right numbers for everything. So, um, we're just going to I'll scroll through it a little slowly just so we can kind of see everything here. Um, but really what this is going to do, it's going to output a timeline for a bunch of different statistics that's really going to help us um look at this this stock. So, we'll start here um add in on this table here. This is our closing uh price of the stock on the given day. um as well as the uh total shares that were traded and percent return based off the pro uh versus the previous day. So as we can see leading up to it 2019 2020 um stock is trading very very low dollar up to $4 in 2021 in January just before and then January 27th is when the event was and we can see that skyrocket. You can see $86 is where that is where that stock closed on that day. Um, and there were 373 million shares traded, which obviously was an insane return um, of that stock. And then, as we can see, the stock just plummeted after that. Only four days later, uh, we've got the stock down 30%. So, it was not a uh solid event here. Um, yeah. So, we're going to go a little bit more into what this actually means. So, I'm just pulling up something over here. Um, I want to talk about the just the uh the EMH, which um is what we can use to tell if a stock is weak, uh, strong or somewhere in the middle. And here the stock is weak. Um, we can see that if we come Oh, it's frozen. If we come down here a little bit, looking at our our other data here, we can see a lot of numbers that are very close to zero. And so what zero means is that the stock is weak. And we don't want a number um close to zero. That would be very very bad. Um so what this means is this uh this stock is not doing well and we should not invest in it. So the big a big question is is would a reasonable investor get into this? And the answer is no. Um this was a a singularity. It was a one-time event, right? So the biggest thing with that is you don't want you're go if you enter into this you would lose money. Um, a lot of people did lose a lot of money because they put a bunch of money into it and then the stock tanked before they could get out. So, it's not really um that's not really good. Not good at all. Um, if we're looking if we're looking at the um kind of the uh the behavior of the people who were investing, this is kind of where the uh the hurting behavior comes in. This is where it's a big group of people. It's a subreddit with hundreds or thousands of people um all just that came together to do this. They all decided that on one specific day that they were going to buy an insane amount of GameStop. GameStop. Oh boy. Um and that ultimately resulted in this event. Yeah. Um, and what that actually ended up doing is it sparked a lot of talk in like uh the government and political uh parties thinking is this stock manipulation? So, I think it could go either way. Yes, they did manipulate the stock and they did collude about it. Um, but it's kind of hard to go after that many people for that type of thing, especially on when it's all online. Um, but there was uh a lot of risk and very little return for everybody. So, ultimately, I think it was a uh it's definitely a one-time event and people lost a lot of money on it. So, um, yeah, and that's kind of what our our code backs up here. So, yeah. All right. Well, thank you very much. Have a great day. I was tired.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Ethan Menona and this
is the session 8 assignment for the uh
management class where we're going to be
doing a driver analysis on GME market
efficiency. So the main objective of
this um of the stage is to of the define
and discover stage is to define the
problem as well as figure out what are
the main tools and ways that we can use
in order to essentially make it easier
to solve the solve the the question. So
the main problem that we're trying to do
is to investigate the 2020 to 2021
GameStop short squeeze um in market
efficiency. And so we're going to be
using a two two types of analysis which
is an EM framework which is to test the
event against the three forms of the
efficient market hypothesis which is
weak, semi- strong and strong as well as
the behavioral framework which is to
evaluate the event using financial
concepts such as hurting and limits of
arbitrage.
Next is to figure out the main facts
regarding our uh regarding our
assignment which is through the use of
Google and AI. So the main method I use
was Yahoo Finance and so utilizing
uh Yahoo Finance uh I found the the
opening month for August 3rd 2020 which
was $1.04 and so on.
Also, I figured out what the uh the
price surge was as well as the interest
rate what the interest rate was at the
time uh according to some articles
online as well as Yahoo Finance as well
as the main claim which was anal analyst
fundamental value estimates $10 to $40
per share.
Third, I focus on the scope and the key
question that we need to ask ourselves
in order to solve the the main problem,
the problem statement. And so obviously
we are going to be using the two styles
of research which is EMH violation um as
well as the behavioral explanation, what
behavior biases there are and what forms
of EMH were violated.
Also, I wanted to figure out whether a
rational investor could have
systematically profited off of the short
squeeze of GameStop.
Additionally, these are the data sources
that I used. So, um the main data
required as well as the main sources
which was mainly Yahoo as well as some
of the tools that I'll be using which is
Y finance which helps me download
historical market data uh straight from
the library.
Next is the represent stage.
And so the first part about the
represent stage is creating a framework
that we can continue with the implement
stage on.
And so firstly I wanted to do a mix of a
qual quantitative and qualitative study
because it's it's it's very easy to just
input the numbers and create uh a chart
and a set of values. However, the
qualitative data is why these these
numbers matter is the main uh problem
that we're trying to solve. And so the
main plan is to use import Y finance as
well as the regular uh pandas and pipel
500 and GME from finance and then later
on clean that data and essentially make
it easier for the viewer to understand
what happened during that short squeeze.
And thus the next step will be to
essentially study uh the window
definition based on the the DND stage
and we will define the two time frames
which was the estimation window as well
as the event window which is normal
normal period versus the price search
period.
Additionally, we will calculate the
expected returns in order to figure out
whether people could a rational investor
could have successfully um made profits
on this short squeeze as well as the
abnormal returns. And this shows a total
compounding effect of the anomaly over
the event window as well as the final
visual visualization
where we can uh create a chart of the
split adjusted price and trading volumes
as well as the uh cumulative abnormal
returns
uh based on the data.
And so this
is the code that I created.
So obviously the first part of it is to
import the libraries for downloading the
stock data and
creating the charts and thus first
defining the tickers and the dates
uh as well as downloading the data and
selecting the the main columns that we
need which is the the volume and the
closing prices. of the opening prices.
Next, uh I calculated the daily log
returns in order to figure out the
extent to which the short squeeze hit
the market.
Next, defining the time windows uh and
splitting our data based on the
different start estimations and the
actual event start time and then running
the OS regression model in order to
create a alpha and beta values for the
model results and this helps us to
calculate our abnormal returns and C
values. Um
after calculating those we are able to
visualize them by generating plots for
uh the GME price and volume during the
squeeze as well as um the C values and
hence this is what we get get a
calculated alpha of 0.122 calculate bit
of 1.7346
and these are the abnormal calculation
returns
and as as we can see during that time
there was a sudden spike
in Jimmy price as well as the peak price
around the same time.
And as we can see in the CR values,
there's also a sharp spike on abnormal
returns which could showcase uh
uh market manipulation which is the main
point of this uh problem.
And so
when looking at back at the validation
to validate the results from the
implement stage is really important to
relook by myself at the charts and the
values in order to figure out whether uh
then this is like a normal event or if
it's a unique event. And since as we can
clearly see from the graph that it goes
from the that the close price was went
from five from from a really low price
and very low volume into extremely
inflated numbers
of volume and price as well as the as
well as abnormal returns occurring
during this peak. It is clear that this
is not a market a normal market event.
Right. However, some ways that we can
improve this uh and evolve this uh this
method of uh finding the finding market
whether market is for is to use active
investors because this event is a
critical lesson in risk management. uh
and is important to understand how
people can change up their ma their
their ways of uh
their matter of investing as well as uh
regulations and brokers as due to the
lack of regulation in GameStop stock. It
was extremely easy for people to market
manipulate and essentially create a
short squeeze out of nowhere and create
fake demand and fake uh fake demand for
products that do not really have any
demand.
And so reflecting uh from the analysis
which form of EMH was violated. Uh the
weak form was violated as our price/v
volume chart shows that the past trading
data did have predicted power which is
exactly what the weak form EM says is
impossible
as well as the semi strong form was
violated.
And in regards to the EMA versus
behavioral, the efficient market
hypothesis is not wrong, but it is
incomplete as it serves as a good
benchmark for normal market conditions,
the GM event is a perfect case study
where behavioral findings explains the
cause of anomaly and market mechanics
explains its magnitude.
And thus in conclusion, the GME event
does not prove that one can
systematically beat the market. It
proves that markets can profoundly have
irrational when behavioral biases are
amplified by specific market structure
leading to temporary but spectacularly
failure of efficiency.

Good evening. So today we're just going
0:04
to be looking at a stock. We're going to
0:06
be examining a moment where the bedrock
0:08
of the financial theory, the efficient
0:10
market hypothesis, was tested like it
0:13
has not been tested before. And that is
0:17
going to be through GameStop, which had
0:20
a short squeeze in 2021 and it was the
0:23
perfect case study. So using the driver
0:25
framework, we're going to systematically
0:27
break down what happened and most
0:28
importantly what it means for the future
0:31
of finance. So step one was just a
0:34
critical fact check of if the price was
0:37
actually at 4 cents and it was proven
0:40
incorrect that in August of 2020 it was
0:42
between $4 and 650 likely at around 550.
0:47
So our process is going to be to define,
0:50
represent, implement, validate, evolve,
0:52
reflect. We're going to be going through
0:54
the driver framework. So the first step
0:57
is to define and discover and it's about
0:59
framing the problem and verifying and
1:01
stating facts. So the core problem is
1:03
did GameStop's price movement violate
1:06
market efficiency. So crucially we
1:08
started by verifying the core claim is
1:10
that they traded at 4 cents in August of
1:13
2020 and that was proven that it was
1:17
false. They did not.
1:20
This inaccuracy highlights the
1:22
importance of using verifiable data. So
1:24
our communication approach is to
1:26
document the corrected figure and
1:28
proceed with the accurate data. So the
1:31
key timeline would be in August of 2020,
1:34
GameStop was struggling near bankruptcy.
1:37
In September of 2020, um the Chewy
1:40
founder acquired the 13% stake of
1:43
fundamental news event. And then in
1:45
January of 2021, the event window
1:49
massive Reddit driven price surge. So
1:52
then we are on to represent.
1:55
The represent stage is setting the
1:57
analytical plan. So to test this, we
2:00
must use the event study method based on
2:03
the capital asset pricing model. So this
2:05
allows us to separate normal expected
2:08
returns from abnormal unexpected
2:10
returns. Um, think of it as like
2:13
checking your car's fuel economy. We're
2:16
going to use the estimation window to
2:18
calculate the normal mileage. So, this
2:21
gives the alpha and the beta. And we
2:23
look at the window from January of 2021
2:25
to February of 2021 to see how far off
2:30
the normal mileage is from when you
2:32
drove up a steep mountain. So, that
2:35
difference is the abnormal return. The
2:38
estimation window is yeah August 2020 to
2:42
January 1st of 2021 to establish the
2:45
normal behavior and the market proxies
2:48
the S&P 500. The goal would just be to
2:51
calculate the cumulative abnormal return
2:54
across the impact. And then slide three
2:57
is going to be our implement. And so
3:00
this is where we were able to actually
3:02
put um we were able to put all of this
3:06
into Google Collab using Google Gemini
3:10
to generate code for us. So the
3:12
implement stage is where we run this
3:14
regression into the pre-event data and
3:17
it gave us the two critical parameters.
3:21
And so these are just the parameters
3:22
down below. And the low beta suggests
3:25
that before the squeeze it was a lowrisk
3:27
stock.
3:29
um it returns moved less than the
3:31
general market and it was a boring
3:33
stock. Essentially, it was uncorrelated
3:35
to the S&P 500. But
3:40
the pre-event alpha was a negative alpha
3:43
that includes that GameStop had a small
3:46
and sign statistically significant
3:49
negative drift in the stock price daily.
3:52
Even after accounting for the market
3:54
movement, it was slowly losing value. So
3:57
this models the benchmark for rational
3:59
pricing. Anything above is just an
4:03
abnormal return. So then going on to the
4:06
validate stage. This is the scale. So
4:10
the validation stage compares the
4:12
prediction to the reality and the
4:14
results are very staggering. So
4:17
the abnormal returns exploded. The peak
4:21
was plus 2,000%.
4:24
And
4:27
yeah, this means that validation also
4:29
included a volume analysis. Trading
4:31
volume peaked 10 times its average and
4:33
its short interest hit unprecedented
4:36
140% of the float. So these physical
4:39
trading disruptions confirmed the
4:41
theoretical breach of rational pricing.
4:45
And then now we are on to the coding
4:48
results. And so these just show the
4:51
coding results and proving this to be
4:53
true through the validation. It shows
4:55
the pre-event beta, the cumulative
4:57
abnormal return directly through coding
5:00
in collab.
5:03
It is in the evolve stage that we
5:05
translate our findings into the
5:07
actionable strategies. So this is where
5:09
we're actually like using our data. Um
5:12
the shift from passive to active is so
5:15
GameStop's event argues a purely passive
5:18
investment strategy like buying an index
5:20
fund how it failed to capitalize on or
5:22
even hedge against such extremes
5:24
outliers. So it shows that ma massive
5:27
process were
5:29
just able to take active risks and
5:32
information asymmetry is that the
5:34
profits were largely generated by a
5:36
specific group retail investors using
5:39
social media and this suggests that the
5:41
information advantage came not from
5:43
fundamental analysis but from
5:44
coordinating market action which EMH
5:47
assumes way. And then the investment
5:50
takeaway is that the event validates
5:53
behavioral finance strategy. Uh monitor
5:55
social sentiment and market microructure
5:58
risks like short investment.
6:02
And here's more of just the rationale
6:04
behind this and more of just what I said
6:08
using Google Gemini and Google Collab.
6:11
The
6:14
the R is where we reflect. So the final
6:17
stage is synthesizes all of our findings
6:19
and addresses all of our core concepts
6:23
which these are actually the core
6:24
concepts down below. Market efficiency
6:26
testing, efficient market hypothesis,
6:29
information incorporation, market
6:31
anomalies, behavior biases, asset
6:34
substitution problem, limits to
6:36
arbitrage and EMH implications. So the
6:40
price surge was caused by public past
6:42
short interest data and current social
6:44
media information. But the market
6:46
massively underreacted to the downside
6:48
risk and overreacted to the short
6:51
squeeze potential. So this is a clear
6:54
failure of the EMH forms. So regarding
6:57
the information incorporation is
6:59
information was not instantly but
7:01
explosively driven by collective
7:03
behavior and social media coverage. So
7:06
prices reflected sentiment and short
7:08
interest dynamics but not fundamental
7:11
analyst estimates from like the $10 to
7:13
$40 range.
7:17
So,
7:18
Harding found on Reddit and anchoring
7:21
believing the stock must reach $1,000
7:24
and confirmation bias ignoring
7:26
fundamental warnings drove the buying
7:27
frenzy. So, for the market anomalies,
7:30
the event is an entirely an anomaly. The
7:33
sustained coordinated buying action
7:34
created a momentum effect completely
7:37
divorced from traditional finance
7:39
metrics. So, limits to arbitrage is the
7:42
key enabler. Rational investors like
7:45
hedge funds normally correct
7:47
mispricings. They couldn't have been
7:49
here because of the risk that Melvin's
7:52
capital short position ballooning and
7:55
funding risk need bailout. So arbitrage
7:57
becomes too risky allowing the
8:00
mispricing to persist. So for asset
8:03
substitution problem, Melvin Capitals
8:06
extreme loss exposure created an
8:08
incentive to take the excessive risk of
8:11
holding on to losing position for too
8:12
long because they needed a massive
8:14
return to just survive. And then the EMH
8:18
implications are the behavioral finance
8:20
and how that's essential. So this
8:23
confirms that while markets may be
8:25
mostly efficient, they're susceptible to
8:28
periods of collective irrational
8:30
behavior, especially when micro
8:32
structure factors such as short interest
8:34
and retail platforms are involved. We
8:37
need to integrate the behavioral models
8:39
to understand the modern markets.
8:43
So in summary, the GME short squeeze was
8:46
not a simple market movement. It was a
8:48
perfect storm where technical and market
8:51
structure collided with overwhelming
8:52
social mediadriven sentiment. So it's
8:55
demonstrated that the semi- strong form
8:56
of EMH is fragile when arbitrage is
8:58
limited and that fundamental value be
9:01
can be entirely overridden by the
9:03
coordinated behaviors.

So for the second assignment, uh the
0:05
goal that I'm focusing on is to
0:06
systematically analyze um GameStop short
0:10
squeeze between 2022 2020 and 2021 to
0:13
determine the expected market
0:15
inefficiency and to identify um of
0:18
behavioral finance and market microe
0:26
um in terms of revisiting some of the
0:29
values. The fundamental value for the
0:31
capital value is about 12 to $4 per
0:34
share and the observed market price
0:37
during that time period is about$14
0:40
483 per share as reported on June 28th
0:45
uh 2021 as per finance. So that's the
0:49
question that I'm going to be looking at
0:50
is does the 483 car for share price
0:54
represent rational response to more
0:56
information um uh or investor mania
1:02
findings.
1:04
So I wrote that out and terms of the EMF
1:07
form weak form. The test implication
1:10
would be that past prices cannot predict
1:11
future returns in terms of gain stock.
1:14
the price surge was driven by momentum
1:16
and social media coordinated buying
1:17
patterns. So for this we can conclude
1:20
that probably this this has been
1:22
violated the short-term price if it was
1:24
highly predictable X. Um in terms of the
1:27
semi strong form you could say that the
1:29
the implication would be that public
1:31
fundamental information was priced um in
1:35
this case the price is greater than
1:36
analyst fundamental targets of $40 um
1:40
and public financial.
1:42
So you can assume that it's been
1:43
strongly violated as um
1:47
uh there's a massive sustain price from
1:50
public information.
1:53
In terms of represent
1:56
uh we will use event study methodology
1:59
in the sense of calculating abnormal
2:01
return and the cumulative abnormal
2:04
return during uh the squeeze period of
2:06
2020 21 2020 to 2021 using uh cap to
2:11
establish uh the expected normal return.
2:14
So these are the two formulas that I'm
2:16
going to be using in the stage um where
2:19
um r is the actual daily return in this
2:23
case. of stocks. Um, E of RT is your
2:27
expected daily return
2:29
based on your market data. Uh, a R of T
2:33
is your abnormal return which is your
2:35
alpha and car is your total abnormal
2:38
return over a certain time period.
2:41
Um and just
2:44
uh in terms of interpretation a high
2:46
positive card indicates persistent u
2:49
mispricing and failure of EMH and it in
2:52
terms of alpha uh in terms of the
2:55
abnormal return it should be near zero
2:57
inefficient market and a massive
2:59
positive abnormal return confirms
3:01
inefficiency. The expected return in
3:04
terms of Jamie should be relatively
3:06
small given the normal movement and uh
3:09
the return is massive during just short
3:12
speed considering that it's a peak.
3:16
Um, and the behavioral framework that
3:18
I'm going to be using is going to focus
3:21
on nonrational factors in the sense of
3:23
hurting, which is coordinated buying on
3:26
street ads, anchoring, which is price
3:28
targets like $1,000, which become
3:31
psychological anchors, and limits to
3:33
arbitrage where short sellers or
3:35
rational arbitrers
3:37
are faced like extremely high cost to
3:40
borrow shares, risk margin call as price
3:44
move against them. So like fundamental
3:46
risk towards liquidating risk
3:48
liquidation risk. Um so in terms of the
3:53
influence stage I code and I got this
3:56
output that's so I'm going to be using
3:58
cappo specifically within the
4:01
methodology that I'm using test
4:03
efficiency
4:04
during
4:06
short.
4:08
So in terms of the expected return
4:10
calculation here
4:12
um the column is calculated based on CAM
4:15
and the expected return formula that was
4:18
uh demonstrated here. Um
4:22
so this is the return a riskadjusted
4:24
investor would expect GME to generate
4:28
given the market's movement and high
4:30
systematic risk. um assuming a beta 1.5
4:34
for example in Jan 2027
4:37
the uh if you calculate the market
4:40
return is about 0.10%
4:43
but the expected return is uh 0.5% gives
4:46
you the calculation of 0.01% 1.5 which
4:49
is your beta multiplied by 010%us your
4:53
0.01%
4:55
uh which is approximately 0.5%.
4:59
The abnormal return column here
5:03
um was is the difference between your
5:05
actual return and the expected return.
5:07
It represents market movement and cannot
5:09
be explained by systematic risk or
5:11
rational pricing. Uh again taking Jan 27
5:15
uh Jan 27 as our example
5:19
um the actual return of 134.8% 84% right
5:23
here.
5:25
Subtract that by your expected return of
5:28
5%. You get an abnormal return of
5:31
134.70%.
5:34
Um the large the AR of a single day is
5:37
over about 1,340 times the expected
5:40
rational return. This large unexplained
5:42
return is empirical severe pricing
5:45
disconnect. Um the cumulative abnormal
5:48
return car sounds daily abnormal returns
5:51
over a simulated event period. Say we're
5:53
taking a 5day period from June 25 to
5:55
29th to measure the total particip.
5:59
The car for the simulated 5day period is
6:04
169.43%.
6:08
As shown in this output.
6:10
Um, so you can tell that there's a
6:13
strong violation of a semi- strong EMH.
6:16
In a semi- strong efficient market, the
6:18
abnormal return should be statistically
6:20
indistinguishable
6:22
indistinguishably close to zero because
6:25
all public information like GM
6:27
fundamentals is already priced in the
6:29
mass of sustained and mass and sustained
6:32
profit of 1.43%
6:35
without a doubt as violation of
6:37
accountations occurred. the market is
6:39
not pressed into
6:42
systematic risk. Um
6:45
so in you can also assume that the
6:48
extreme abnormal return is driven by
6:51
nonal factors like mic market
6:54
microructure where the extremely high
6:56
short interest risk created a structural
6:58
vulnerability and behavioral biases
7:01
where retailing and social media moment
7:04
of concepts like
7:11
cause prices to soar far beyond on the
7:13
rational expected return and this
7:16
massive uh cumulative animal returns
7:20
created and sustained by these
7:22
behavioral dynamics and structural
7:24
constraints
7:26
also as limit limits to the arbitrage
7:30
in terms of the validated stage um the
7:34
massive uh
7:37
the massive return is not compensation
7:39
for additional capital it's a genuine
7:42
failure the pricing mechanism but it
7:44
persisted because of limits to
7:46
arbitrage. So in terms of some of the
7:48
limits to we have short selling
7:50
constraints um and its role to GME would
7:54
be it's difficult and expensive for
7:55
national to borrow shares due to high
7:59
borrowing costs to short the overpriced
8:02
stock. And then we have another limit
8:04
called noise. Um the possibility of
8:07
irrational factors for example like the
8:10
Reddit crowd um driving the price even
8:12
higher forcing irrational into
8:15
liquidation and even liquidity risk
8:18
where the sudden trading restrictions by
8:20
brokers like Robin Hood um that is too
8:28
essentially the mispricing was
8:29
economically significant due to the high
8:32
return and statistically significant as
8:35
it's far from zero.
8:36
But the limits to arbitrage of um short
8:39
selling or trade risk and liquidity risk
8:42
prevented its immediate correction
8:44
allowing inefficiency to persist period
8:48
in terms of um evolving uh the markets
8:52
are adaptively efficient efficient
8:55
enough to beat most of the time but
8:57
subject to periods of extreme
8:58
inefficiency when behavioral forces or
9:01
structural con constraints are
9:03
underlined. Um, in terms of looking at
9:06
strategy, you look at like say active
9:08
versus passive. Um, if you look at
9:11
active versus passive, you see that this
9:14
uh short squeeze event mandates a hybrid
9:16
start strategy. Uh, where you
9:18
acknowledge general image use low cost
9:21
index funds and holdings. Um and then
9:24
you selective active management that
9:27
targets um market value of a size or
9:33
behavioral
9:36
um
9:38
for example small cap high interest.
9:41
Um in terms of just like a I would say a
9:44
corporate financial I got would be that
9:46
in terms of cost of capital a CEO of GME
9:49
during this period would realize that
9:50
the market price is irrational. Using
9:53
this artificially inflated stock versus
9:55
capital raising, for example, issuing
9:57
new equity um would be highly
9:59
advantageous, demonstrating how market
10:01
inefficiencies uh impacts corporate
10:04
finance decisions. In terms of
10:06
reflecting, I would say that the GM
10:08
short squeeze is a clear case for
10:10
behavioral finance framework. Um my
10:12
belief in the market efficiency, my
10:14
belief is that market efficiency is
10:16
challenged by uh the GME event because
10:19
it demonstrates social media coding and
10:22
market structure uh which market
10:26
structure fail market microructure
10:28
failures um like extreme short interest
10:32
that can sustain a systematic
10:34
mispricing.
10:36
um for weeks proving that rational
10:38
analysis alone is not uh sufficient when
10:41
faced with extreme behavioral momentum
10:45
um and severe limits to arbitrage um as
10:49
there was in the event. So if we just
10:52
look at the efficient market hypothesis
10:56
uh in terms of the influence of GME the
10:59
price must be fair. So I would say that
11:01
my analysis to this or diverse model
11:04
must have been wrong in the case of J.
11:06
But if you look in terms of behavioral
11:08
finance, the price is bubble by curving
11:11
and um other social behavioral aspects
11:14
like they're missing out and other
11:18
essentially behavioral aspects that are
11:21
sustained by structural limits on
11:22
arbitrage. And I would say this was
11:25
probably the the ideal explanation for
11:28
the short that GM experienced. So I
11:32
would say overall successful investing
11:34
involves respecting the
11:37
constantly seeking behavioral and
11:39
structural weaknesses that create
11:41
exploitable um outite risky
11:43
opportunities.

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,679
section six assignment um market

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,200
efficiency investigation.

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,759
So, just a quick rundown of what the

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
assignment is. Um our overview is

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
basically to investigate market

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,000
efficiency using the GameStop GME stock.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,560
Um it's a short squeeze event from 2020

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
to 2021 as a case study. Um, so we're

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
going to verify the accuracy of stated

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
facts, analyze price behavior related to

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,800
efficiency or efficient market

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
hypothesis predictions, and evaluate

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
whether a market anomalies constitute

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
evidence against market efficiency or

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
can be explained within existing

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,559
frameworks.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,280
Um, so our timeline's right here.

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,680
Our event timeline is 2020. Um, GameStop

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
is near bankrupt bankruptcy.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
Uh, September

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,840
Ryan Cohen, the Chewy founder, acquires

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,399
30% stake. Uh, January 2021, Reddit,

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,760
Wall Street Bets, drives the price up

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,199
and surges to $483. Uh, February 2021,

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,080
congressional hearings on market

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,680
manipulation. Present U postvent price

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,360
stabilization.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,159
Um, and then we have key data points

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,600
which are short interest peaked at 100

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,240
40% a float. Uh, retail trading volume

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,640
increased to 10fold. Um during squeeze

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,880
trading restrictions implemented at peak

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,080
on Robin Hood a hedge fund Melvin

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,960
Capital substained 53% loss requiring

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,920
bailout and analyst fundamental value

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
estimates $10 to $40 per share. So our

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,079
required analysis for this assignment is

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
basically is to one verify all stated

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,840
historical price data and documentation

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
corrections.

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Two, test which form of market

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,200
efficiency, weak, semi- strong, strong,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
strong, was violated. Evaluate whether

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560
rational investors could have profited

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
systematically. Four, compare efficient

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,119
market hypothesis predictions to

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
observed behavior. And five, assess

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,759
behavioral finance explanations for

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
observed anomalies.

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
So, I'm using the driver framework for

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,160
this. And this is basically just the

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,879
text for my driver framework.

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Um

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,520
so starting off to find and discover

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,160
um problem setup and verification

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,879
a a critical value verification

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,080
statement. GameStop traded at 4 cents in

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,160
August of 2020. The stats incorrect. The

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
verified data states that GME's split

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,959
adjusted price in August 2020 was

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,080
approximately $14 to $167.

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,560
Um the analysis proceeds using the

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
verified historical data dollar4 and

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
documents the correction as a critical

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
first step. So basically it's just

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,040
stating that the GameStop price is

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,720
actually wrong. Um

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,879
B event and estimation window definition

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,239
the S&P 500 risk-f free rate

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,440
approximated daily rate for example is

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
0.05 or 232.

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
The estimation period for beta is

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,360
September 1st 2019 to September 1st

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,120
2020. So one year prior

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
and our no hypothesis is basically the

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,640
market is a weak form efficient um with

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
the mean and normal return of zero.

80
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
So that's the find and discover it's our

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,800
problem setup and verification and then

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,799
moving on represent we have um our

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,360
analytical framework and equations.

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,920
So we have a our normal return model

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,680
which is capm equations. Um one capm

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
regression used to estimate alpha and

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
beta during estimation period.

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
And then we have our second equation

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,200
which is expected return. Um and this is

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,959
used to predict normal daily return

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,920
during the event period. Um

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,640
and then for B we have market efficiency

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,159
testing metrics which is basically one

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
are at no return.

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,040
the difference between actual and

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,080
expected return and then two we have

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,120
cumulative uh normal return C which is

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,440
the total total abnormal profit over the

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
event.

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,040
So these are kind of the four equations

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,440
we have our capm regression expected

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,320
return abn normal return and then

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,479
cumulative abnormal return

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,160
we have implement this is basically

105
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,560
where we use our data execution

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,040
calculations um this is all shown in my

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,440
text and code later

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,360
um

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,080
our estimated beta is 1.050

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,960
our max daily

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,000
is 0.85 85 which is 80% abnormal return

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,320
in one day. Um and then our final

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,960
cumulative abnormal rate end of event

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,320
period is 456%

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
total abnormal return.

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
So to validate

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
we have a statistical test which is a

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,080
one sample t test on the mean ar against

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,199
a null mean of zero. Um our conclusion

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,160
is just that the p value of 0.0 is the p

121
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,680
value is less than 0.05 5 which just

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
means um our significant value is less.

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,120
So we reject the null hypothesis and it

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,600
shows that there is um a statistical

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,600
significance here.

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,440
Um there's a this val this is validates

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,080
a strong violation of the weak form.

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
To evolve this

129
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
we could have strategic and policy

130
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
implications.

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Um rational investor profitability or

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,560
policy implications. The extreme air

133
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,120
magnitude and volatility point to severe

134
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,520
market micro structure issues

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,759
specifically related to the 140% short

136
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,600
interest and the subsequent liquid

137
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,600
liquidity risks uh necessating that

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
policy review of short short selling

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
regulations.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
So if you wanted to take this problem

141
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
even further, we could just evolve and

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:12,160
include those two. And then to reflect

143
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,039
I will to reflect um

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,319
this is basically just inclusion.

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,199
So EMH versus behavioral finance the

146
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
statistical rejection of we form EMH is

147
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
best explained by behavioral finance and

148
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
limitations to arbitrage. Um, our

149
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,000
behavioral bias extreme here hurting in

150
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
social media coordination drove the

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,960
price disconnecting it from $10 to $40.

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,960
Fundamental volume estimates uh limits

153
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,039
arbitrage. Rational investors, hedge

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
funds um could not exploit the

155
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,919
mispricing due to high liquidity risks

156
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,919
and the massive forced margin buying

157
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,919
calls allowing the in inefficiency

158
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,880
to persist. Our final conclusion is the

159
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,639
GME event shows that EMH fails under

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,120
conditions of extreme systematic

161
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
shortselling and coordinated behavioral

162
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
action. Um so basically the market was

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
highly ineffective across weak and

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
semi-strong forms.

165
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,199
So this is my

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,680
implement section.

167
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
So one define and discover

168
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,319
we have this is where we define

169
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
everything everything up. We have our

170
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,880
critical val critical factual correction

171
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,880
variable

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,319
04.

173
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,160
Um we define tickers and time windows

174
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,039
right here

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
and then we have implement.

176
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,880
So we retrieve data output is

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,479
multiindex.

178
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
This basically just all of our text that

179
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
does all the work represented right

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
here.

181
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,080
implement

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,080
um here are equations being used.

183
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
So we calculate log returns for the

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,720
event period, calculate expected return

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,120
um for the estimated beta, calculate

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,080
abnormal return and [¬†__¬†] cumulative

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,520
abnormal return and then we display uh

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,400
let me display them and showcase them at

189
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,039
the end. So they're right here.

190
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,080
So to kind of cover this basically we

191
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,360
have an OS regression results. Um our

192
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,520
dependent variable is GME excess return.

193
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,639
Our model is OS.

194
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Here's the date and time numbers.

195
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,080
So our R square is 0.139.

196
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,840
Our adjusted R square is 0.135.

197
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,840
These are both very low. are.

198
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,800
So our constant is 0.020 and our market

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,160
return is 1.04. So this is basically our

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,120
slope and this is our starting value.

201
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,959
Um

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
if we take our market excess from our

203
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,959
coefficient and go to our p value, we

204
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,720
can clearly see that our p value is less

205
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,920
than our alpha, which that just again

206
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
goes to show that we reject the null

207
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,720
hypothesis. Um and that there is

208
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,440
statistical evidence that GME was

209
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,440
affected by social media.

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,959
And this is what this this is just our

211
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:29,040
abnormal return. and C calculation.

212
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,839
So our final cumulative abnormal return

213
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,839
C end of the day CR GME was 25069.

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,839
So this is my data um in my results. So

215
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,680
basically I also made three visuals to

216
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,080
help see this. Um right here we have GME

217
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,920
versus S&P 500 daily log returns um

218
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
during event period. This visual

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
demonstrates the daily volatility of GME

220
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,680
returns compared to the market,

221
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,800
especially during the squeeze. So, this

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,519
red line is the squeeze. Our black is

223
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,640
the S&P and GME log return. As you can

224
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,640
see, it's just super static. And then up

225
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,839
here, our log return shoots to over

226
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,839
0.75, which is insane.

227
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,880
Um, here's our dates.

228
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,480
And then I also have one here.

229
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
Um this visual clearly shows the

230
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,240
accumulation of abnormal returns crucial

231
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,720
for asset market efficiency.

232
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
So once again this is our peak squeeze

233
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
and this is our zero abnormal return and

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,720
this is our GE cumulative abnormal

235
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,079
return. Um as you can see it's

236
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,120
constantly positive and it continues to

237
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,120
grow all the way till our squeeze.

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
And then here's a bell curve that we

239
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
have. And this histogram shows the

240
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,760
frequency of different normal return

241
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
values. Um a distri a distribution

242
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,240
heavily skewed away from the zero

243
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,880
suggests inefficiency.

244
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,839
So our mean return is 0.0205

245
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,839
and this is zero AR.

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
And yeah,

247
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,160
um

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,920
that's my project. And basically to sum

249
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,200
it up, um

250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,399
we verified our document corrections in

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
the historical price. So historical

252
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,160
price is off. It was not 0104, but 1.04.

253
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Um we test our forms of market

254
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,920
efficiency. We evaluated whether

255
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,519
rational investors could have profited

256
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,640
systematically.

257
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,320
um rational investors

258
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,279
um could not have given that it was

259
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,720
squeezed and shorted. Um and we compare

260
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,560
efficient market hypothesis predictions

261
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
to observed behavior and we assess

262
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,640
behavioral finance explanations for

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,760
observed anomalies.

264
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"So for session eight's assignment, we have

to investigate market efficiency using GameStop short squeeze events from 2020 to 2021 as a case study. We use all these event timelines from August, September, January, February, and the present post using a Yahoo Finance that we tried to incorporate into some of the codes over here. And so first off, we do the GameStop trade at 4 cents in August 2020. According to uh Yahoo Finance data that we pulled, the minimum closing price in August 2020 would be $14. The maximum closing price would be $167. The average closing price would be $120. Over here they provided a visual graph as well. And then uh some event timeline notes on the key dates. We see um basically

first trading day on from on January 27th with the closing price would be uh $86.88 at the height of the Reddit squeeze February when congressional hearings began it's $56.25 25 September 2020 at 13% stake with Brian Cohen that acquires $1.91 and uh the near bankruptcy level will be $14. Over here they provided another graph as well. Now over here we estimate the market efficiency the uh abnormal return abnormal return I think that is it says it over here actually provides us exactly what uh that stands for. Yep. abnormal return

and then um

cumulative abnormal return as well for the C and the return under market model calculates everything right here. So the alpha results are 011730 the beta will be 1.603 603. That means that on average, GameStop earned about 1.17% per day. Independent of the market, it moves about 1.6 times more aggressively than the S&P 500. As you can see, uh shows all the regression results as well. A sample of abnormal returns for the first five days of January. These numbers are basically used later to compute expected returns and the abnormal returns as well.

So the final cumulative normal return at the end of event window would be 1.7385.

That's the final one. And then the peak at the peak it reached about 3.24 here as it states GameStop shows large abnormal returns and then C that picked around 3.24

that basically means that GameStop's community of abnormal performance during the peak of the squeeze was more than three times greater than what the market model actually predicted. And then um over here we had done a fact check with like summarizing everything and then we do uh now we're calculating the significance of all these baseline volumes. We're calculating the volumes for GameStop profitability and everything else mentioned. So the baseline volume from November to December 2020 would be 39 million 39.3 million shares. We'll just break that number down and uh sum it up. And the peak volume from January to February of 2021 is 788.6 million shares. So the volume multiplier would be 20.1 times the average daily volume.

Well, it's a 20 times increase in volume and it's extreme and cannot be explained by fundamentals. So, the behav behavior is consistent with hurting, fear of missing out, social mediadriven coordination, overconfidence and narrative driven trading. All of these fall under behavioral finance and not the uh EMH

over here just summarized everything else. So the limits to uh let's see if we can find it. See if I can find it. Okay. Boom. The limits to arbitrage and micro structure notes basically talks about the squeeze persisted longer than EMH would predict because rational traders faced extreme barriers. Short interest was over 140%. But borrow fees were very high. Short sellers faced a limited loss risk. Robin Hood restricted buying. Circuit breakers repeatedly halted trading. Order flow was massively imbalanced as well. These all limit these are all limits to arbitraries that prevented informed traders from correcting mispricing. Then you got rational investor profitability.

So um could a rational investor have made systematic profits? X ante would show no predictable signal, extreme volatality and high risk of catastrophic losses. And so this means there was no easy systematic strategy for an investor to earn abnormal returns with good risk adjusted performance. Basically there was no safe strategy to profit consistently. Then the expost after the squeeze basically saying uh some traders made huge gains but only by taking the lottery level risk. Therefore, the event does not show a repeatable violation of EMH. Then over here, you have the EMH versus behavioral finance where the EMH holds market absorbed new uh info quickly and prices were corrected shortly after the peak. And where the EMA breaks is where uh extreme deviation from fundamentals, persistent abnormal returns, and mass behavioral hurting. The behavioral finance explains why investors acted irrationally, why prices were overshot, why the squeeze spiraled out of control, why the arbitrage couldn't fix it quickly. the GM and the GameStop event shows both efficient information information processing and behaviorally driven mispricing as well. So for the final conclusion for all of this basically is that the 4 cents price claim was proven false. GameStop traded between $14 and $167. They experienced massive abnormal returns and a C peak of 3.24. The volume surged by 20 times showing extreme hurting. Behavioral biases and social media were central to the squeeze. Limits to arbitraries prevented early correction. Abnormal returns were not significant. So, EMH couldn't be formally rejected. But the behaviorally the market was clearly inefficient. So overall, the events highlight a market where information processed quickly, but human behavior overpowered the fundamentals, creating one of the clearest examples of temporary market inefficiency in modern history. And yeah, so here are just the rest of the results. I told it to summarize everything else. Basically all that we talked about the key event prices, market model parameters, the t statistic and the p value. Yeah, that is all. Pretty simple. Got it done.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Okay, so this is my session eight assignment over GameStop or GME. Um, so first the assignment overview. Um, basically the assignment was to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop GME short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as the case study. Um the first thing was to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis or EMH predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So the first step of this is to make sure that the data we were um provided is accurate. So, um, just seeing if GameStop GameStop being traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is an accurate statement. And then here are some of the events that we're also going to make sure are correct and the key data points so that our analysis is thorough and correct. And then here are the four questions we're going to answer kind of overall regarding this case. So first I'm going to go to the define and the discover. So our first step of this was um doing the critical first step and based off um market search of the history of GameStop's GME stock on public sites including Yahoo Finance Stapus and S3 the SEC references. In August 2020 the range of um its stock price was 120 to 180 per stock. Um so very far off from the 4 cents um number presented in this problem. Um the way I would communicate this information to the professor um I would show all the sites with opposing information and it's most likely that the professor just made like a small error or typo when including this information for the assignment um from the case study. So not a big deal. I will just continue working on this assignment and make sure all the other data um that is provided is correct before implementing it into my analysis. So um here is my verification and clarification of all the events and then also the extra data we got for this assignment. So August 2020 near bankrupt levels um this was true. they were um selling their stock at a low singledigit dollar and that is obviously not going to cut it for a big company. Um Ryan Cohen stake um RC Ventures disclosed an initial 9 to 10% in stake and later increasing at 12.9. So he did have around 13% um in holdings but it wasn't until um December of 2020. So small um error there but not too bad. um January 2021 um the price surge did happen. Um one thing with this is that the 483 is before the split. So posts split after a 4 in1 split in 2020 it was more around 120 which you can find on Yahoo Finance as well. Um February 2021 the congressional hearings um did happen and that was correct. present and postevent stabilization. Um the price volatality reduced and the stock settled to a range much lower um in January, but GME did experience additional meme um driven episodes later. Um so we'll get into that a little later. And then key data points that were verified/corrected where needed were short interest um peaked at 140% of float. Um this is supported. This is true. Found this on multiple sites. And then retail trading volume increased um tfold during freeze. Um this is basically correct. It was about 10. It kind of ranged based on the site to like 10 to I think it was 16, but overall um pretty much that trading restrictions implemented at peak um the Robin Hood this is correct. Melvin Capital sustained 53% loss required. Bella this is correct. and anal analyst fundamental value estimates 10 to 40. Um this is a plausible range for this um stock. So moving on um the object objective of this assignment is to test whether market prices for GME during 2020 and 2021 episode reflected available information um forms of EMH or instead displayed persistent predictable mispricing that rational traders could exploit. Um, did GME return around the short squeeze? How abnormal returns relative to market model using the efficient market hypothesis EMH? And then were those abnormal returns predictable? Um, using publicly available signals semi- strong or past returns weak. Um, so then this is some more information. were observed patterns better explained by behavioral slash microstructure frictions limits to and then that's just some examples than by fundamental information. So we're going to take a look into that. Um in this case it is hard to test market efficiency because it's unclear what new fundamental info um justified price changes and price shouldn't move on herd behavior or viral momentum. and the 140% short interest created a mechanical feedback loop causing forced buying by shorts um inflated prices independent of new info making it hard to identify the true cause of this price increase. Then also the fail falling back to normal prices could be viewed in two ways. Confirm it could confirm in eventual information efficiency prices corrected or show overcorrection and correction suggesting temporary inefficiency. So for the represent stage um quality framework for analyzing efficiency around specific events. So, uh, I wanted to implement the abnormal return calculation because this is a great formula to kind of put our put this stock into a test and see like how it comes out. And then we're going to do the ME or market efficiency analysis with the EMH uh, weak semi- strong and strong analysis. And I'll show you that in the code. And then behavioral finance analysis. Identify the key human biases that drove the price back into 2020 to be this high. and also how it came down. Um, rational profitability analysis, determine if this was a rational investment or a gamble based on the information found. So, we're going to go through all of that. So, next is the implement stage. Um, here is kind of the prompt that I used. Um, create code using Python that will show visuals of our data. Um, I provided the data that I was provided below using the price and volume of GME stock across times and then also evaluate this information with the abnormal return calculation and the EMA testing to see if the stock fails or succeeds and give me a simplified answer for the following questions. Test which form of market efficiency, weak, semi- strong, and strong was violated. evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically, compare efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior, and assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies. So now I'm going to show you the Gemini input I had and then the code that came along with that. So that is basically I just kind of set it. Um, so I just kind of put that into Google Gemini and then also uh pasted in some of the information provided for this assignment plus my corrected um finds in the data. So then this created this code which I ran and so first it kind of just gets grabs the data from Yahoo Finance about um the 2020 and 2021 information on GME like the prices and so then um first it calculated abnormal returns which is this part of the stock um and then it also did cumulative abnormal return um for a part of it too. And then it used this information to make um a plot which I'll show you down below. And then it also answered all four of the questions that are kind of the overall um questions for this assignment which I said earlier. So here are the results. So GM short squeeze EMHK study evaluation. So the total cumulative abnormal return is 155.74%. And total stock return over a period was 400%. And so if you see this um this is kind of the you can see it's fluctuating a lot not very steady which is not a good sign. Um and then this is days relative to start of observation. So there's that. And then the EMH qual qualitative analysis. um which form of market efficiency was violated. This event violated the semi- strong form of market effic efficiency and then by extension the weak form. So semi- strong violation the strong the stock prices soared to 400 plus despite the publicly known fundamental value estimates of only 10 to 40 per share. The market failed to rationally incorporate public and fundamental information. And then weak form violation. The massive gains confirmed by um our car analysis demonstrate that the past price and volume data like extreme like the extreme short interest could have only been used to earn market beating returns. So question two, evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. No, not systematically in the long term. So initial profits only those who recognized the structural anomaly the massive short interest had um a systematic trade um peak profit peak profit analysis capturing the peak abnormal returns the final spike required ignoring fundamental value and relying on momentum and crowd psychology which is not systematic or rational um in terms of stocks. And then question three, compare efficient market hypothesis, EMH predictions to observe behavior. Um, EMH prediction. Um, so the price reach 400 plus ignoring blah blah blah. So this is basically um just showing how they all failed. So the price um liquidity liquidity so and it shows the trade was restricted by brokers which is the Robin Hood um effect. So question four, assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies. So hurting in social proof buying was driven by massive retail coordination on social media creating a self-reinforcing momentum that ignored the fundamentals framing effect. The trade was framed as a revenue or revenge trade against institutional hedge funds. Um, this emotional satisfaction and desire to punish a perceived enemy outweighed the rational fear of loss for most clients. And then limited arbitrage, sorry, I can't say that word. Sophisticated short sellers, arbitrageers who knew the stock was overvalued were prevented from correcting the price due to high cost and risk associated with finding shares to short. So that is the analysis we got from the code and kind of how the code explains um all of these informations um as I showed it used the um the abnormal function that I entered in for it to use um to find that graph. So now um validate um our validation is that all information was validated using Yahoo Finance, the SEC references and also um chat GBT and then um the answers to this code are also apparent in the teachings um on this class subject and how the vitality of this doc kind of shows the behavioral aspects. So evolve. Um so I'm this kind of explains what was demonstrated in the stock behaviorally. So the hurting bandwagon effect um as I said people bought JA because they saw others doing it. It was a viral trend yada yada. Um confirmation bias investors focused only on posts that confirmed their to the moon belief ignoring other fundamental data that showed the stock was dangerously overvalued. And then limits to arbitrage market failure. Rational traders couldn't stop the bubble. Shorting was too risky, infinite losses, and trading platforms like Robin Hood broke the markets mechanics by halting buying. So for my reflection, this case is a perfect example of how markets do not always act rationally or how they are predicted to react. Clearly shows how the efficient market hypothesis can fail in certain scenarios considering the price wasn't just driven by fundamental data, but also by behavioral factors of humans. just showing how humans can make mistakes in these kinds of scenarios. Humans in this case fell to the mistake of hurting and following the crown. And this shows the idea that market sentiment can be a huge factor in the change of stocks. So that is my analysis on this case study. And yeah.",,0,1

0:04
and let's hop into the assignment
0:06
overview. So we're going to investigate
0:08
market efficiency using the GameStop,
0:10
which is ticker symbols GME, uh short
0:13
squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case
0:16
study. We're going to verify the
0:17
accuracy of stated facts, analyze price
0:20
behavior relative to efficient market
0:22
hypothesis predictors, and evaluate
0:25
whether market anomalies constitute
0:28
evidence against market efficiency or
0:30
can be explained within existing
0:32
frameworks. So our critical first step
0:34
is we're going to verify the statement
0:36
GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020
0:40
against actual historical data. If
0:42
incorrect document the accurate figures
0:44
and determine appropriate communication
0:46
approach for correcting the professor.
0:49
So um we have some other points here. We
0:52
have the invent timeline. So we have
0:53
August 2020 GME near bankruptcy levels.
0:56
September 2020 Ryan Cohan Chewy founder
0:59
acquires 13% stake. January 2021 Reddit
1:04
um/wall street bets uh driven price
1:07
surge to $483.
1:09
February of 2021 congressional hearing
1:11
on market manipulation and and present
1:14
postevent price stabilization.
1:17
We also have some key data points that
1:19
we will be touching on more on the
1:21
assignment. So let's just get right into
1:22
our driver framework. So we're going to
1:25
use driver analysis um to analyze the
1:28
GameStop short squeeze and market
1:30
efficiency
1:32
um stuff about the market. So first
1:35
we're going to jump into define
1:36
discover. though one define the problem.
1:39
So the objective is to analyze the 2020
1:42
to 2021 GameStop GME short squeeze as a
1:46
case study for market efficiency. Um in
1:48
this an anal analyst we must verify all
1:52
state historical data points using the
1:54
provided data test event against the
1:56
forms of efficient market hypothesis
1:58
also known as EMH incor and incorporate
2:02
behavioral finance explanations. We need
2:05
to evaluate the potential for systematic
2:07
rational profit and then we need to use
2:09
the provided Python code for the
2:10
analysis.
2:12
So for the assignment's critical first
2:15
step um it is to verify the statement
2:17
the games that GameStop traded at 0.04
2:21
in August 2020 uh using the provided
2:23
data. So the statement um the statement
2:26
is again GME traded at 0.04 in August
2:30
2020. The verdict on the statement is
2:32
incorrect. Um, we found that using the
2:35
provided GameStop stock sheet, which is
2:38
just a file that was taken from Yahoo
2:41
Finance, um, that included, um, January
2:44
1st, 2020 to January 1st, 2022, uh, we
2:48
found that the actual lowest price GME
2:50
traded at in August 2020 was $1. So, the
2:53
professor's 0.04 figure is incorrect. So
2:57
the communication approach to this is
2:59
that the professor's data point appears
3:01
to be a typo and uh this analysis will
3:05
pro proceed using the verified
3:07
historical figures from the provide
3:09
file. So we will just let the professor
3:11
know that it was a typo. So uh statement
3:15
um the price surged to $483 in January
3:19
2021. So this statement is partially
3:22
correct but a little bit of a data
3:24
mismatch. Um the verification for this
3:26
is the provided CSV file shows a peak
3:29
high of $120.75
3:32
on 2021. Um and um the widely reported
3:37
$483 was the pre-split intraday high.
3:41
The data in your files postsplit, so
3:44
after a 44 for one split in 2022. Um the
3:47
data is correct, but it's important to
3:49
note it's posts split. So we'll use the
3:51
files $120.75
3:53
peak.
3:55
The next statement short interest peaked
3:57
at 140% of float. The verdict is
4:00
correct. This statement is correct. Um
4:02
this data is not in the CSV but is
4:04
confirmed by external reports from S3
4:06
partners and was the central catalyst
4:08
for the event. And then the last
4:10
statement um that Melvin's capital
4:12
sustained 53% loss. This is correct. Um
4:16
this is also a well doumented external
4:18
fact uh not present in the price data
4:21
but crucial for the events context. So
4:24
now that we know um which statements are
4:26
correct, we can represent and come with
4:28
a analytical plan for approaching this
4:31
situation. So for our technical
4:33
implementation, we're going to use the
4:35
approved Python script to load, clean,
4:37
and sort the GameStop stock sheet. Um,
4:41
and we're going to generate a two panel
4:43
plot of price and volume to visually
4:46
confirm the event. Then we're going to
4:48
have a market efficiency analysis. Um,
4:51
and this is going to test the event
4:53
against the three forms of EMA, EMH,
4:56
which is weak, semi- strong, and strong.
4:58
We're also going to have behavioral
5:00
finance analysis where we're going to
5:01
identify the key human biases that drove
5:04
the price. Then we will have a rational
5:06
profitability analysis where we're going
5:08
to determine if this was a rational
5:09
investment or a gamble. So now that we
5:12
represent and have a plan for analyzing
5:14
all this, let's go into the implement
5:16
stage. Um we're first going to uh look
5:19
at the technical analysis with a Python
5:21
imple imple implementation.
5:25
Um this code reads your um our GameStop
5:28
sheet file and cleans the data and plots
5:31
the price and volume on charts to see.
5:34
And the prompt we use is that um um we
5:38
use have it uh read this Excel sheet
5:40
with the Yahoo finance data to get the
5:42
data and then successfully create Python
5:44
code for price data analysis. Have it
5:47
explain what the output means and keep
5:49
it simple, not over complicated. So
5:51
using this data um we got the uh code
5:55
from Google Gemini and then put it in
5:57
Google Collab. So here on the steps you
6:00
can see it uses the pan pandas python
6:04
library. It then uses um data cleaning
6:07
to fix the column names convert um some
6:10
of the column um to uh actual objects
6:15
and then it sorts um the um data by date
6:18
in reverse order. And then it basically
6:21
has code for plotting it. So this output
6:24
gives us two charts. Um um one um has
6:28
the price USD on the xax or the y- axis
6:32
and the other has the volume on the y-
6:34
axis and both are the x is the dates. So
6:37
from 2020 um month of September all the
6:41
way up or January all the way up. So
6:44
what what does this plot tell us about
6:46
gametock stock? So this plot shows two
6:49
main things about GameStop stock over
6:50
time. The top part with the stock price
6:53
um also known as closing price. Um the
6:56
line given shows how the price of one
6:58
share of GME changed each day when the
7:00
market closed. When the line goes up,
7:02
the price went up and then when it goes
7:04
down, the price went down. So looking at
7:06
this line helps us see the stock's
7:07
history and if it's generally going up,
7:09
down or staying around the same. Now the
7:12
bottom part shows how much the stock was
7:14
traded. the volume. These bars show how
7:16
many shares of GME were bought and sold
7:18
each day. Uh taller bars mean a lot of
7:20
shares were traded that day and shorter
7:22
bars mean fewer shares were traded. And
7:24
high volume often happens when something
7:26
important is happening with the stock
7:28
like big news or a lot of people are
7:30
interested in buying or selling. So now
7:32
we're going to put it all together. So
7:33
what it means for looking at prices. So
7:36
prices move with interest. When the
7:37
price goes up or down a lot, look at the
7:39
volume. If the volume is also high, it
7:41
means a lot of people were buying or
7:43
selling, which makes that price move
7:45
more important. Busy times. So big uh
7:49
spikes in both the price and volume tell
7:50
us um there were very busy and often
7:53
exciting or stressful times for the
7:55
stock. This is where major events likely
7:57
happen. Understanding the energy volume
8:00
helps us understand the energy behind a
8:01
price change. A small price change on
8:03
huge volume is different from a small
8:05
price change on tiny volume. So um to
8:08
think about all this uh think of it like
8:10
this. The price is what the stock did
8:13
and the volume is how much people cared
8:15
about doing it. Analyzing both together
8:18
gives us a better picture of the stock
8:19
story. This is a simple look and is
8:22
financial advice.
8:24
Um so now let's go to our other analysis
8:28
now that we can see the stock in volume
8:30
and this kind of uh uses all this data
8:32
and tests some stuff. So market
8:35
efficiency testing the GME event
8:37
violated all three forms of efficient
8:39
market hypothesis. So the weak form
8:41
failed. Um this form says past data like
8:44
price can't predict future moves. It
8:46
failed because retail investors use
8:48
public historical short interest data at
8:50
140% to predict the squeeze. The
8:53
semi-rong form failed um because the
8:55
form says all public news is priced in.
8:58
It failed because the 140% short
9:00
interest was public for months yet the
9:02
market ignored it. Then when the news
9:04
went viral, the market overreacted with
9:06
a hyped driven price $120 far beyond
9:09
fundamentals.
9:10
The strong form failed. Um this form
9:13
says even smart money can't break the
9:15
market. It failed because smart money
9:17
hedge funds like the Melvin Capital was
9:20
spectacularly lo uh wrong, lost billions
9:23
and was beaten by retail crowd. So now
9:26
let's go to the behavioral finance
9:27
analysis. So if the market wasn't
9:30
rational, it was behavioral driven by
9:32
human psych logology. So hurting uh
9:36
bandwagon effect. So people bought GME
9:39
because they uh saw others on uh Wall
9:42
Street Bets doing it. It became a social
9:44
movement, us versus them kind of
9:46
narrative rather than an individual
9:48
investment. Um there's confirmation
9:51
bias. So investors focus only on posts
9:54
that confirm their to the moon belief
9:56
ignoring all the other fundamental data
9:58
that showed that uh the stock was
10:00
dangerously overvalued
10:03
and then limits to our arbitrage uh
10:06
market failure uh rational traders
10:09
couldn't stop the bubble shorting was
10:11
too risky infinite losses and trading
10:13
platforms like Robin Hood uh broke the
10:16
market's mechanics by halting buying.
10:18
Now lastly, the rational profitability
10:20
analysis um shows that it was a gamble,
10:23
not a rational investment. A rational
10:25
investor buys based on the company's
10:27
future earnings. No one believed GME's
10:30
earnings justified a $1 to $20 price.
10:33
People bought at the peak were
10:34
speculating, not investing. They were
10:36
betting they could sell to a greater
10:38
fool at a higher price before the bubble
10:40
burst. This was not a systematic
10:43
repeatable strategy.
10:45
So now that we've seen the imple
10:47
implement stage, let's uh verify
10:49
validate everything. So data code
10:52
verified, the Python code uh we
10:54
successfully ran and the resulting plot
10:56
verifies the core event by visually
10:58
confirming the simul uhacious uh
11:02
explosive spike in both price and
11:04
volume. EMH failure verified. The
11:07
failure of all three EMH forms is
11:09
verified. The squeeze was predicted from
11:11
the past data a week and the market
11:14
overreacted to to public news which is
11:17
why semi-strong failed and smart money
11:19
was proven wrong which is why strong
11:21
failed. So the conclusions verified um
11:24
all findings are logically consistent.
11:26
The EMH failures verifies that a
11:29
behavioral explanation is necessary and
11:31
that the vent was a speculative gamble
11:34
not a rational investment.
11:36
So what's this all result in? What's the
11:39
what's the final conclusion? So the
11:42
final conclusion is that the GameStop
11:44
event is a perfect case study of how
11:46
markets are not always rational. It
11:48
clearly shows that the efficient market
11:50
hypothesis can fail. The price driven uh
11:53
was driven not by efficient an analysis
11:56
of data but by human behavioral factors
11:59
like hurting and hype and market
12:01
structure failures uh like limits to
12:04
abbit rage, arbitrage. Um so overall
12:08
this event proves that market sentiment
12:10
is not just noise but can be a powerful
12:12
price moving force.
12:15
So thank you for listening to this
12:17
assignment. Um that is our analysis of
12:20
uh GameStop stock and the short squeeze
12:23
event of 2021 or of 2020 into 2021. Hope
12:27
you enjoy it. Have a good day.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Jorge Navarro and this
is my video presentation for the Market
Efficiency Investigation assignment for
Management 310. My analysis uses the
GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021
as a real world test of the Efficient
Market Hypothesis evaluated using the
six-stage DRIVER framework. In this
video, I walk through each DRIVER
stage in order while explaining
the outputs and findings generated by my
Python script that I have created.
So, let's begin with um stage one of
DRIVER.
And um this is the first stage right
here. This is the code of it. Um the
Define and Discover stage establishes
the research foundation before any
implementation. Um so I began by
verifying the assignment's critical
first claim which was that GameStop
traded at $0.04 cents in August 2020. So
using Yahoo Finance historical price
data, adjusted for the 4:1 split, my
script confirms that this is incorrect.
As you can see down here in the output,
my script confirms that this is
incorrect.
Um, August 2020 prices ranged from
approximately $1.04 to $1.67,
with the lowest price of all 2020 being
$0.85 cents in April, not $0.04 cents. So, this
corrects the prompt's error by a factor
of about 25. So, next I define the
research questions and hypothesis.
Weak-form EMH prediction: no predictable
returns from past price or volume data.
Semi-strong EMH prediction: publicly
available information uh short interest
greater than 140%, Ryan Cohen's
acquisition, fundamental estimates, should
be efficiently incorporated. Strong-form
EMH prediction: is that all public and
private information should already be
reflected in price. I also identified
the alternative hypothesis which is
behavioral factors such as herding,
sentiment amplification, overconfidence,
and narrative-driven trading, may better 
explain the event especially when combined 
with limits to arbitrage. This completes the define and
discover stage before any of the code is
executed itself um past the
define and discover stage.
So now let's go to stage two of DRIVER
which is um Represent and in this stage
um this is where I document the
analytical plan laying out the technical
road map um and I structured the project
as follows.
So first as you can see right here um I
downloaded the daily price and volume
data for GME and the S&P 500 index. I
computed daily log returns, CAPM-based
expected returns, abnormal returns, and
cumulative abnormal returns or CAR. Um I
define the pre-event, event, and post-event
windows. Then I performed statistical
diagnostics, including return
autocorrelation
uh volatility patterns, and
distribution checks. I also generated
three primary visualizations um the log
-scale adjusted price, daily volume, and
CAR, and then the pre-script structured
outputs for the Validate, Evolve, and uh
Reflect stages so that each stage is
evidence-based and analytically
grounded.
So, by establishing a rigorous event
study approach at this stage, the
analysis aligns fully with the DRIVER
requirement that Represent must proceed
before Implementation.
So now what we're going to do is head
over to the Implementation stage of
DRIVER or stage three. And as you can
see in the code here, this is 
where the script executes the
full analytical plan that I created.
After downloading the historical data
successfully, the script prints
descriptive statistics confirming the
the corrected August 2020 price range.
The script also confirms that the split
adjusted peak price during the squeeze
is $120.75.
And that is confirmed down here in the
output um as you can see right here.
And um this corresponds exactly to the
pre-split high of $483,
validating consistency between raw and
adjusted data sets.
So now let's go to the um to the
visualization outputs that I have
created. So um we have a log-scale price
chart showing the extreme price shift
which is over a 100 times change and
then a volume chart showing a spike over
10 times the prior average um
corroborating the surge in retail
attention.
So what I've done is to strengthen the
statistical rigor, I also examined
autocorrelation returns (lag-1
autocorrelation). Um, the value was
statistically small and not strongly
significant, demonstrating that
predictable patterns in returns were
limited. Moreover, abnormal returns
during the squeeze period significantly
exceeded the standard deviation of
returns in normal-market windows,
confirming that deviations fell far
outside typical noise levels. These
results provide quantitative evidence
essential for the Validation stage. So,
here are the outputs that provide that
information and um as you can see here
is the peak of $86 and then I have the
red which um the red highlighted part
which correlates the two. So
now let's move on to stage four which is
Validate
and um in Validate I interpret database
results against EMH predictions. So
first we have Weak-form efficiency.
Autocorrelation tests show um low and
inconsistent predictability. While
momentum appeared during the extreme
volatility, it did not provide reliable
risk-adjusted opportunities. Therefore,
there is no strong statistical violation
of weak-form EMH.
And uh this is all said down here in my
output for um for validate stage right here. Then
we have um Semi-strong form efficiency
and this form shows the clearest
failure. Key information, publicly known
short interest, Ryan Cohen's stake, and
fundamental valuation ranges, was
available months before the surge. Yet
prices did not incorporate this
information efficiently. CAR results
confirm the presence of large abnormal
returns exceeding historical volatility
bands. The delayed reaction to
well-known public information
constitutes a direct semi-strong-
form violation. Then we have Strong-form
efficiency. Strong form EMH fails
automatically if semi-strong fails.
Additionally, the magnitude of abnormal
returns, many standard deviations above
expected levels, confirms that all
information was not fully reflected in
prices.
So now let's go down to the Evolve
stage. And um in this stage I have
explained that EMH alone cannot fully
explain the GME event. Stage five
integrates behavioral finance and market
microstructure insights. Um herding
behavior was visible via coordinated
retail sentiment on social media which
is uh ""Apes together strong,"" or ""HODL,""
and overconfidence surfaced among
traders who believe sentiment alone
could sustain price increases.
Confirmation bias reinforced bullish
narratives and filtered out
contradictory information. The most
important factor is limits to arbitrage.
Even if rational investors recognized
mispricing, they cannot reliably correct
it because: 
shares became extremely difficult to
borrow. Volatility drove margin
requirements sky-high. Short sellers
faced unlimited potential losses, and
trading restrictions, like Robin Hood
halts, prevented timely arbitrage. So
therefore, ex-ante predictable profits
for rational investors were not
systematically available. The event
produced extraordinary ex-post profits
for some traders, but without predictable
risk-adjusted signals ahead of time.
So now let's go to the final stage of
DRIVER, which is Reflect and this is my
synthesis and conclusion. In this stage,
I synthesized the full analytical
process. The investigation began with
verifying a factual error in the prompt
and proceeded through a rigorous event-
study methodology built on DRIVER. The
findings show that while financial
markets are generally efficient,
extreme psychological, structural, and
microstructural conditions can
cause temporary but large deviations
from fundamental value. GME's short
squeeze represents a clear breakdown of
semi-strong efficiency. Integrating EMH
with behavioral and structural
explanations provide the most accurate
understanding. Overall, the DRIVER
framework enabled a structured,
data-driven evaluation, connecting market
theory, empirical results, and real-
world complexities. And this concludes
my video presentation on this um
investigation for Management 310. Thank
you.

",FALSE,1,"0:00:00.480,0:00:05.280
Hey guys, welcome back. It's Justin here. So 
today, let's move on to the market efficiency

0:00:05.280,0:00:12.960
investigation. So today I'm going to talk 
about the GME which is GameStop company.

0:00:12.960,0:00:17.360
So the purpose of this project is to use the 
GameStop short squeeze as a real world test

0:00:17.360,0:00:22.880
of market efficiency. Instead of just relying on 
theory, right? I want to see how GME actual price

0:00:22.880,0:00:28.560
behavior lines up with the different forms of the 
efficient market hypothesis and how much of the

0:00:28.560,0:00:33.600
story is better explained by behavioral finance 
and limits to arbitrage. So in simple terms,

0:00:33.600,0:00:40.160
did the market act efficiently during GME or did 
it break in predictable ways? To answer that,

0:00:40.160,0:00:44.400
I first need a clean accurate picture of what 
actually happened. That's where discover and

0:00:44.400,0:00:49.600
defiance comes in. So in the discover and define 
stage, I start by making sure the basic story and

0:00:49.600,0:00:58.080
data for GMBB are correct. One key example is the 
claim that GME traded at $0.04 in August 2020.

0:00:58.080,0:01:04.720
When I check split adjusted price, I found that 
GM was around $1 to $2 that month with a closing

0:01:04.720,0:01:13.440
price of around $1.67 on August 31st. So that the 
0.01 number is simply wrong. And that's why I'm

0:01:13.440,0:01:18.960
building everything on verified data instead of 
just copying the statements. So to organize the

0:01:18.960,0:01:26.720
event, I create a simple timeline in Python. You 
can see the table here. So first um I define a

0:01:26.720,0:01:32.640
list called events. Each row on this list has 
three different uh pieces which is the date,

0:01:32.640,0:01:38.400
a short event label and a brief description 
about it. So for example, I have one row of

0:01:38.400,0:01:44.640
order August 31st. You can see here which is the 
price check and another one for the RC ventures

0:01:44.640,0:01:52.160
this one. So and another one for December state 
increases. So I have basically everything here

0:01:52.160,0:01:58.320
and this is the table of it. I convert that list 
into a data frame with this line you can see here.

0:01:58.320,0:02:06.320
This is very important and that's how I got this 
table because um now I can easily sort print and

0:02:06.320,0:02:11.760
refer back to it and when I display timeline BFF 
the output is a clean table with one row per key

0:02:11.760,0:02:18.000
event. That table is basically my master timeline. 
It shows when khan increased his states when he

0:02:18.000,0:02:24.560
joined the board when the squeeze pack when the 
squeeze p and when trading was restricted. So I'll

0:02:24.560,0:02:30.560
use those data later to define at event windows 
and line up my abnormal return calculation. So

0:02:30.560,0:02:37.440
let's move on to the represent part. So in the 
represent stage I focus on the design of the

0:02:37.440,0:02:42.560
analysis rather than on actual calculation. Here 
I'm answering the question which is how exactly

0:02:42.560,0:02:48.720
am I going to test the market efficiency using the 
GME timeline. So the first thing I do is create a

0:02:48.720,0:02:54.240
table that links each form of the efficient market 
hypothesis to how I handle it in this project. You

0:02:54.240,0:03:00.960
can see the I build a data frame with these three 
columns EM form the short definition and how it is

0:03:00.960,0:03:07.920
addressed. So for example the first one which is 
the wick form it says that the prices reflect all

0:03:07.920,0:03:13.520
past price and volume information and I note that 
I'll look for momentum and reversals in abnormal

0:03:13.520,0:03:20.560
returns around the squeeze and the semi strong one 
is says that the prices should reflect all public

0:03:20.560,0:03:25.600
information and I explained that I'll use an event 
study of cumulative and normal returns around

0:03:25.600,0:03:31.840
public news like the 13D feelings around here the 
board use the squeeze and hearing and the last

0:03:31.840,0:03:39.120
one which is a strong form efficiency row two but 
there I note that it will be handled qualitatively

0:03:39.120,0:03:46.240
by discussing who gain and who lost this one. 
So let's move on to the second table which is I

0:03:46.240,0:03:51.680
create this table that defines my different event 
windows. This table has three columns which is

0:03:51.680,0:03:57.920
window type the range and purpose. For example, 
the estimation window is -250 to -30 trading days

0:03:57.920,0:04:04.720
before event for the estimation window and it's 
estimation and is purpose to estimate CAPM alpha

0:04:04.720,0:04:11.120
and beta. The short event window is negative 
-1 to + one days around the event which I use

0:04:11.120,0:04:16.720
to measure the immediate reaction and the medium 
window which is the second one. You can see here

0:04:16.720,0:04:24.400
it is a second but it's actually the third one. 
So which is uh it's around negative five to five

0:04:24.400,0:04:31.040
plus 5 days which lets me see short-term drift 
or overreaction. And the last one which is the

0:04:31.040,0:04:37.360
squeeze aftermath window which is the plus one 
to plus 10 trading days after squeeze speed. It

0:04:37.360,0:04:43.040
helps me to capture the reversal after the bubble 
pops. And the last one, I also build a table that

0:04:43.040,0:04:49.120
lists the specific events I'm studying, which is 
one row for initial RC venture state disclosure,

0:04:49.120,0:04:56.000
one for the state increases, and one for the bot 
announcement. And the fourth one is a short speed

0:04:56.000,0:05:02.960
and trading restriction. And the last one is a 
US house hearing on GME and the market structure.

0:05:02.960,0:05:10.480
So each row has an ID, a date, and a description. 
So the important thing about these tables is that

0:05:10.480,0:05:15.680
they encode my design in a very clear way. They 
don't calculate anything yet but they will show us

0:05:15.680,0:05:24.640
like which state matter which window I'll use and 
which model I'll apply and how much how each ems

0:05:24.640,0:05:31.360
analysis discipline instead of just random 
that keeps the analysis discipline instead of

0:05:31.360,0:05:37.280
random. So now let's move on to the implement 
stage. So in this implement stage I take the

0:05:37.280,0:05:42.320
plan from represent and actually turn it 
into a working pipeline in Python. I split

0:05:42.320,0:05:48.080
it into four different parts but I mainly talk 
about the first three part first. So the first

0:05:48.080,0:05:52.720
uh table is the data preparation, the second one 
is the model estimation and the third one is the

0:05:52.720,0:05:58.480
event window calculation. So let me show the first 
one which is this one. So the first table describe

0:05:58.480,0:06:04.000
the data preparation code I'm using. In a notebook 
I start from one combined data frame called data.

0:06:04.000,0:06:09.600
It already has the columns I need which is the 
date, the JME price, the market index price and

0:06:09.600,0:06:15.200
also the last one the risk free rate which is RF. 
You can see here this line and the step two which

0:06:15.200,0:06:22.960
is sort and clean dates matches the code where I 
convert the date column to date time and reset the

0:06:22.960,0:06:29.760
index. This makes sure the time series is in the 
correct order. So that later when I talk about t0

0:06:29.760,0:06:37.840
uh to 250 or t0 to 5 those really are 250 
days before or 5 days before the data. Step

0:06:37.840,0:06:43.920
three you can see here is the compute daily 
returns. In this code I use PCT change which

0:06:43.920,0:06:51.920
is this one on GME and market price to create 
GME and MKT R. So the output of this step is

0:06:51.920,0:06:57.360
two new columns showing the percentage change 
from one day to the next for GME and for the

0:06:57.360,0:07:05.760
market index too. And the fourth step is compute 
access returns. Here I create GME access and MKT

0:07:05.760,0:07:11.600
access by subtracting the risk-free rate which 
is RF from each daily return. This is important

0:07:11.600,0:07:17.520
because later in CAPM I work with returns 
above the risk-free rate not just raw returns.

0:07:18.080,0:07:24.320
So let's talk about the last step which is the 
drop missing values. So this thing corresponds

0:07:24.320,0:07:31.040
to the line where I remove rows with nans in the 
access returns columns. The first observation

0:07:31.040,0:07:38.720
after PCT change is always nan and there cannot 
be other gaps. So cleaning up this out give me

0:07:38.720,0:07:45.760
a tidy data set that is ready for regression and 
event window calculation. So from this table one

0:07:45.760,0:07:54.800
the output is a clean data table with GME RAT the 
MKT and most importantly the GME access and MKT

0:07:54.800,0:08:01.680
access. So dates are solid and NN are removed. 
This matters because CAPM and event studies work

0:08:01.680,0:08:08.160
on assess returns not just raw prices. A quick 
sanity check here is that the dates increase one

0:08:08.160,0:08:16.800
row at a time. You can see here and daily access 
returns look uh plausible not straight missing

0:08:16.800,0:08:22.880
values. So this is how I got the first table. So 
now let's move on to the table two. So the second

0:08:22.880,0:08:28.880
table summarize the capm estimation part of the 
code. This is where I estimate what normal look

0:08:28.880,0:08:35.520
like before the event. So you can see here the 
first step one which is identify the event date

0:08:35.520,0:08:42.960
matches the code where I locate the event date in 
data and get its index position which I call t0.

0:08:42.960,0:08:49.200
This index is my anchor point for defining all 
windows around the event. Set two is a defining

0:08:49.200,0:08:56.640
estimation window stage. It's where I chose a 
pre-events range such as t0us 250 to t0us 30.

0:08:56.640,0:09:03.920
In the code I convert those offsets into index 
number. This window is far enough away from the

0:09:03.920,0:09:11.920
event so that the event itself does not cont so 
that the event itself does not contaminate the

0:09:11.920,0:09:19.440
regression. Step three is a subset estimation 
data. It cor correspond to taking that slice of

0:09:19.440,0:09:27.120
the data frame and keeping only GME access and MT 
access dropping any remaining missing values. So

0:09:27.120,0:09:34.960
the output is an estimation sample that contains 
only clean access returns for GME and the market.

0:09:34.960,0:09:42.640
So step four is where I set up my regression. 
it. I use MKT access as a regressor and add a

0:09:42.640,0:09:50.480
constant term which is GME access is the dependent 
variable. Step five is the estimation of the CAPM.

0:09:50.480,0:09:57.040
The output gives me an intercept and a slope. The 
intercept is alpha and the slope is on MKTSS is

0:09:57.040,0:10:03.680
the beta. So these two numbers and describe how 
GME typically move relative to the market in the

0:10:03.680,0:10:10.400
estimation period. step six which is the last one 
here which is how to store the parameters. Uh it

0:10:10.400,0:10:15.360
means that I kept those alpha and beta values and 
use them later to calculate expected returns in

0:10:15.360,0:10:21.840
the event window. So the result of this whole 
block is a pair of capm parameters that define

0:10:21.840,0:10:29.120
normal behavior for GMBB before the event. So from 
table two the output is alpha and beta right from

0:10:29.120,0:10:35.920
the pre pre-event regression of GME access and 
MKT access with a constant. So these two numbers

0:10:35.920,0:10:42.320
define GME normal relationship with the market 
before the event. So beta should be a sensible

0:10:42.320,0:10:48.960
size for volatile stock and alpha should be small 
in daily terms. This gives the baseline needed to

0:10:48.960,0:10:55.520
predict what GM's return should have been absent 
the event. So now let's move on to the third

0:10:55.520,0:11:01.520
table. The third table explains how the code uses 
those CAPN parameters around the event to compute

0:11:01.520,0:11:06.880
abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns. 
So the first step which is choosing the event

0:11:06.880,0:11:14.320
window matches the part of the code where I define 
a range like t0 minus 5 to t0 + 5. This tells me

0:11:14.320,0:11:21.520
which days around the event that I want to study. 
Step two is extracting the event window data.

0:11:21.520,0:11:27.840
It is the slice of data that keeps only those rows 
and the columns I needed which is include date the

0:11:27.840,0:11:35.120
GME access and the MKT access. So the output here 
is a smaller data frame just for the event window.

0:11:35.120,0:11:41.440
Step three, I'm computing expected access return 
using the CAPM parameters from before. So for each

0:11:41.440,0:11:48.480
day in the event window, I applied this formula. 
You can see here this one. So in the data frame

0:11:48.480,0:11:57.200
this shows up as a new column called exp which is 
this one the first one uh which represent what GME

0:11:57.200,0:12:03.360
access return should have been if only normal 
market movement were were at work. So step four

0:12:03.360,0:12:08.960
which is computing abnormal returns which is AR is 
where I subtract the expected access return from

0:12:08.960,0:12:16.640
the actual one because you can see the formula 
here cuz you can see the formula here. This one

0:12:16.640,0:12:24.080
uh that gives me a new column AR that shows 
how much EM over or underperform CAPM on each

0:12:24.080,0:12:30.240
day around the event. Step five is computing 
cumulative abnormal returns because we are

0:12:30.240,0:12:37.200
comparing between abnormal returns and cumulative 
abnormal returns. Right? So in this step uh the

0:12:37.200,0:12:44.160
result is a C series that shows the total abnormal 
impact of the event as we move across the window.

0:12:44.160,0:12:51.200
So we can so let's move on to step six which is 
assemble output a table just means that after

0:12:51.200,0:13:00.080
these steps I have an event window table with 
date j access mkt access exp and c there's six

0:13:00.080,0:13:07.040
things there the key output of implement I use it 
uh in the validate stage to run the c signific uh

0:13:07.040,0:13:14.000
significance test and then in evolve to interpret 
what this abnormator says about market efficiency

0:13:14.000,0:13:21.920
and the GME episode overall. So from this table 
the output is the event window table with the

0:13:21.920,0:13:31.120
date GME SS MTSS exps AR and CR across the chosen 
window which is as for example is T 0 - 5 to T

0:13:31.120,0:13:40.320
0 + 5 sounds confusing but it's actually only 5 
days to + 5 days and that's it and AR shows the

0:13:40.320,0:13:48.960
daybyday uh deviation from CAPM and C stacks those 
uh deviation to show the total abnormal impact of

0:13:48.960,0:13:56.000
the event. So the quick read is check AR on 
the event day and watch how C builds through

0:13:56.000,0:14:03.840
the window. So taken all together. So taken all 
together this output finish the build phase which

0:14:03.840,0:14:09.280
is the data is prepared the normal return model 
is estimated and the abnormal returns are measured

0:14:09.280,0:14:15.440
around the event. So this is exactly what's needed 
for validation next which is testing whether C is

0:14:15.440,0:14:22.720
stat uh statistically different from zero and for 
the evolve discussion about what those abnormal

0:14:22.720,0:14:29.200
move mean for market efficiency behavior and risk. 
Now let's move on to the fourth table which is the

0:14:29.200,0:14:34.640
last one too. So after finding a real abnormal 
return around the event, the next question is

0:14:34.640,0:14:40.640
did trading activity jump at the same time because 
prices don't move like that by themselves, right?

0:14:40.640,0:14:45.600
So if attention and hearings matter, we should 
see a quick search in participation right around

0:14:45.600,0:14:53.120
the event. So I switch from returns to volume and 
look for a simple spike benefit pattern. So I use

0:14:53.120,0:14:59.360
a table called DF with date and volume. The code 
cleans the dates, sort everything in time order,

0:14:59.360,0:15:09.840
which is this part um this part or sort everything 
in this one and um finds the event date. If that

0:15:09.840,0:15:15.280
exact date isn't in the data, it uses the closest 
trading day. Then it split into the timeline into

0:15:15.280,0:15:20.640
three parts which is pre-event, the event and 
the postevent which is all three is here. You

0:15:20.640,0:15:29.200
can see here pre-event event and postevent and 
this one too. So for each part it calculates

0:15:29.200,0:15:35.280
the average and median daily volume. You can see 
here I slowly go through it. You can see premeian

0:15:35.280,0:15:41.600
uh event mean, post mean and the medium and 
the turnover. So if a flow column exists,

0:15:41.600,0:15:49.120
it also shows turnover for all three like the 
pre-event, the event and the postevent. So finally

0:15:49.120,0:15:54.800
it prints a three row table which is pre-event 
post and a smaller bar chart. So the change is

0:15:54.800,0:16:02.880
easy to see. So if float isn't available it's it 
just keeps uh so if float isn't available it just

0:16:02.880,0:16:12.720
skips a turnover and still works. So let me show 
you the whole thing and this is how I got my chart

0:16:12.720,0:16:17.920
and this is the table and this is the chart. So 
the table shows a clear jump in activity during

0:16:17.920,0:16:24.320
the event window. The average daily volume is 
about 1.95 million shares before the event and

0:16:24.320,0:16:30.560
jumps to about 10.07 million during the event 
around like five times higher and then drops

0:16:30.560,0:16:37.440
back to 1.7 97 million after. And the median 
volume moved the same way which means it's not

0:16:37.440,0:16:44.080
just one or two crazy days. The activities was 
broadly higher across the whole event window.

0:16:44.080,0:16:49.600
So if turnover is included it rises too 
means the flow change it hands faster

0:16:49.600,0:16:58.800
while the squeeze was happening. So you 
can see the whole everything is right here.

0:16:58.800,0:17:03.840
So now let's move on to the validate part. I 
tested the cumulative abnormal return which

0:17:03.840,0:17:11.040
is c around the event. So in the shop window you 
can see the first line here. The first line here

0:17:11.040,0:17:23.680
uh the short window -1 to + one the CR is about 
23.75%. And with t = to 3.42 and p = to 0212. So

0:17:23.680,0:17:34.720
I reject C equals to zero. I also ran a robustness 
window which is 2 to + 2. C is around like 29.10%

0:17:34.720,0:17:44.720
with t= to 0 3.05 5 and P equals to 0.0034. Both 
test says that the move is statistically real. So

0:17:44.720,0:17:51.840
I compare the price jump to public fundamentals. 
So at the P the stock traded near 483, right? You

0:17:51.840,0:17:59.040
can see here like this part this one. So while 
analyst targets at the time were roughly around

0:17:59.040,0:18:05.920
$10 to $40. So there wasn't new positive public 
news to justify the gap. So during the squeeze

0:18:05.920,0:18:12.320
the price decoupled from public information 
and the the third one which is the wid form

0:18:12.320,0:18:17.920
efficiency says that past information shouldn't 
predict returns. So around this episode social

0:18:17.920,0:18:24.720
media flow and sentiment line up with short run 
price move showing some predictability and create

0:18:24.720,0:18:31.440
a tension with weak form efficiency. Let's talk 
about the last one which is join hypothesis. So

0:18:31.440,0:18:36.720
if event study test EMH and the return model 
together, so a bit of model error is always

0:18:36.720,0:18:43.440
possible. But given the size of the CS, a 
small miss in this model is unlikely to as

0:18:43.440,0:18:50.480
a small miss in this model is unlikely to explain 
everything. So the effect looks genuine, not just

0:18:50.480,0:18:57.200
so the effect looks genuine, not just modeling 
quirk. So let's move on to the evolve part.

0:18:58.000,0:19:03.040
So in the evolve stage I stop focusing on the 
code and start asking myself what do this result

0:19:03.040,0:19:11.360
actually means. So in the first table which 
is this one. Uh the first row is implication

0:19:11.360,0:19:18.320
for active management. The idea here is that big 
mispricing like GME can happen but trading them

0:19:18.320,0:19:25.280
is very dangerous. So h funds with large leverage 
position will hit hard when the squeeze happened.

0:19:25.280,0:19:30.880
So for active managers the lesson is learned. 
So be careful with crowded shots use position

0:19:30.880,0:19:37.760
limits and stress test for short quiz and stress 
test for short squeeze instead of assuming this

0:19:37.760,0:19:45.280
stock is obviously overvalued. It will fall soon. 
The second row which is this one I'll show the uh

0:19:45.280,0:19:51.440
output too. So the second row is implication 
for passive investing. So for index investor

0:19:51.440,0:19:58.880
GE is just a tiny slice of the portfolio. Even 
with the even with when the stock exploded right

0:19:58.880,0:20:05.280
and then crashed the effect on broad index was 
very very small. The effect on a broad index was

0:20:05.280,0:20:10.640
very very small. That supports the idea that the 
low cost passive investing still makes sense for

0:20:10.640,0:20:16.000
most people because trying to time rare dim 
whim stocks events is hard and very risky.

0:20:16.000,0:20:20.960
Now let's move on to the third row which is the 
behavioral finance and limits to arbitrage. So

0:20:20.960,0:20:27.200
here I highlight that J was driven by behavior 
here like the hering the FO the lottery style

0:20:27.200,0:20:33.040
bets and Bman's hands culture on Reddit. So at 
the same time there were limits to arbitrage

0:20:33.040,0:20:39.440
which is very high short interest expensive 
borrow margin calls and trading restrictions.

0:20:39.440,0:20:45.200
These frictions made it hard for rational traders 
to quickly push the price back to fundamentals.

0:20:45.200,0:20:51.360
The fourth row which is the last row is market 
structure and policy because GME raises a question

0:20:51.360,0:20:57.360
about how brokers manage risk and explain trading 
halls. How transparent short interest and margin

0:20:57.360,0:21:02.800
rules should be and also how trading ads are 
designed. Message is that we may need a better

0:21:02.800,0:21:08.000
balance between easy access for return investors 
and protection that reduce confusion and extreme

0:21:08.000,0:21:17.280
risk takingaking. So let's move on to the second 
table. So the second table goes deeper into

0:21:17.280,0:21:23.280
rational investor profitability and leverage. So 
the first row here you can see that it's X and D

0:21:23.280,0:21:29.520
and X post profit. Looking back it's easy to say 
that I could b have bought uh like Tesla at that

0:21:29.520,0:21:36.240
price and so at that price. But at the time those 
trades were extremely risky and hard to time. But

0:21:36.240,0:21:42.320
at that time those trades were extremely risky and 
hard to time. So there was no simple safe rule a

0:21:42.320,0:21:48.880
rational investor could follow in real time. 
And row is a systematic profit opportunities.

0:21:48.880,0:21:55.600
It makes the same point which is to really break 
EMH you want a repeatable strategy in GME. Most

0:21:55.600,0:22:00.000
success stories depend on nearly perfect timing 
which is not something you can reliable repeat

0:22:00.000,0:22:07.520
on. The third one which is re and the third one 
which is the risk adjusted returns. Uh it reminds

0:22:07.520,0:22:13.840
us that even if some people made big gains, the 
downside risk was huge too because like squeeze

0:22:13.840,0:22:19.200
uh because like squeezes the margin calls and 
the chance of blowing up like some hedge funds

0:22:19.200,0:22:25.760
it the fourth one. Wait before that let me show 
you the output for it first which is I was saying

0:22:25.760,0:22:30.640
the whole time but I didn't show you at all 
because basically everything is right here.

0:22:30.640,0:22:36.160
So the fourth one which is the information 
advantage it knows that return traders didn't

0:22:36.160,0:22:43.280
have private information their age their edge 
their edge was mostly speed and coordination on

0:22:43.280,0:22:49.520
social media so hedge funds had better fundamental 
research but were exposed to crowd race so it's

0:22:49.520,0:22:55.680
more about different types of information so it's 
more about different types of information that

0:22:55.680,0:23:01.520
one side being smart and other so it's more about 
different types of information that one side being

0:23:01.520,0:23:08.400
the smart guy and the other one is being the dumb 
guy. Finally is the asset leverage which connects

0:23:08.400,0:23:14.560
to leverage and risk shifting. Highly leveraged 
funds shorting GME could end up taking even more

0:23:14.560,0:23:21.040
risk after losses. So effectively shifting 
risk onto leaders and prime brokers. So that

0:23:21.040,0:23:27.360
leverage helped turn a mispriced stock into 
a full-blown short squeeze event. So overall,

0:23:27.360,0:23:33.360
evolve shows that what the numbers means in real 
life, such as how active and passive investors

0:23:33.360,0:23:39.040
should think about stocks like GME, how behavior 
and friction matters, and how leverage and market

0:23:39.040,0:23:46.400
design can make this event much more extreme. So 
now let's move on to the reflection part on market

0:23:46.400,0:23:52.000
efficiency. J pushed me to a more balanced view. 
In the short run, the squeeze clearly did not

0:23:52.000,0:23:58.240
look efficient, right? Because prices exploded 
to levels far above any reasonable fundamental

0:23:58.240,0:24:03.680
estimate, returns show strong momentum and a 
brief crash and social media sentiment play a

0:24:03.680,0:24:10.400
huge role too. Over a longer horizon, the price 
moved back closer to the fundamental ranges and

0:24:10.400,0:24:16.400
there still wasn't a simple lowrisk trading rule 
that would have guaranteed profits ahead of time.

0:24:16.400,0:24:22.960
So I end up seeing ENH as a useful baseline 
that can break down in extreme stocks like uh

0:24:22.960,0:24:28.560
GME rather than something that's always right or 
always wrong. I actually also learned a lot about

0:24:28.560,0:24:36.720
the process of doing empirical finance. I had to 
fix basic facts like the wrong 0.04 04 price, view

0:24:36.720,0:24:43.120
a clean timeline, choose windows, estimate CAPM, 
compute AR and C and then actually test whether

0:24:43.120,0:24:50.080
C was statistically different from zero. Made me 
much more aware that good stories need data and a

0:24:50.080,0:24:56.160
proper design behind them. So in the end, I really 
want to say the driver method really helped me a

0:24:56.160,0:25:01.520
lot. Like the discover and define part made me 
clean up the facts and state the main question.

0:25:01.520,0:25:06.960
The represent part forced me to design the event 
study clearly. The implement and validate part

0:25:06.960,0:25:12.560
made me turn that design into numbers and check 
if they were robust. And the evolve part made

0:25:12.560,0:25:18.720
me stand back and ask these matters for active 
and passive investing for behavioral finance and

0:25:18.720,0:25:25.200
for how I think about EMH going forward. And 
that's all I have today. Thank you very much.

Hi, I'm Madison Nichols. This is my
0:07
session a assignment. So, starting with
0:09
the define and discover portion, the
0:11
goal of this assignment is to perform a
0:12
case study on the GameStop short squeeze
0:14
event of 2020 to 21 and and use that to
0:18
investigate market efficiency. So, the
0:21
first claim we have to explore before we
0:23
start with anything is that GameStop
0:24
traded at 4 cents in August 2020. This
0:27
is not true. So looking quickly at Yahoo
0:30
Finance, we can see that it's all above
0:32
$1. That statement isn't true. So for
0:35
the purposes of this assignment, we're
0:37
going to use the historical data because
0:39
we know that's what's accurate and true
0:41
to this event. So looking at the
0:44
timeline, in August 2020, GameStop is
0:47
near bankruptcy levels. In September
0:49
2020, Ryan Cohen acquires 13% stake. In
0:52
January 2021, the prices surged to $483.
0:57
And this is because of a Wall Street
1:00
gamblers or bettererss um kind of
1:03
hurting thing. And then February 2021
1:06
there are congressional hearings on
1:07
market manipulation. And then in the
1:09
present there are postevent price
1:10
stabilizations.
1:12
So short interest peaked at 140% a
1:14
float. Um retail trading volume
1:17
increased 10fold during the squeeze.
1:19
Trading restrictions implemented at the
1:20
peak by Robin Hood. Hedge fund Melvin
1:23
Capital sustained 53% loss requiring
1:26
bailout bailout or bailout sorry and
1:29
then analyst fundamental value estimates
1:32
$10 to $40 per share. So starting with
1:35
the background of the EMH the hypothesis
1:40
this says that stock prices reflect all
1:41
available information. So the weak form
1:43
is that prices reflect all past price
1:45
and volume information which means the
1:47
technical analysis or patterns won't
1:49
work. Semi form says that prices reflect
1:52
all publicly available information which
1:53
would mean that fundamental analysis
1:55
doesn't work. And then the strong form
1:57
is that prices reflect all information
1:59
including private information which
2:00
would then not lead to insider trading.
2:03
So moving on to the represent portion.
2:05
What we're trying to do is market
2:06
efficiency testing. So we're going to
2:08
test the semi-strong form of the EMH.
2:10
And what we're going to do is we're
2:12
going to look at the year leading up to
2:13
the event to determine their normal
2:15
behavior and then the short period
2:16
around that event. So then from that
2:19
period leading up to it, we're going to
2:20
kind of determine their expected return
2:23
and try to find their beta based off of
2:25
that and the normal relationship to the
2:28
market and then with that calculate the
2:30
expected return during the window and
2:32
then find the abnormal returns which we
2:34
do by doing actual minus expected return
2:37
and analyze that. So a couple more key
2:41
concepts information in corporation is
2:42
the speed and accuracy at which new
2:44
information reflects the assets price.
2:47
So some shortcomings of EMH is that it
2:50
assumes that humans are perfectly
2:52
rational economic agents and some site
2:54
behavioral biases as reasons to reject
2:56
it. So some of those can be
2:58
overconfidence. You think you know more
3:00
than you do. Anchoring so you're being
3:03
stuck on a piece of information like I
3:04
bought this at $200 and I don't want to
3:07
sell it until it's at least $200. So
3:09
hurting is just following the crowd. Um
3:12
kind of bandwagoning. So that's kind of
3:14
what the Wall Street bets driven price
3:16
surge was caused by loss aversion is
3:18
just that you don't want to lose money
3:20
and then mental accounting. So say I get
3:22
a $1,000 tax return. I don't I may not
3:25
treat that as real money because that's
3:28
not money that I planned to have. So
3:30
then it's kind of free reign and putting
3:32
into the market. There are also some
3:34
anomalies in the market. So momentum um
3:37
tendency for stocks that performed well
3:39
in the past to continue performing well
3:41
contradicts the weak form of the EMH
3:44
which basically says that if that is
3:46
true then the patterns shouldn't be able
3:48
to tell us anything. Value effect which
3:50
is that value stocks outperform growth
3:52
stocks over the long run. Similar thing
3:54
with size effect with small
3:56
capitalization versus large
3:57
capitalization companies. And then the
3:59
calendar anomalies. So in January
4:01
there's January effect which stocks have
4:03
unusually high returns. Um there's also
4:06
an asset substitution problem. So if a
4:09
company is in debt, equity holders don't
4:11
have anything to lose because the debt
4:13
holders are those who get paid first. So
4:15
equity holders now have an incentive to
4:17
substitute their safe assets with risky
4:20
assets. Um and then limits to arbitrage
4:22
are the reason that apparent
4:24
inefficiencies can persist in markets.
4:26
Um, so there are two kinds of investing
4:29
we define active and passive. So if you
4:32
do not believe in EMH, you are an active
4:35
investor. So you're going to look for
4:36
mispriced stocks and try to exploit
4:38
biases to beat the market. But if you do
4:41
not believe in it or if you do believe
4:44
in EMH, you're a passive investor. So
4:46
you're probably going to buy lowcost
4:47
index funds like the S&P 500 because
4:50
you're not going to think that you can
4:51
beat the market. So moving on to
4:54
implementation. Um there are some
4:56
there's some Python code to go over
4:58
this. So essentially starting off what
5:01
this will do is it's going to implement
5:04
all the historical data that is relevant
5:07
to our analysis. So we'll just see some
5:09
outputs that are available to confirm
5:11
with what we see on Yahoo Finance which
5:13
will come in the validate portion. So
5:15
that's what these are for.
5:17
And then what this block of code is
5:19
going to do, it's going to create a time
5:21
series for um
5:24
the GameStop's close price in relation
5:27
to key events. So what we see is that on
5:32
this graph, we see a big spike in the
5:35
close price during this short squeeze
5:37
peak and then immediately at its peak,
5:40
Robin Hood implements those
5:42
restrictions. So then we see it go down,
5:44
then it goes up again. Um, so we see
5:46
this like very volatile graph. It's
5:48
going up and down compared to previously
5:50
where it was a pretty flat line, pretty
5:52
low. And then we also see this with the
5:54
trading volume. There's a lot more
5:56
trading activity during that short
5:58
squeeze peak um which does go down after
6:01
those restrictions are implemented. So
6:03
that's just kind of the visualization of
6:05
these um
6:07
of this timeline in relation to what was
6:10
happening with the price. So we see
6:12
their near bankruptcy levels and then
6:14
suddenly there's a price surge based on
6:16
the Wall Street bets. Um and then we see
6:20
it go down after that as restrictions
6:21
are implemented and there are
6:23
congressional hearings. Um
6:27
and then from that what this code is
6:29
going to do it's going to calculate log
6:30
returns. What this is all for is to try
6:33
to extract a beta from the previous
6:36
behavior. So it's just a lot of
6:39
statistical work. Um and then you'll see
6:42
the output as the log returns. And then
6:44
what we're going to do is we're going to
6:45
estimate beta from that um through a
6:48
regression. So it'll have it kind of how
6:51
confident we can be in it. And based on
6:54
this, we do see a pretty decent level of
6:56
confidence um with the regression
6:59
results. And then we see
7:04
that it estimates the beta as being
7:06
about 1.1581
7:09
um against the spy. So what we're going
7:12
to do with that then is we're going to
7:14
calculate the abnormal and cumulative
7:15
abnormal returns. So this will use the
7:17
beta that we um extracted from the
7:21
regression to find what we would have
7:22
expected the returns to be during this
7:25
short squeeze event and we're going to
7:26
visualize that. So that's what we see
7:29
through this code and then putting that
7:31
into a graph. So we see that
7:35
previously it's pretty normal. It's
7:37
close to zero a lot of the time and then
7:40
when the short squeeze happens we see a
7:42
lot of movement and then a similar thing
7:45
with the cumulative returns um close to
7:48
zero and then suddenly it goes up. and
7:50
how we interpret this. Um so in a semi-
7:55
strong efficient market all public news
7:57
like the short interest because we know
7:59
from the context that
8:02
um there was short interest peaked at
8:04
140% a float that would assume that that
8:08
should be priced in instantly. So there
8:10
should be in this cumulative returns
8:12
chart one jump on the day of that news
8:15
but instead we see it continuously
8:17
climbing for days and we see it kind of
8:20
moving a lot which um violates the semi-
8:24
strong form of the EMH because that
8:26
should have been priced in instantly if
8:28
that were to be true.
8:30
So moving on to the validate portion.
8:33
Um,
8:34
what I chose to do for this is compare
8:37
the downloaded
8:39
data points from here into the um to the
8:43
Yahoo Finance. So, just to validate that
8:47
what we're doing is correct, we see that
8:51
in August 2020, it says that the minimum
8:53
low price for GME is 1.0. And then we
8:57
also see that right here in the Yahoo
8:58
Finance chart. And then for these we see
9:03
the adjusted close in January.
9:06
Um so for example on the second it's 1.5
9:11
something. Um which is consistent with
9:15
what we see on Yahoo Finance. So that's
9:17
how I did the validate portion. So that
9:19
way we know that the values I'm using in
9:21
the code and what it's importing are
9:23
accurate. So for the evolve portion
9:26
apply efficiency insights to investment
9:28
strategy. Since this um event kind of
9:32
contradicts to EMH, one of the better
9:36
investment strategies in my opinion is
9:39
the core satellite structure. So 80 to
9:42
90% of your stock is going to
9:44
acknowledge the EMH and that it's
9:46
correct and you can't beat the market.
9:47
So you would put that in lowrisk funds
9:50
like the S&P 500. But then that other 10
9:52
to 20%, you kind of acknowledge that the
9:55
EMH may not be correct. um which is kind
9:58
of what we see with this example and use
10:01
that 10 to 20% to explore the
10:03
inefficiencies in the market and try to
10:04
exploit them for better returns. So that
10:07
would be able to take advantage of
10:08
situations like this where the EMH
10:10
doesn't necessarily seem to be true but
10:13
also acknowledging that it can be and
10:15
keeping that risk kind of um measured.
10:19
So for the reflection part, in
10:22
conclusion, this event does not support
10:24
the EMH um based on the way that we see
10:27
the cumulative abnormal returns behaving
10:32
because it is so varying and not just
10:35
one jump. It's not priced in immediately
10:36
from the news. Um
10:39
we it doesn't support the EMH. So as a
10:42
reflection, I was not really familiar
10:45
with this hypothesis before and what it
10:47
meant. So being able to explore the
10:49
different types of the hypothesis and
10:52
also including some more statistical
10:54
knowledge with the um with finding the
10:57
beta was very helpful. Um but we do see
11:02
mostly overall with our goal of
11:04
performing a case study to investigate
11:06
market efficiency that the EMH does not
11:09
appear to be consistent with the semi-
11:11
strong form based on this event. Thank
11:13
you.",,0,1

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,440
Hello, I'm Brock and today we are going

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
to going over the

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,320
session 8 market efficiency

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
investigation. So today we're going to

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,119
be talking about the we're going to

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,279
investigate the market efficiency using

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,560
the GameStop short squeeze events of

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,960
2020 2021 as a case study and that's

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,560
when the stock actually went all the way

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
down to about 1.04. 04. We have to

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
verify the accuracy of the stated facts,

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
analyze price behavior relative to

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,879
efficient market hypothesis predictions,

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
and evaluate whether market anomalies

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
constitute evidence against market

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
efficiency or can be explained within

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,719
existing frameworks. So the critical

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
first step is we're going to verify the

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,640
statement GameStop traded at uh 0.04 in

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
August of 2020 against actual historical

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
data. If incorrect document the accurate

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,920
figures and determine appropriate

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,159
communication approach.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,479
So I first

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,760
I asked uh chatgd to create me a python

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,000
code using the kiss method while

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,520
defining each part of the code. So we

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,880
have the investigation which is what I

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
just said. We have the critical first

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,680
step and then we have the event line

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,280
which is August 2020. The GM GME near

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,920
bankruptcy levels. September 2020, the

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Ryan Gohan Chewy founder acquires 13%

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,439
stake of GameStop. January 2021, Reddit,

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,799
the Wall Street Bets driven the price

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,880
surge up to around $400 or around $500

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,720
actually. And then we got the February

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
2021 congressional hearings on the

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,119
market manipulation. And the present is

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,720
the postevent price stabiliz

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,640
stabilization that they've been going

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
for. And the key data points we're going

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,520
to be using are a short interest peaked

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,119
around 140 of float. The real deal

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
trading volume increased to 10fold

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
during squeeze. Trading restrictions

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
implemented that peak. The hedge fund

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
Melvin Capital sustained 53% loss

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,360
requiring a bailout and then analysis

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,479
fundamental value estimated $10 to $40

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,319
per share. So the required analysis is

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,360
to verify all stated historical price

53
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,720
data and document corrections. test

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
which form of the market efficiency,

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,480
weak, semi- strong or strong, was

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,080
violated and then um evaluate whether

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,400
rational investors could have profited

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
systematically. Compare efficient market

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
hypothesis predictions to observed

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
behavior and then assess behavioral

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
finance explanations for observed

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
anomalies

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
anomalies and then create a driver

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
analysis for each part of the code and

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,280
implement a useful graph show the stock

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,879
drop rapidly over 2020 to 2021. Then I

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,519
said make sure it's in simple and all

68
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,160
stage of the driver format

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
and some requirements is your analysis

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,040
must include market efficiency testing

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,080
classification of the weak semi- strong

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,800
and strong analysis of information into

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
prices of normal returns during the

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
event assessment of predictability

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,360
patterns behavioral finance analysis

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
identification of behavioral biases

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,280
and yep just all the ones that were in

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,760
down here. Here we go. All these.

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,519
So, it created me a code and I will pull

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,200
up that code right now.

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
All right. So, this is going to be our

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,200
code. And

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
so, for our discover and design. So,

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
what is the context of this? We're going

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
to be studying the GameStop short

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,000
squeeze. Want to connect to this market

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,640
efficiency. What's the given assumed

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
from your assignment? the timeline for

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
our financial objectives for this code

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,040
is all these and then the driver goal

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,560
for this video.

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,560
So, let me scroll down to here.

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
This

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,040
is our fact checked. So, there was 21

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
trading days in August of 2020. The

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,879
minimum adjusted close, which is

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,400
actually going to be 1.04 instead of

98
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,439
0.04.

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,400
So, they just had a $1 difference. So,

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,879
they probably um weren't accounting for

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,799
the $1. And then the max adjusted close

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,519
is 1.67.

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,720
So, this shows you that August 2020 was

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,560
definitely not a good year for GameStop.

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
And then the month in close was

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
obviously the highest at this. So, they

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,680
kind of bounced back a little bit, I

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,680
guess. So, did the GME ever hit 0.04 in

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,680
August of 2020? And no, that is not

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:36,479
true. And data does not support the 1.04

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:41,040
claim. price is around $1, $1 to $2. The

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,880
average daily return in 2020 was around

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
0.0070,

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,080
so 70%. And the standard deviation of

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,759
the daily returns was around 7.46%.

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
So now that we got that critical out of

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:05:01,360
the way, we're going to go back up here

118
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:04,400
to our R for driver. And this is an

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
analytical approach. So the variables

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,560
we're going to use are price t is the

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,080
adjusted closing price. Return is the

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,840
adjusted closing price minus this.

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
And then that's going to get the return

124
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
from the price. And then the volume is

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
the trading volume. How many people

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,320
traded on that certain day?

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
And

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,520
we are going to implement now. So here's

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,600
where you build the code and

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,680
um each function is going to explain

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,600
what it is. So we got to get the data.

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,320
We're going to get our data from the Y

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
finance.

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,600
It's going to put it into columns. And I

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,960
think this is our data down here.

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, this is all of our data.

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,039
So it's from 2020 to 2021. This is the

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
first 15 abnormal days. And this shows

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,880
all of the prices. So it looks like they

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,840
had a ter obviously a terrible

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,600
return and close and it builds back up

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,600
and then it falls slightly.

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,680
So this graph is actually going to show

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
us from 2021. This is the price US

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,479
dollars.

146
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:24,440
So, there's actually a big spike and

147
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,440
this spike is actually from the um

148
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,600
I think it was r/wall street bets and

149
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
they they decided that they were all

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
going to put money into it one day and

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,080
completely

152
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,880
blow the stock out of the water and it

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,880
went up to around $480.

154
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,080
So this is

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,080
where I

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
have the here. I actually made a driver.

157
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
We can just go to this. This is probably

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:09,360
easier to get with. So we got the

159
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,960
represent. So, one of our goals was to

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
show

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,759
if it was a weak form, semi- strong form

162
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,599
or a strong form. So, the EFH is that it

163
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
states the stock prices reflect all

164
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,560
available information. So, a weak form

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
of the EMH is going to be prices reflect

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,039
past market data with no technical

167
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
advantage. Semi-rong form is prices

168
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,360
reflect all public information, no news

169
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
advantage. and the strong form as prices

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
reflect all public and private

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
information.

172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
So, we're going to compare the GME

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,319
actual price data to the EMH

174
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
expectations.

175
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
And if the EMH held, GME prices would

176
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
have reflected the fundamentals and

177
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,080
adjusted smoothly to the new

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,560
information. But instead, the GME

179
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,840
experienced rapid irrational price

180
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,840
increases from the Wall Street bets.

181
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
So the relationships of this so high

182
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,680
high short interest is increased the

183
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,199
potential for a squeeze. They had social

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
media coordination which is the

185
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,639
amplified demand of the wall streets

186
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,360
trading restrictions which was the Robin

187
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
Hood that changed the liquidity patterns

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
and then we got the investor sentiment

189
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
was an overpowered fundamentals

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
temporarily.

191
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
So for the visual representation the

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
timeline summary August of 2020 the

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,840
price ranged from a dollar to $2 but it

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,800
hit um $4 to $5. that was at the end of

195
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,800
it and then

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,479
we already talked about this stuff.

197
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
So the price for the implement we got

198
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,680
the price verification

199
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,720
it was around4 that was at the very end

200
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,320
of it. So it was actually around $1 to

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,120
$2

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,800
and the price surge the rise from 483 in

203
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,760
January was disconnected from the

204
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,000
fundamentals. The trading behavior was

205
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
retail volume increased 10 times as

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,160
short interest exceeded 140 and the

207
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,040
major brokers limited the trades on it.

208
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,040
And then um

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
the project the code tested whether the

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,440
GME violated the EMH by comparing real

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,120
price data with the theoretical

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
predictions.

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,800
And the analysis evolved to include both

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,640
behavioral finance protective and market

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,519
structure explanations, the short

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,160
squeezes and liquidity constraints. And

217
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,160
then um

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,600
the final refinements was it recognizes

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,600
that the

220
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,640
sorry

221
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,200
reflect here sorry the so the key

222
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
insights is that market prices can now

223
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,640
um move irrationally in the short term

224
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,200
due to the emotion hype herd of behavior

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,880
as for the Wall Street bets is they all

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,160
kind of herded and flocked toward

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,399
towards the one stock to see how high

228
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,800
they could uh move it. And that shows

229
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,640
that the market prices

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,200
aren't always going to be stable and

231
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,440
they can sometimes be irrational. And

232
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
the EMA holds better over the long term,

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,399
but it fails to explain the short-term

234
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,839
bubbles like the GME going all the way

235
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,920
up to $480.

236
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,959
And you always want to get the verified

237
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,519
data is essential because 0.04 04 4

238
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,839
cents for a share is actually they would

239
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,839
have gone 100 they would have 100% gone

240
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,839
bankrupt.

241
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,680
So for

242
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
the Jimmyi

243
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,000
case illustrates how information

244
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,680
psychology and trading mechanics can

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
interact to create a short-term

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,360
efficiencies that later self-correct

247
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,279
over time. And this framework can be

248
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,519
applied to other market anomalies such

249
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,480
as the AMC one or the Bed Bath and

250
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:09,120
Beyond or even like cryptocurrency like

251
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,279
the meme coins or any of those using the

252
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,079
CAPM.

253
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,079
And then uh this strengthened the data

254
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,040
checking the analysis of certain

255
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,760
information and the communication skills

256
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,760
of individuals and these are all

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,920
essential for uh finance professionals

258
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,920
in the end. So, thank you so much

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Samantha Paguia and I'll be
recording my market efficiency
um analysis.
So,
let's go to there.
So, first I started in Google Gemini
with the prompt I am a finance student
in finance class using the KISS
principle and driver framework to
investigate the following market
efficiency and the prompt is GME short
squeeze analysis. So first they wanted
us to find out if the
statement here was accurate or not.
GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020
against actual historical data. Um and
if incorrect document the accurate
figures and determine appropriate
communication approach for correcting
the professor. So this is incorrect that
we found um
because you will see that in a little
bit. Um but so we wanted this prompt to
be structured um guide sequential analyt
analytical work starting with the um
mandated define and discover stage and
explicitly include the critical
factchecking step that identified the
initial error. Um so this is saying the
short squeeze event with late 2020 to
January 2021 to test the efficient
market hypothesis the EMH which will
come up later versus the behavioral
finance framework critical fact check
and correction um and then it states the
initial premises and then the verified
baseline is that GME traded in the range
of approximately 1.04 to 1.67 67 per
share during August 2020 just adjusted
for the 2022 split. Um and then the
revised analysis premise was that all
subsequent analysis must use $1.04 to
1.67 range as the pre-event baseline for
calculating returns and assessing market
value. And then here are the questions
to answer. Um define the official event
window from November 1st, 2020 to March
20 31st, 2021.
What were the DME price, volume, short
interest levels at the start and peak of
the event using the corrected baseline?
Um given key information and the
catalyst given in the problem data
requirements. Um
yes. And then R represent here is the
analytical plan and the data that they
gave us. So most of this here
so I won't go through all of that too
thoroughly.
Um, but there's important things here
that say like to test for significant
autocorrelation
um and daily returns. So, kind of what I
did was just add different prompts under
um each of these data points here to
correlate to the required analysis.
Yeah. So, I won't go through that too
much. Um, and then here's the
implementation step. Um what I did was
acquire the data. So download and
include the GME price, calculate returns
to compute the daily log return for GME
and the market index. Um calculate
abnormal returns. Implement the AR and
CAR um calculations and plot results
because that was in
where is it the requirements down here.
So yes um so what I did was integrate a
lot of this bottom half sporadically
in here um specifically in
implementation and then when it prints
out like my findings and everything in
the ENR so the evaluate and represent
and report stage.
So yeah um pattern review visually
confirmed that the car and volume
analysis aligns chronologically with the
narrative of the short squeeze event um
based on the air and car predictability
test. So this is for the EMH
clarification under evaluate behavioral
framework is to evaluate the extent to
which the price movements can be
explained by hurting social media
influence and limits to uh arbitrage. So
collateral requirements, execution
restrictions. I just wanted to
parenthesize this to make it a little
more clear for the open AI system. Um
theoretical implications discuss whether
GME represents a market failure or an
extreme realization of existing market
frictions. Compare explanatory power of
EMH um versus
the behavioral finance approach. And
then finally summarize the finding
concisely present the evidence for each
EMH form. Um policy discussion discuss
the implications for active versus
passive management and potential market
efficiency policy changes. Um the final
conclusion should state the ultimate
assessment did a systematic um risk
adjusted profit opportunity success for
a rational investor X anti before the
event or was it only a profitable gamble
expost after the event. Um, and then I
wanted to make sure this was compatible
through Python in Google Collab. So, at
first it gave me um this, which was a
good place to start, but then I had to
reprompt it. Um, here it shows the key
findings.
Um, and then here full Python code to
calculate plot statistically test um the
car. So, this originally didn't have the
car data in it and um some of the plots
weren't as efficient as I'd like them to
be for this specific problem. So, I
wanted it to kind of rewrite it. Then,
it gave me this output, but it gave me
like multiple outputs. So, I didn't
really like that. So, I wanted to adjust
the code
to become Oh, and then here's just the
visualization it will give later, but
we'll go over that in a minute.
um
sorry and the final conclusion here but
I wanted to simplify the code into one
so I had to reiterate it again um I
wanted to keep it very simple too and
then I wanted to make sure that um all
of the requirements from the original
statement were met so I made it recheck
that
and then I
um here you can see where it came out
too.
Um, so it's just kind of the chart and
then this one just gave me the float
number which is great but it's um not
exactly what I wanted. So I wanted to
add my analysis printed at the end of
the statement.
So then gave me this um well it didn't
give me a code at first but it gave me
like a Excel sheet. So then I said I
wanted to add to my code specifically
that was already made and then this was
the final code that it gave me and then
now we'll go over this a little bit. So
first we had to import all the libraries
um pandas, numpies, mapplot lib,
statistic models um for stats and so
those all go into our final output. Um
and then first data simulation um this
is where we're cleaning all the data and
acquiring it as well. 40-day estimation,
60-day event. Um and then the market S&P
500 and GME returns for comparison. Um
getting the data frame for the market
return.
Um using the lock function for um dates
and estimated days and the GME return
and then finding the event period GME
returns high voltity and um squeeze
spike. So that's directly measuring the
squeeze
um for the event to scale.
Yes. And then defining indexing for
clarity. This is just making sure that
um the following steps aren't confused
for um indexing specifically. And then
abnormal returns ar and c calculations
um are the r and i steps of this driver
framework specifically model to estimate
the capm um parameters using alpha and
beta during the estimation period. Um
that was a requirement between this was
to specifically use um alpha and beta.
So had to include that as well. And then
wanted to calculate expected returns,
abnormal returns and then cumulative
abnormal returns um for AR was the
abnormal returns and then Q cumulative
abnormal returns are C and then I wanted
the statistical testing V and E stage
initial results um semi- strong form for
EMH test car significance here using
that tat value and the P value to show
significance Um yes and standard error
as well.
Um using the length function for find
the um how long the events were
weak form EMH test um autocorrelation
again um the p value is going to be very
important here to test for significance
dynamic column indexing specifically
used. And then fourth was a VNR stage.
So, um, that's our visualization.
Um, it's going to be a line plot here.
We'll go over that in a little bit. Um,
yes, measuring
um the C log returns um with the dates
specifically to look at the squeeze.
Um, yes. And then we finally wanted to
integrate the analysis reporting. So,
this is the ENR stages section prints
the final results um and interpretation.
And something I liked that Google Collab
added where the visual little icons here
just to like keep it a little more
organized. Um maybe I would take it out
though if it was through a professional
analysis, but since this is just going
to like a professor, I feel like it
would be okay. Um yeah, specifically
including the interchangeable P value, T
stat, final car, B stat, P or um sorry,
LV, LB p value
um and then a few other calculations. So
let's go over the findings first and
then see how that correlates to our
cumulative abnormal returns for GME
analysis.
So here it says market efficiency
testing results. Um what's important
here is the conclusion statement. So P
is less than 0.05 leading to a rejection
of the semi- strong form EMH systemic
risk adjusted abnormal um profits were
possible and then the weak form EMH test
the conclusion was that P is about zero
leading to a rejection of the weak form
EMH returns exhibited significant serial
correlation/momentum
theoretical evaluation and
interpretation. The analysis shows
violation of both weak form
predictability and semi- strong form
abnormal profit EMH. So the EMA
classification is the EMH event
represents a clear market failure under
the EMH. The price movements were driven
not by the fundamental value um Ryan
Con's influence but by mechanical short
squeeze amplified by social
coordination.
And then behavioral framework. This
event is best explained by a
hurting/confirmation bias, meaning that
coordinated retail buying social media
drove prices far beyond rational um
valuation. And we see this a lot um in
real time to with examples not from
class like um things that kind of just
populate without us having any
indication of why they do or why the
media takes a certain liking to it. even
though it goes against um rationale if
that makes sense. And then limits to
arbitrage. The price spike was sustained
because institutional short sellers were
constrained by hard margin collateral
constant lack of available shares to
short preventing rational investors from
correcting the mispricing. So the final
con conclusion is that the GME short
squeeze was an expost profitable gamble,
not an X anti- risk adjusted
opportunity. Therefore making the
original statement from the prompt
not true. GameStop um traded at 0.04 in
August 2020.
Um active versus passive management.
While the event provided massive returns
for active traders, the high voltality
and non-fundamental risk make it an
anomaly, not a repeatable strategy for
rational active management. Again, that
this was kind of something that couldn't
be easily predicted. And then policy
implications. The event underscores a
need for regulatory review of short
selling transparency and clearing house
margin requirements to mitigate systemic
risk posted by extreme behavioral
cascades.
And then, oh, where did my graph go?
Let's look at that real quick.
Um,
oh, it did not save.
Um, let me repaste this.
Okay. So the graph that's shown here
final CR you can see the high spike jump
from January to February.
um and the car log returns this
calculation is presented to within um
the code here. So start of event period
as you can see after about
a month it spiked far upward for final C
being 4.10 which further um just
identifies our final conclusion and
report that this is an anomaly. So,
thank you for listening for um to my
market efficiency
um analysis here um and to see if it was
actually efficient for GME.
Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"I. Introduction: The GME Anomaly and Factual Verification
Hello We are presenting an event study and analysis of the GameStop (GME) short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021. Our primary objective is to evaluate the event against the core principles of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).
First, we must verify the historical facts provided in the assignment. The claim that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 is incorrect. Actual historical data shows that in August 2020, GME was trading around the $21 price level.   
Our analysis concludes that the GME short squeeze represents a major, temporary violation of market efficiency. Prior to the event, GME was a fundamentally challenged, brick-and-mortar retailer with weak financials, including negative revenue growth and a high valuation multiple relative to its earnings. The subsequent market surge, therefore, confirms a failure of informational efficiency concerning intrinsic value.   
II. The Structural Fuel and Behavioral Catalyst
This extraordinary price dislocation required two specific conditions: an extreme structural vulnerability and a powerful, coordinated behavioral shock.
The vulnerability was the institutional short position against GME. Short interest peaked at an astonishing 141% of the public float in January 2021. Short interest exceeding 100% is possible when the same shares are repeatedly lent out by successive purchasers. This technical concentration created a highly combustible environment where a price rise would force mandatory buy-backs, or a short squeeze.   
The catalyst was the coordinated collective buying by retail investors, primarily organized on social media platforms like Reddit. This rapid communication facilitated herding behavior and social informedness , instantly amplifying demand. Driven by cognitive biases—including the fear of missing out (FOMO) and a collective ""diamond hands"" strategy (avoiding regret by holding onto positions) —this shock drove the price from approximately $17 to an extreme pre-split peak of over $500 per share. This approximately 30-fold increase, absent any corresponding fundamental improvement, is a textbook market anomaly.   
III. Testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis
We assessed the event against the three forms of the EMH:
1.	Weak Form Efficiency: This form suggests that historical prices cannot predict future returns. The GME event challenges this. The predictable momentum and volatility clustering, driven by the technical short-squeeze mechanism, demonstrate clear, non-random price behavior in the short term, allowing temporary exploitation by momentum traders.   
2.	Semi-Strong Form Efficiency (Violated): This form states that all public information should be accurately reflected in the price. The GME price trajectory, inflated to levels fundamentally incompatible with the company's bleak long-term business outlook, confirms a significant violation. The market prioritized the temporary technical signal (the short squeeze potential) over the established fundamental signal (deteriorating sales).   
3.	Strong Form Efficiency: This requires prices to reflect even insider information. The event reinforces the practical rejection of this form, as large, sophisticated institutional investors who possessed critical information about the size and risk of their own short positions were unable to anticipate or defend against the retail shock.   
IV. Failure of Rationality: The Limits to Arbitrage
The most critical insight from GME is the validation of the Limits to Arbitrage (LTA) hypothesis. Arbitrageurs—the short-selling hedge funds—were constrained by liquidity risk and implementation costs, preventing them from correcting the mispricing.   
The rising price triggered devastating, mandatory margin calls. Highly leveraged firms like Melvin Capital, facing potential liquidation, sustained a 49% loss in the first months of 2021, requiring a $3 billion institutional bailout. This confirms that the organized noise trader risk was non-diversifiable and simply overwhelmed the capacity of rational capital to intervene.   
This situation was compounded by a microstructure failure. At the peak of volatility, app-based brokerages like Robinhood restricted buying because they lacked the internal liquidity to meet the sudden, massive collateral deposit requirements demanded by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). This regulatory constraint, implemented for the firms' own solvency, created an artificial downward pressure on the stock price, confirming that structural constraints can override market efficiency.   
V. Conclusion and Policy Implications
While the GME event yielded massive ex-post profits (actual realized returns) for early participants, the extreme volatility means it is difficult to argue that it offered systematic, low-risk ex-ante (forecastable) profitability. Active trading in this speculative environment is a risky bet, not a systematic strategy.   
The episode did not kill the EMH, but it proved that market efficiency is conditional, validating the LTA framework. This led to critical regulatory scrutiny focused on :   
1.	Short Selling Transparency: Addressing the extreme leverage seen in the 141% short interest.   
2.	Market Structure: Reviewing clearinghouse margin rules to prevent future brokerage liquidity crises and mandated trading restrictions.   
3.	Digital Engagement: Scrutinizing the use of gamification features on trading platforms and the role of social media influencers to protect retail investors from excessive risk.   
The GME short squeeze stands as a powerful case study demonstrating how technology and collective human psychology can temporarily dominate market fundamentals, forcing a re-evaluation of how markets function in the 21st century.

",FALSE,1,"Our task was to find the um financial data for GameStop and the S&P 500 and verify it. And um one of the points was to find if it was accurate that GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. We found that this was incorrect because um the u minimum closing price was $14 and the maximum is $135 an average of 117. So there's no way it could have been 4 cents. We can verify this because or we found this by simply um writing some simple code and it pulled from the GameStop data and the S&P 500 data frames and as well is used a start date of 2020 August 1st and end date of 2021 um March 31st just to verify these um that we have like the time period right which it did and so it is impossible this was traded at 4 cents. And then to just to show more of where we got this information from, we um built out a table just to see all the data points it pulled out. So these are the dates and this was the closing of GameStop, the high of GameStop, the low, open, and such. And so um these are basically just numbers of what they were typically traded at.

And so yeah, that's how we represented it. And it's um the GameStop return and the S&P 500 returns over here on these same dates. um comparing the two and

okay and we implemented this data by using a OS model. This model just kind of tests like its significance and um how good the data is making sure that what we're using is like the data we're using is um trustworthy. So looking at this we can pull from um the end. Okay. So alpha which um alpha interprets like um it's basically a test saying how your portfol port portfolio did. It runs it through a few tests and it gives you a number of how well it performed performed with the um with the um stock market. And so zero would be like hypothetically perfect. And so this one has a 00.94 which is really good. And then it has a beta of 1.7072. That is how much it fluctuates in the market. Um meaning like how much it can react. So um like considering a perfect market is a one and something that doesn't move with the market or moves like negatively with the market would be like a zero. So this is a 1.702 1.7072. So this moves um like 1.7 it fluctuates 1.7 times the um the average market. So that's not crazy at all.

Further we get to validate and uh we can validate these numbers basically with the alpha and the beta we found. So we know that these numbers aren't ridiculous. And also we are finding the abnormal returns and the [ __ ] accumulated abnormal returns. So that's what it's finding here. So the average abnormal return was a 2989 and um observed 14 times and that's also not a crazy number at all. So meaning um like anything that was significantly out of the blue like according to the market that's what this is trying to find. And then it's looking for the t statistic and the p value. The um

the p value is also just looking for abnormal abnormalities and anything or sorry it's p value testing its significance also and um so this would mean that that return is significantly significant at 5% level this is at 003 which is good. Um so that means they have a 90 96.5 97 yeah 96.5% confidence in their um in their information and then the

so yeah. Okay.

Um the abnormal returns are um like it's just a simple formula and oh sorry wait real quick. These are just um verifying like our findings. So you can see what we're looking for is randomness and these are all very random. So this is good for to validate our information and to get further back into um abnormal return. It's your actual return minus your expected return. And so that's how you can find that. And then your cumulative is just finding all of those and then um like adding it.

Okay. And then evolve. We

just to evolve the code. It I mean it was really long and I wanted more verification. So I added these charts just to visually see the randomness. It's easier than just looking at a bunch of numbers. And so that's how we evolved that. And then also um I had it kind of define some of the um terms that we were looking for. So weak form deficiency is an existence of significant returns during the event window suggested a strong reflection of weak form market and then semi strong is semi and then strong efficacy and so on. Um and this the GameStop information that we pulled towards points towards significant. So that is good for us. And then these are just laying out more terms like hurting behavior would be seeing everyone seeing a lot of people invest in something so you jump onto it. That's what that would be. Social media influence. These are just all ways someone could be uh inclined to invest in something. And so these are all things we're looking for.

Okay. And then lastly, we did our um reflect stage and we came with the summary. So, was GameStop trade at 4 cents? No. The price was $14 and maximum 135. So, there's no way. Um, was the prompt accurate? Um, yes, because the event the admiral returns. So it's confirmed this was correct because we tested the significance with the emerald returns and then some key findings um the CAPM style um yielded an alpha of um 0.09 09 or sorry yeah 0.094 094 and a beta of 1.7072. I already went over this. Um, and the returns, sorry, the abnormal returns went over that accumulating

substantial performance related to the market and model expectations, meaning um it did better than people expected. And then we test the statistical significance. Um, the market efficacy went over if it was weak or strong. and we validated that it was a strong form of efficacy. And then some biases we went over such as the um like hurting mentality or social media influence and so on. So um I believe that's all I need to cover. Yep. I'll say that's it. All right.

",FALSE,1,"Hey, my name is Diana and this is my session 8 driver analysis. So my main question for this project is did GameStop price behavior during 2020 to 2021 short squeeze follow the efficient market hypothesis or did the market behave inefficient? So to analyze this, I looked at price reactions, abnormal returns, um volume and behavioral patterns.

So the prompt claimed that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. And I verified the historical data myself and this was incorrect. Um GME traded and $2 in August of 2020. Um, so correcting this was important before starting the analysis. So here I just showed how I verified that on Yahoo Finance. Um, I chose the correct time period, historical prices, monthly, and then you can see the closing price here is $167 um on August 1. That's the I decided to use for the analysis.

Um here is the event timeline I used. So in 2020 um uh GME was distressed and then December of 2020 Ryan Cohen increased his stake. And then Jan 2021, Reddit refueled short squeeze um pushing price near $483. And then in February of 2021, there's the congressional hearings. So this helped me compare the timing of price reactions to the AMH predictions.

These key facts shaped uh the squeeze here. So first is um 140% short interest. Um then we have massive retail trading volume. We have broker buying restrictions. Hedge fund losses around 50%. um and analysts valuing the stock around $10 to $40 per share. And I got these from these websites. I have the sources listed here. Um and this helps to with the evaluation of like whether the prices reflected real information.

So in the represent stage, I mapped out my steps. So that involved verifying the price data, um collecting the GME and SPY data, um marking event dates, calculating returns and abnormal returns, um and analyzing graphs and results using EMH and behavioral finance.

So here im EMH predicts that prices should react quickly to information, abnormal returns should disappear fast and prices should stay close to fundamental value. And I plan to compare these to how Jimmy actually uh behaved.

And as a part of represent I kind of walked through my Python workflow. So downloading data, calculating daily abnormal returns, um marking event dates, plotting price, etc. So I have this all listed here and here is the AI prompt that I put into chatbt to get my Python for the financial analysis which outlines what I have listed here.

So now let's go ahead and do the code analysis.

So at a high level um this code is basically so first it downloads GME and spy data from Y finance. Um then it calculates daily returns for both um and computes abnormal returns as GME return minus market return. Um and then it defines the key event dates from the timeline and then generates three different graphs. the price chart, the abnormal uh returns chart, and then the volume chart. And then it'll also output uh summary statistics comparing the event window to the non-event window. And this is the output here that we can walk through.

So first is the summary statistics. Um these show how unusual GME was. So the event window normal return averaged here it says 14.4% compared to only 2% normally. Um and some days saw abnormal returns over here is 137% which is extremely rare. Um and then volume jumped around um 59 million to 338 million. So almost six times higher which is pretty significant. Excuse me. So these numbers show that GME's movements were far outside of normal market behavior based on what we know.

So next is uh the GME price graph. Uh it's kind of covered by this text here, but this graph shows the price spike pretty clearly. Um the price shoots up dramatically in late January, so right before Feb 2021 here and then collapses shortly after. There is no no new information strong enough to justify this move. So this suggests strong behavioral influence rather than efficient pricing.

Then here we have the abnormal returns graph. Um and in an efficient market abnormal returns should fade quickly. And here abnormal returns stay extremely high across um several days which is a sign of momentum trading and hurting behavior. So this is inconsistent with the semi strong EMH.

And then finally we have the volume graph. Uh the trading volume explodes during the squeeze period. um volume spikes like this often signal attention hype or like social mediadriven behavior rather than um fundamental value changes. So this kind of it supports the behavioral explanation.

Um so here in the validate stage I checked whether my results were reliable. So the robustness of findings um and the abnormal returns and volume spikes were large enough to be economically meaningful. Um so these weren't random one day jumps. They persisted across several days. Um no major public information explains the spike which suggests behavioral factors. Um, and the event window looks very different from the normal period, suggesting the idea that this was really a a real anomaly. So together, these checks confirm that my findings are strong and trustworthy.

So overall, this showed me that markets are equally efficient. Um where when there's hype or social media tension um prices can move away from the fundamentals. Um and then here in future analysis uh I'll watch for signals like big um abnormal returns volume surges um and online attention trends. And for investing, passive strategies work in stable periods but in unusual situations like GME, but behavioral factors matter more here. So overall, the conclusion is that GME showed that markets are mostly efficient but can break down under extreme behavioral pressures.

And on everything. My biggest surprise was to see how extreme the volume spike was. Um, as far as the hardest part, it was definitely fixing the code, the data uh process properly. I haven't had issues with the code not running in the past. So, I had to do a little bit of like um trial and error to um figure out what code works best. There was an issue with the adjust adjusted close column that I had to fix. And then as far as the easiest part, it was definitely um what was easier than expected was interpreting the graphs once they displayed uh because the patterns were pretty clear. And next time I'd give more time to the interpretation stage of the outputs since it ended up being like the most important and timeconsuming part.

So to conclude my analysis, um semi- strong efficiency was violated because prices did not respond rationally to information and weak form efficiency was partly violated due to momentum like patterns. Um and then for price behavior um it was driven by hype and overconfidence, FOMO, um hurting um and rational traders couldn't correct the price because of high risk and trading restrictions. And before the event, there was no predictable profit opportunity. and after the fact some traders profited but not in the way that indicates efficiency.

In the end um the GME squeeze shows that markets are generally efficient during normal periods but can temporarily break when behavioral forces and trading frictions combine. So, this case helped me understand both EMH and behavioral finance and how they work together in uh real markets.

All right. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hey guys, it's um Deeb and today I will be doing my session 8 market efficiency investigation. Okay. Um so today um I will start off with define and discover. So the goal is to investigate whether the GameStop um short squeeze violated market efficiency under the efficient market hypothesis. So the claim that we're given is that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. Um after doing some research I found out that the um it started off trading for a dollar at the beginning of August and then at the end of August it ended off trading for $1.40. So it was false and it wasn't a um trading for 4 cents. So the problem statement is um to um see if GME store short squeeze exposed efficiencies in the world in the market or can it be explained with EMH and behavioral frameworks. So the sources that I will be using is Yahoo Finance, SEC filings, Bloomberg and FIRA um short interest reports. Um the key metrics that I am also given is the short interest rate is 140% a float. retail trading volume is um increased by 10 um times the fold. Melbourne capital is um negative 53% loss and um analyst value range is 10 to 40% a share. Okay. So I'm going to represent all this information. So I know that EMH suggest prices reflects all available information in three forms which is weak, semi-strong and strong. Weak is historical data. Um semi- strong is public information and strong is private information and um behavioral finance and psychological and social biases which everyone knows that's true. Um unknown to unknown information and stuff that we need to analyze is did GME prices deviate from fundamentals in violation of EMH? um were abnormal returns statistically significant and were um profits predictable xante and approach we're going to be using is we're going to collect daily GME prices and volume data from 2020 to 2021. Um the window that we're going to look at is August 2020 to March 2021. We're going to estimate the expected returns using the CAPM market model and we're going to compute abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns. Um we're going to identify behavioral signals which is hurting over contracts and social trading. So I'm going to implement um Gemini to for Gemini to make me a python code to pull GME data from Yahoo Finance um using Y Finance. Um, we're going to calculate daily returns, apply CAPM to find expected returns, compute abnormal returns, which is the actual minus expected, and then we're going to plot the um, GameStop price versus the S&P 500 price. We're going to identify abnormal spikes in January 2021 and summarize the evidence of inefficiency. So, I already have the um code ready. Um so I told um Gemini for it to write me a Python code using Jupiter notebook to analyze market efficiency during GameStop short squeeze which was during this time frame and use the efficient market hypothesis. And this is everything that it's going to import. It's going to use daily prices from Yahoo Finance between these dates. It's going to calculate daily returns using the um return on investment formula um using the rate free numbers and all that. And then it's going to um identify major events such as the Ryan Cohen stake in September 2020, the Reddit surge in January 2021 and so on. It's going to improve whether the abnormal returns represent violations of weak semi-strong or strong form efficiency. And then it gave me some information. However, it didn't give me the code. So I just told it um just give me the Python code. And then it gave me the Python code. And then this is what it gave me. However, when I took it to um collab, it gave me an error which I pasted the error and then it fixed it for me. Okay, so um I ran the code. This is it importing pandas, numpy, yahoo finance, um math plot, which is where it can plot ma math and then this is um GameStop and the dates. Okay, so and this is the output that it gave me. Okay, and now I'm going to analyze this. So the regression output shows that GameStop's daily returns were largely uncorrelated with the broader market. The R squar of 0.08 which is right here um means less than 1% of GameStop's movements were explained by the S&P 500 changes. the beta of negative um 1.58 which is right here um suggests that GameStop moved opposite direction on than the market average and it's consistent with short squeeze behavior not normal fundamentals the alpha of 2.5% which is um 2.5% which is right here um per day represents extremely high abnormal returns that cannot be explained by standard risk factors. This clearly violates the semi-strong form of market efficiency since public information did not rationally reflect the price. Okay. Um now I I I can validate this um because of the findings that I found. Abnormal returns in January 2021 were extremely high and it's not explained by fundamentals. The short squeeze event um inconsistent was inconsistent with semi-strong efficiency um and the weak form may still hold um since patterns were not repeated. Um probability is um systematic arbitrage um was impossible due to trading habits and liquidity limits and it supports um limits to arbitrage and um conclusion is that if event shows temporary inefficiency not the total EMH failure. I can evolve on this by extending the study to um AMC and um BBBY for cross event efficiency testing. I can integrate the um Reddit situation to um an analyze for quantify hurting. I can use um event study regression to test C significance. I can refine the model using semi-strong efficiency um extensions. And um something that I learned is that market efficiency can break temporally under social media um driven hurting behavioral biases such as overconfidence FOMO anchoring um dominance short-term pricing. Um EMH remains largely intact when considering information costs and trading fictions. Um the one takeaway is that GameStop wasn't um proof that markets are irrational. It showed that investors are also human. And my final thought is that effic efficiency does not equal stability. Um and the mark the market corrected provided providing its self-healing nature.

",FALSE,1,"Hello. Um, my name is Tarth and in this project I'm going to be using the driver framework on session 8, assignment six, market efficiency investigation. I'm just going to go over the overview real quick. Um, our goal is to investigate market efficiency using GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 2021 as a case study, verify the accuracy of the state facts, analyze price behavior related to the EMH prediction, and evaluate market anomalies. Um, constitute evidence against market efficiency or can it be explained with existing frameworks? The first critical step is to verify if GameStop traded at uh 4 cents in August 2020 against actual historical data. If incorrect, document accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for existing or for correcting their professor. Here's the timeline. August 20 GME near bankruptcy levels and then Chevy founder acquires a 13% stake. Reddit, Wall Street Bets, retail traders driven price surge to 483, congressional hearing on market manipulation, postevent price stabilation, which is something that happen uh happens a lot when we see like IPOs or high volatile trading um situations where price stabilizes after a while. Key points, short interest peaked at 140% of float. Retail trading volume increased 10fold during the squeeze. Trading restriction implanted on peak Robin Hood hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 40 uh 53% loss during loss requiring bailout. Analyst fundamental value estimates $10 to $40 per share. Um so we're going to be required to verify all state historical price data and document corrections. Test whe which form of the market efficiency weak semi- strong was volatile violated. Um evaluate whether rational investors would have profited systematically. Compare effective market hypothesis reductions uh predictions to observe behavior. assess behavior finance expectations for absorbed anomalies. Um, we're going to be using the driver framework for this. So, I'm going to get started with uh the define and discover and the define discover stage. My first step, what I'm actually going to be testing is the core question I'm going to be focused on. Did the GameStop short squeeze represent a breakdown of weak form, semi- strong or strong form market efficiency or can it be explained once we have behavioral bias and time limited arbitrage? The assignment also asked me to do this one critical step first to see if it if GameStop was being traded at 4 cents in August 2020, which already from looking at GameStop's history, I don't think that's true. But we'll get in that to deeper like deeper into that uh later. Um we're also going to be performing a market efficiency test around a short squeeze evaluating abnormal returns, behavioral biases and market anomalies and limits to arbitrage and rational investor profitability. Um I briefly reviewed the three forms of market uh efficient market hypothesis. Weak form is prices already reflect all price past price and volume data. Semi-rong prices reflect all publicly available information and then strong form prices reflect all public and privately um private information. I also reviewed the basic story of GameStop. extremely high short interest, high uh huge retail participation from Reddit, Wall Street Bets, massive volatility, trading halts, and broker restrictions. Just give me a clear picture on what efficiency and inefficiency might look like in the event before actually touching any code and moving into using AI to help us understand this.

Um in the represent stage of the driver framework, I chose a broad question and turned it into a solid concrete simplified analytical plan um as finance uh professional should do. So GameStop is the stock I'm analyzing. S&P 500 is going to be used as a simple proxy for the overall market. I downloaded data from August 1st, 2020 and to January 31st, 2022 and represented what I needed um GMC GME price and GME volume and then GME daily returns and then also looked at SMC price returns and um for market efficiency testing I used a event study structure picked a event date around the height of the squeeze. I also defined a event window of 10 trading days and before and then 10 training days after to see the price before and after. Um it was affected by the volatility. Instead of a complex regression model, I used a very simple expected return model. expected uh GME return should roughly equal the S&P 500 return each day in the event window.

And then this simplified event study lets me see how unusual GME returns relative to the market. So this is going to help us see if this is actually normal, which obviously it's not. And then it's gonna show us how and why. Um, for the implement stage, I'm going to be using Python to help me and analyze the situation. Python's also going to be used um to make sure all the questions are answered. So, I was having a bit of trouble with my Python code in Gemini. So, this time I'm going to be using chat. Um, this is the code, my final piece of code that I used. Um, it had some errors. I fixed the errors and then I already ran it ran it sorry in collab. I'll run it again to get

right. There we go. It ran again perfectly.

And then let's go over the code briefly here. It downloads the data that we need for our charts, our analysis for S&P and GameStop. Here it's going to verify the claim of 2020 if price was actually trading at 4 cents or if it was higher or lower. And then here is a simple event study I talked about 10 days before, 10 days after. And it's going to compare to the S&P 500 return to see a normal what a normal asset would do over a long term. And then I have a visualization of both a price chart volume abnormal returns

and then I have simple stats code right here. Okay, let's get through this then.

Here's the volume. Uh we see

so the price of GameStop on August 3rd, 2020

we see is roughly around a dollar volume. Here's S&P 500 price. The return seems normalish

for both. Here is the price check which was a key factor. Price is not trading at 4. Is trading at $14 and going up to 167 in the month of August 2020.

And here's the event window. We're going to see

So, GME price, here's a chart of the price increasing dramatically to over $80 in a period of what is that, a month or like two or threeish weeks. And then here's the volume. This is where we can see an interesting picture right here. An insane amount of volume is being traded almost eightfold or tfold stated in the GitHub. And we can see that's not normal. So this is there's a lot of retail action going on, a lot of activity going on. And then here's an abnormal return. And according to the simple event we did, we can see that there's a few days where there's extreme returns for GameStop compared to normal. And then abnormal return summary. The mean AR was 0.2543. AR on event day zero was 1.3. Mean AR from + one to + 10 was negative0.1119. A simple t stat test for abnormal returns mean abnormal return was 0.1332. Standard deviation was 0.760. Our sample size was 21 and t stat was 1.29.

Um, so for this I feel like I'm complete with the implement stage. I used in AI and chat and Gemini all combination to get code to help me analyze this. Analyzing just the charts alone tells me this is unnormal. This is not usual. Um, so I think I'm going to move on to the validated stage to use the information from the implement stage to further understand the situation. In the valid stage, I evaluated whether my results genuinely suggest market inefficiency and how strong the evidence is. From the stats I observed, the normal return on day zero um AR events, you can uh was very large and positive. Mean abnormal return before day zero was and after day zero it was mean post if they are positive.

Let's see.

This is getting into the statistical statistical

stuff. This code. Oh, yes. Right here. Mean, pre mean post. Okay. Yeah, this is getting the stats stuff. I really don't want to get into this stat that stuff before understand other um things.

Let's see if I can find

Yeah. So validating efficiency isn't just about statistics. So I considered um economic significance into this. The car is a very large in this window. So expost some investors earned huge profits others lost a lot of money like the hedge fund. At times some traders faced extreme volatility shorts risk and the huge poss uh possibility of crash limited to arbitrage and market structure. Um short interest exceeded 100% of the float. Short sellers face margin calls and the risk of the classic squeeze. Brokers like Robin Hood imposed trading restrictions limiting buys volatility halts. So when the abnormal returns and the car patterns are are to reconcile with a clean frictionless version of the semi- strong EMH once we include behavioral behavior uh biases and strong limits to our arbitrage they become more understandable in the ball state. I generally I generalize these findings to a broader market investment strategy and theory. My conclusion is that the markets are mostly efficient but not perfectly efficient. In normal conditions, prices for long liquid stacks trend to reflect public information quickly which supports semi- strong EMH as a baseline. But in special circumstances like GameStop where there's a short extreme short interest, the social media coordination intense retail speculation, behavioral finance and structural frictions can dominate, creating large and temporary deviations from fundamental value, which we can see clearly from these charts alone. From behavioral pe uh perspective, GameStop hurting people piling stocks because everyone else on Reddit was doing it. This is like something we can see on a lot of social medias today when someone is doing something like crypto or bitcoin. Other people try hurting in causing inflation or inflated assets which technically should not be doing but they are because people are hurting in. It can also cause overconfidence strong belief that they can beat hedge funds and the broader market. anchoring and limiting attention focuses on slogans to the moon or short squeeze narratives instead of the fundamentals from investment strategy. This supports a barbell style philosophy um using passive index fund for core of portfolio acknowledging that markets are generally efficient and hard to beat after cost.

All right, for that's I think we're good for the ball stage. I'm going to move into the reflect stage. In the final reflect stage, I look back at what I learned and how the driver process helped me. The biggest shift in my thinking is the EMH is still a useful framework, but it's clearly incomplete on its own. The GameStop squeeze produced large significant abnormal returns that contradicted a naive version of semi strong um EMH. At the same time, once I layered it into a behavioral bias and the limits to arbitrage, which event look less like a free money and more like a high-risk type of gamble driven into anomaly.

Um, I would say the driver framework was very helpful for this. It helped me discover and analyze the situation. It helped me uh identify which questions need to be answered. The represent stage helped me choose a simple but uh coherent study design and a comparison. The implement stage helped me use Python to get real data and compute returns. The valid stage helped um me compare a statistical significance from economic standpoint and comparing it to financial standpoint which cannot always match. But we saw um the returns down here which yeah evolve connected this one event to a broader idea and the overall uh behavioral finance of retail traders compared to hedge funds and other types of investing. Overall this project showed me how to move from textbook theory to real data and back using code. And I think that completes this assignment. Thank you for watching.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, this is my Session Eight assignment where I am going to do a GME market efficiency analysis, investigating the market efficiency using GameStop as my company. Our objective is to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, EMH, and assess behavioral finance explanations for this unprecedented event. My entire analysis is structured in sequence using the DRIVER framework: define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect. Let's get into the first step, define and discover. The Define stage establishes our core research question: was the GME squeeze a violation of market efficiency, and if so, which form? We focus on the three forms of EMH: weak, which considers past prices; semi-strong, which considers public information; and strong, which considers all information. The critical first step is data verification because the statement given may not be accurate. My first critical step was to verify the claim that GME traded at $0.04 in August 2020. This step has to be completed before any implementation. Using Yahoo Finance, I isolated all August 2020 prices. The lowest split-adjusted price is $1.04, not $0.04. The lowest split-adjusted closing price in August 2020 was $1.04. My documented communication approach for this situation is that the critical first step revealed a significant error: the lowest August 2020 price was $1.04, not $0.04. I will proceed with the accurate split-adjusted data for the analysis. This establishes the correct baseline for investigation. In the Represent step, I planned the analytical approach to connect the data to theory. First, data acquisition: I pulled data for GME and the S&P 500 benchmark using the yfinance library. Next, visualization: creating a two-panel chart, one for price and one for volume to illustrate retail activity. Then, analytical testing: visually testing the weak form by looking for momentum and the semi-strong form by checking the price against public analyst estimates of $10 to $40. Lastly, the behavioral framework integrates theories like herding, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage to explain any observed inefficiency. In the Implement stage, I executed the plan using the Python script. In Define and Represent, I explained what my analysis would be and how I would conduct it. In Implement, I pulled the script, ran the code, and obtained the two graphs and outputs. The code uses adjusted close prices to correctly account for the 2022 4-for-1 stock split. For data collection, I pulled GME and the S&P 500 from August 2020 to mid-2022. For verification, I ran the check. The script confirms the lowest August 2020 price was approximately $1.04. The incorrect prompt value is now documented. For visualization, the top chart shows price on a log scale, illustrating extreme volatility. The peak pre-split price of $483 illustrates the massive disconnect from the $10 to $40 fundamental value. The bottom chart shows volume. The volume spike in January 2021 increased tenfold, indicating a market structure event rather than a fundamental shift.
For daily returns analysis, the script calculates daily returns. Multiple days had returns exceeding 100%, highly abnormal and not explained by normal market risk factors, a strong initial indicator of inefficiency.

In the Validate step, I confirmed the reliability of results. Adjusted close data ensured statistical accuracy for historical comparison. Price decoupling from the S&P 500 benchmark and the volume spike confirms robustness. Daily returns analysis shows abnormal returns outside the bounds of normal risk-adjusted market movements, signaling a violation of the semi-strong form. In the Evolve step, I enhanced the analysis and addressed advanced requirements. A full event study could use CAPM to calculate alpha and beta during a normal estimation period, then compute abnormal returns (AR) and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) during the squeeze, quantifying the inefficiency. Limits to arbitrage can be tested by acquiring the cost to borrow GME shares. High borrow costs explain why hedge funds could not correct the price, allowing the inefficiency to persist. Systematic profit was not possible; profits depended on timing and luck, reinforcing passive management principles. In the Reflect stage, I synthesized findings. Weak form EMH was violated: the phenomenon was driven by momentum and herding behavior, which uses past price data to predict future gains. Semi-strong form was severely violated: all public information, including high short interest, analyst estimates of $10–$40, and Reddit coordination, was not reflected in the price. Strong form was violated: since public information was mispriced, the market was inefficient relative to all information. Behavioral finance explains the event: it was fueled by psychological biases like FOMO, herding, and the belief that retail investors could achieve guaranteed profit. The anomaly persisted not because the market was fundamentally irrational, but because limits to arbitrage and the risks and costs for rational investors, including hedge funds, to correct mispricing were too high. This illustrates that EMH is a model, and in real markets, structural flaws allow behavioral anomalies to temporarily dominate. In conclusion, the GME case was a short-term violation of the semi-strong EMH, driven by behavioral finance principles and allowed to persist due to market microstructure issues. That completes my Session Eight analysis. Thank you.

Hello everyone, my name is Javier Patino
0:02
uh and this is my session 8 driver
0:04
analysis on GameStop markets efficiency.
0:07
Um so starting off with my define and
0:09
discover um the question is whether
0:11
GME's uh squeeze violated market
0:14
efficiency uh or reflects behavioral
0:16
forces in trading frictions. First I
0:19
verified
0:21
um the data the statement that GME
0:24
traded at uh 4 cents at 0.04 04 dollar
0:29
in August 2020. Um is incorrect. Uh
0:32
split split adjusted it traded roughly
0:36
uh for $1 and uh one cent uh to $1.79.
0:45
The key events were uh Ryan Cohen's uh
0:48
stake in September and December, um the
0:51
January 2021 spike to 483,
0:54
and the January 28 uh trading uh trading
0:57
restrictions in the February hearings.
1:01
So, uh down to my represent section. Um
1:06
my test is, uh an event study using the
1:10
the CAPM, uh normal returns. So a * r or
1:16
like a r time equals r time minus um
1:21
significance plus beta r uh m time. Um
1:26
my analyze the windows around the coen
1:28
filings uh the January uh squeeze
1:31
cluster
1:33
uh the January squeeze cluster and the
1:36
restriction day. I'll evaluate semi-
1:38
strong EMH uh and over and overlay
1:41
behavioral mechanisms like hurting and
1:44
overconfidence uh plus limits to uh uh
1:48
to a bridge uh from halts uh and borrow
1:53
constraints.
1:54
So we go down to implement. We're going
1:56
to skip verify. We'll go down to
1:58
implement first. Um
2:02
my implement. Sorry, I thought I had
2:04
implement down there for some reason.
2:05
But here's my regression right here.
2:08
Show you down here. So after putting in
2:09
some code,
2:11
I was able to obtain a regression. I
2:16
could just open it up.
2:20
There we go. So I got my regression
2:23
right here. Um
2:26
so here's my regression on the pre-event
2:29
window. um the output of uh significance
2:33
or the constant uh the constant
2:36
coefficient is 0 uh 0170
2:40
uh and then our beta is 1.580
2:44
and our p value is 0.042
2:48
uh and then the R squar uh is 0.049.
2:53
So GME moved about 1.6 six times the
2:56
market but most of its return variation
2:59
was stock specific. Next, I computed
3:02
abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal
3:05
uh abnormal returns. Uh in the AR in the
3:08
AR chart
3:10
down here,
3:12
this AR chart um as you can see
3:17
uh there's spikes.
3:19
I'm trying to
3:24
hold on. There we go. So, as you can see
3:26
right here, there are
3:35
so as you can see in the AR chart, um
3:38
the abnormal returns chart, you can see
3:40
a large uh spikes around January 20,
3:44
2021.
3:46
uh and
3:48
and the car rises above uh plus three on
3:53
early February. We go and look at
3:55
February.
3:57
There we go. That's why I thought it was
3:58
weird. It was zoomed in.
4:01
So, as you can see, um car rises plus
4:04
three in early February. So, this
4:06
confirms substantial abnormal
4:07
performance. Um and then the price Oh,
4:11
it's not supposed to do that.
4:15
I just switched my There we go. And the
4:18
price chart
4:20
the price chart um shows the same story.
4:23
Um so flat for months and then a sharp
4:27
rise into late January. Um and to verify
4:32
um the test on if we go down to my
4:35
verify
4:38
do our test on uh our uh AR.
4:44
Sorry. Our AR Oh my gosh, this thing our
4:48
AR so abnormal returns
4:51
uh versus zero. So the p value is uh
4:54
less than 0.05.
4:57
So abnormal returns are statistically
4:59
different from zero. All right. And then
5:00
we have our window security not security
5:02
sensitivity. So our window sensitivity a
5:04
car within uh plus or minus 5 days uh
5:09
and plus and minus 10 days around
5:11
January 28th 2021 remains strongly
5:14
positive. So the interference uh isn't
5:17
window perfect. Um and I even uh
5:20
compared it right here. You can see that
5:22
it's not window perfect.
5:24
Not window perfect window dependent. Um
5:27
so it's not window dependent. Um and
5:29
then
5:31
I also uh the rolling the C uh so
5:36
rolling the the cumulative uh abnormal
5:38
returns uh 10day rolling uh
5:43
C um rises steeply through late January
5:47
confirming multi-day uh drift and then
5:50
down to my evolve section.
5:54
Um down to my evolve section I started
5:56
with price
5:58
uh slash abnormal return only then uh
6:04
added uh short interest
6:16
so okay so sorry um so I started with
6:18
the the uh abnormal return only uh with
6:23
price uh then I added short interest
6:26
volume contacts uh and multiple windows.
6:29
So I kept CAPM for clarity and course uh
6:33
alignment. Uh then
6:35
so like the refined approach better
6:38
isolates a semi- strong uh efficiency
6:40
question. As you can see here
6:44
I'm trying to
6:47
as you can see here um same with my
6:49
validation section my mouse stopped
6:52
working. Okay. So to reflect
6:56
um my conclusion is that semi- strong
6:59
EMH was stressed. Um prices didn't fully
7:03
uh incorporate
7:05
uh prices didn't really fully
7:06
incorporate um
7:10
didn't fully incorporate uh public
7:12
information immediately. Instead, you
7:15
know, behavioral hurting and market
7:17
friction sustained the move. Um,
7:21
Exante uh systemic profits
7:24
uh were tough after halts uh collateral
7:27
and borrowed costs.
7:29
Um the professional the professional
7:32
takeaway is a hybrid
7:36
I'm sorry not a hybrid uh what's the
7:39
word? That's my cat.
7:42
Um is a hybrid philosophy. So the
7:45
passive core exposure plus selective
7:48
active strategies is clearly defined u
7:51
behaviorally driven events. Um so yeah,
7:55
thanks for
7:57
uh watching my video.
7:59

",FALSE,1,"Hello everyone, my name is Jake Patterson, and this presentation covers my Market Efficiency Investigation of the GameStop short squeeze using the DRIVER analytical framework. In this project, I investigate whether the behavior of GME during 2020–2021 aligned with the predictions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or whether the extreme movements we saw represent true inefficiencies that EMH cannot explain. I also verify the accuracy of historical claims, perform a simplified CAPM-based event study, evaluate abnormal returns, and connect the empirical results to behavioral finance and market microstructure. My analysis follows the DRIVER framework strictly in order, beginning with Define and Discover before any modeling or coding takes place.

To begin the Define stage, the core objective of this project is to test market efficiency using the GME short squeeze as a real-world case study. The research question is whether GME's price behavior was consistent with weak, semi-strong, or strong form EMH, and whether any rational investor could have systematically profited from the patterns that occurred. This includes verifying important factual claims—such as the statement that GME traded at four cents in August 2020, which turns out to be inaccurate—and making sure the analysis is grounded in correct data. The Define stage also sets the expectation that the analysis must integrate both EMH theory and behavioral finance explanations for anomalies.

During the Discover stage, I collected and verified all required data before conducting any analysis. After pulling GME historical prices from reliable financial data sources, I found that GME did not trade at $0.04 in August 2020; instead, it traded between about $1.20 and $1.70 during that month, with August 31 closing around $1.67. Correcting this claim is important because inaccurate inputs would invalidate any conclusions about efficiency. I then constructed the official GME event timeline: the distressed pricing in August, the Ryan Cohen stake announcement in September, the rapid retail-driven expansion in January, the peak near $483, and the trading restrictions issued by Robinhood. Establishing this timeline is essential for conducting an event study.

In the Represent stage, I mapped the problem to the three forms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Weak form efficiency tests whether past prices contain any predictable patterns. Semi-strong efficiency looks at whether markets react quickly and correctly to public information. Strong form efficiency evaluates whether any group—whether hedge funds or early Reddit traders—can consistently earn abnormal returns. From these hypotheses, I created the event-study structure. The estimation window covers roughly 250 to 30 trading days before the first major event, and the event windows center around the Cohen announcement, the board appointment, the peak squeeze, and the Robinhood trading limitations. These windows define how abnormal returns will be measured.

In the Implementation stage, I wrote a simplified Python script to conduct the event study. Because online compilers often cannot download market data, I used manually embedded price lists for GME and SPY. The code computes daily log returns, estimates CAPM alpha and beta using a simple covariance and variance formula, and then calculates abnormal returns by subtracting the predicted return from the actual return. The code also computes cumulative abnormal returns over the event windows. This produces quantitative evidence that can be evaluated in the next stage.

From the code output, the CAPM beta is extremely high, reflecting GME's enormous volatility and weak connection to the broader market. The abnormal returns are highly irregular, with massive positive abnormal returns during the squeeze—some exceeding 100% per day—and large negative abnormal returns following the trading restrictions. The cumulative abnormal return curves spike violently and collapse just as quickly. These patterns are inconsistent with semi-strong market efficiency, because prices do not reflect public information smoothly or rationally.

In the Validate stage, I interpret these abnormal return patterns in the context of EMH. Weak form efficiency fails because momentum and reversal patterns during the squeeze were predictable over short horizons. Semi-strong efficiency fails because public news produced exaggerated and chaotic price reactions rather than smooth adjustments. Strong form efficiency appears violated because certain early investors—such as early Reddit traders or funds that repositioned early—earned enormous abnormal returns that others could not replicate. However, it is important to emphasize that these profits were not systematically achievable due to extreme volatility, margin constraints, and broker-imposed trading restrictions.

To evolve the analysis, I integrate behavioral finance explanations. Herding behavior on Reddit massively amplified coordinated buying. Overconfidence, confirmation bias, and fear of missing out caused many traders to ignore fundamentals. The disposition effect created irrational holding behavior even during extreme volatility. On the institutional side, short interest exceeding the float created a structural squeeze, clearinghouse collateral demands forced trading restrictions, and liquidity constraints distorted price discovery. These behavioral and structural factors explain why inefficiencies persisted despite being theoretically exploitable.

In the Reflect stage, I tie the results back to theory. The GME event does not prove that EMH is useless; rather, it shows that markets can become temporarily inefficient under intense psychological and structural pressure. For long-term investors, markets remain efficient enough that passive strategies still dominate. For short-term traders, behavioral forces and market frictions can overpower rational pricing for extended periods. The DRIVER framework helped structure the analysis from initial fact-checking all the way to theoretical interpretation, preventing the common mistake of jumping to coding before defining the problem.

Overall, this project demonstrates how EMH and behavioral finance complement each other. EMH explains why systematic arbitrage was nearly impossible, while behavioral finance explains why the mispricing happened in the first place. The combination of both frameworks provides a complete picture of the GME short squeeze and highlights the importance of data verification, disciplined research design, and thoughtful interpretation of market anomalies. 

The first part of the code computes log returns from raw price data, which converts differences in stock prices into standardized daily return values. The next section calculates CAPM alpha and beta using a simple covariance-to-variance ratio, which estimates how much of GME's return is explained by market movements. The script then calculates abnormal returns by subtracting the CAPM-predicted return from the actual GME return on each day. After that, the cumulative abnormal returns loop adds these abnormal returns sequentially to measure the total event impact over the window. Finally, the script prints out the AR and CAR results, which are used in the Validate stage to determine whether the market behaved efficiently around major event dates.",,0,1

Hello. So, today we are going to be working on  our session 8 video assignment. And so, just  
0:08
to walk through, we're going to be um doing the  driver framework for the GameStop um price spike  
0:16
basically, which uh we'll get into what it is, but  first I want to map out what we're going to do.  
0:21
So we'll start with define and discover, then make  our way to represent, then implement. Then we'll  
0:28
go ahead and validate those with Yahoo Finance,  then evolve. We're going to take a look at some,  
0:34
um, crypto, and then we're going to reflect on  what we learned and how we learned it all. So,  
0:41
um, just a little background, we can go up to  our session 8. Um so we're looking at the market  
0:51
efficiency uh of the time period which is the 2020  20 uh 2021 GameStop thing. It started late 2020  
1:01
then moved into 2021. So um we had to work with  this first step first which we have right here and  
1:09
uh the claim was that GameStop traded at  4 cents in August 2020 which is false.  
1:15
Um, we know that it traded around three to four  dollarsish, 380. Um, we have it up right here and,  
1:25
uh, you go to here and this is Yahoo Finance.  But, um, oops. This is the spike that we're  
1:34
going to talk about later, but I screenshotted it  for now, just right here. Um, so then we're going  
1:40
to look at the timeline of how this all So, GME is  GameStop. So, GameStop goes near bankruptcy. Um,  
1:47
and then the Chewy founder took 13% stake  of it in September. And then January 2021,  
1:54
uh, so this platform called Reddit, which is where  users can, uh, collaborate and bounce ideas and  
2:01
stuff like that to share socials. um they all came  together and basically said let's all rise or uh  
2:11
like start buying GameStock and uh surge the price  to 483 which uh if we go to here um where is it at  
2:24
we can see that it got up to 483. So, uh, yeah.  So, that is true. And then February, they had the  
2:36
congressional hearings because people manipulated  the market, which just means they all bought it  
2:43
at the same time and drove it up. And then, uh,  present is just the price stabilization now, which  
2:49
we'll get to, but that's just it's around $20  right now. So the key data points for us are that  
2:56
it peaked at 140% flow. Uh the re retail trading  volume increased 10fold during the squeeze. Um  
3:04
trading restrictions happened at the peak. So like  Robin Hood didn't allow people to buy it at the  
3:11
peak. And then uh a hedge fund person uh Melvin  Capital sustained 53% loss requiring the bailout.  
3:21
and uh analysts uh fundamental value estimated $10  to $40 per share and it got all the way up to 400.  
3:32
So now we're going to go to our represent stage  which we have these questions that were asked  
3:37
about in here um we had to verify these or the  critical analysis. So we have to verify the stuff.  
3:46
We have to test for market efficiency and then  evaluate if rational in investors could be profit  
3:54
and then compare efficient market hypothesis  to what we saw and then uh just look at the  
4:00
behavioral finance that could have explained how  this all happened. So I mapped it out right here  
4:06
as my represent. So first we need to verify the  data and define important terms. Then we need to  
4:12
think like a rational investor. We can't just sit  here and look at numbers all day. We actually have  
4:17
to think about it. And then we need to compare  it to what we know about the GameStop incident,  
4:23
which is where we'll find it in the data part  right there. Excuse me. And so these are just some  
4:31
things to look for. Efficient market hypothesis,  uh the efficiency testing, behavioral biases,  
4:38
stuff like that. So first let's start off with  number one. We're into our uh implement stage  
4:43
now which we're going to do it. So verify all  stated historical price data and documents are  
4:50
correct. So we went ahead and we have some sources  here. Um we'll just pull one up for example.
5:00
Um basically it's just talking about the  whole incident and it comes around to say  
5:06
that they're right. So now we're going to  get into our which we have uh we did verify  
5:13
this with Yahoo Finance which I showed you  earlier. So, um, we're going to test which  
5:19
form of market efficiency was violated. And  we would say that the inefficiency that was,  
5:29
um, the market was inefficient was that Robin  Hood was so convenient that people could buy  
5:38
any stock anytime, ETF, memecoin, anything like  that. They could buy it right away. And also,  
5:46
um, when Robin Hood put a cap on how much they  could buy or if they could even buy it at all,  
5:52
that raises ethical and legal questions when  Robin Hood like froze all of the stuff. So,  
5:58
that's a inefficiency that we saw. And uh, then we  need to evaluate whether rational investors could  
6:07
profit through this. And so another article that  I read just said that a lot of people uh rational  
6:15
buyers, they bought into the hype. They they  bought it and they sold it at its peak of like  
6:21
$400ish dollars, like right before it peaked and  then they sold it right before it crashed and uh  
6:28
they made a lot of money. So yes, they could, but  at the same time, not many people would want to  
6:34
get into like a risky stock, especially knowing  that GameStop was about to go bankrupt. So, uh,  
6:41
a lot of people lost money by buying the hype late  like at $400 and then not selling it in time and  
6:47
having it crash all the way to like $50. That's  $350 they lost per share, which adds up quick.  
6:54
And then we want to compare the efficient market  hypothesis to what we saw. So basically the market  
7:01
hypothesis says that current asset prices reflect  all available information. Um so basically um in  
7:10
this case uh GameStop we see that it's not true at  all. it didn't follow it because GameStop's price  
7:19
just kept rising and rising and no new information  was even given or came out. Even the insiders  
7:26
said that there was no reason for it to gain the  traction it did. So, um I would say that it didn't  
7:33
follow the efficient market hypothesis at all. And  then we want to look at some behavioral finance  
7:40
explanations. Um, so the first one is hurting  behavior. Uh, so many people saw GameStop rising  
7:48
that like the price of it that they just wanted to  hop on the train and uh they didn't want to they  
7:54
didn't want to be left behind. So they all bought  at once, which is uh brings me into my next point,  
8:02
social coordination. Reddit had a big thing to  do with this. all Reddit users came together and  
8:08
said, ""Let's buy this thing and drive up the price  and then sell it and burn Wall Street."" Um, so  
8:14
social coordination is just that they all did it  together. And then fear missing out. People didn't  
8:20
want to watch other people make money and be like,  ""Ah, dang it. I should have bought that."" Or,  
8:25
""Oh my gosh, I'm such an idiot for not buying it  and selling it."" And then finally, overconfidence  
8:33
bias. people felt like they were smarter than  the market or that GameStop maybe people knew  
8:40
stuff that they didn't know so they just bought  in to buy in and they finally lost all their money  
8:46
when it crashed and they got burnt. So, um just to  validate all this, we're going to go to GameStop  
8:53
and kind of look at all these uh um the timeline  here. So, as we can see, the uh the stock doesn't  
9:04
really do much from way back in 2000 all the  way up until 2020. It kind of stays right where  
9:13
it should be. Um, and then we see that this keeps  going, keeps going, keeps going all the way until  
9:24
uh November, December, stuff like that. keeps  going all the way there and it's a at about like  
9:33
$2 like we said earlier and it spikes all the way  up to that number that we talked about earlier. So  
9:41
um uh sorry lost my spot found it. Um so we can  validate all this information with that and other  
9:54
sources that we have seen like this one is that  uh it they short squeezed it and then to evolve  
10:06
my points that were made in this um I think a  similar thing is kind of happening with crypto  
10:13
right now. So I wanted to look at it or a case  of it. So, Dogecoin, if you're familiar, um,  
10:20
basically it's just a meme coin and it opened in  2013, but at kind of as a joke, but in 2021, uh,  
10:28
went up like 800% to 7 cents because, uh, Twitter  or X, Reddit, all those, uh, that it got endorsed  
10:38
by Mark Cuban and Elon Musk, which led to people  buying into the hype. And um so we saw kind of the  
10:47
same behaviors in crypto as we did in GameStop.  And just to show you kind of um what it says
11:01
it's all the way down to 17 cents right now,  which is way less. But we kind of see this uh
11:12
we see these spikes. So, here it comes and it's  all the way up to about 60, which when people were  
11:21
buying it for less than 1 cent, that's a huge  turn. Like that's it's up 6,000% from 5 years  
11:28
ago. and uh it's been down as of late, but it's  similar to GameStop as we see this sudden uptick  
11:38
all at once, then back down, then another  swing when President Trump got elected. So,  
11:45
I think it's very similar to that. And then  finally, just to reflect on all this, uh we  
11:50
see that no matter how efficient we believe the  market is, it'll always have its inefficiencies  
11:56
that just are uncalled for. like nobody knew the  GameStop thing would happen and you kind of just  
12:01
have to learn from it. And then also that the  feds got involved with the GameStop thing. That's  
12:08
kind of crazy. And then um I learned about how  behaviors like anchoring um the hurting effect,  
12:16
the overconfidence, like all that uh plays into  how people think. And sometimes it is irrational  
12:26
uh rather than just being smart with your money.  And then finally, I just want to bring up that I  
12:31
I'm gonna personally keep my eye on crypto because  if it keeps having those spikes, it doesn't hurt  
12:39
to throw your 10 $15 in there and see if it  ever shot up all at once. And worst comes worse,  
12:46
you're losing like $15. So, um, that's about  it for me. I thought this case was really  
12:51
interesting and I enjoyed doing it and I hope you  enjoyed learning about my experiences. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"All right, good morning. My name is
Carter Perez and today I'll be
presenting a financial analysis of the
2021 GameStop short squeeze. And our
goal here isn't just to retell the
story. It's to systematically test the
foundations of efficient market
hypothesis using this event as kind of a
case study. And we're going to be
following the driver analytical
framework to structure this
investigation moving from the initial
problem definition and data verification
through a analysis and then a final
reflection on what this means for
theory.
So a little the first stage is define
discover. Our objective is to test
whether the game stop event
represents a true market anomaly that
actually violates the efficient market
hypothesis.
And the first critical step in this
assignment was to verify the stated fact
that GME traded at 4 cents in August
2020. And I looked it up and this is
factual. History shows that GME traded
in a range of roughly $4 to $7 during
that month. The 4 cents figure is off by
a factor of 100. This is a critical
distinction as it establishes the
correct pre-event baseline. So my
analysis from this point forward uses
the verified corrected data.
Next in the represent stage we design
our analytical plan. We can't just look
at the chart. We need to we need a
formal test
and we'll use a standard event study
methodology. First we'll use a clean
estimation window from the year 2019 to
build a market model and find GM's
normal historical uh alpha and beta.
Second, we'll apply the model to the
event window, January and February 21st.
And this will tell us what GM's price
should have been on any any given day.
The difference between what the price
actually did and what our model expected
it to do is the abnormal return. If the
market is efficient, the number should
be randomly scattered around zero. We
now move on to the implement stage. And
I'll kind of show you where that comes
into play here in my collab right here.
Um here define
um we're kind of defining the Windows
and download price for and download the
price for GameStop uh GME. So that's
right down in here.
Uh next going to calculate the daily
logs for both of the tickers. And this
is kind of the core of the rep
representation slide.
There's a regression of the 2019
estimation data.
Um, and now we're going to use the
parameters of the on the 2021 event
data. Calculate the expected return for
each day and then subtract it from
actual run. Finally, you use the
cumulative abnormal return and then
that's in the code here as well
right here.
And this is going to plot those results.
So the code's output gives us these two
charts as shown here. Um the first chart
is one that everyone kind of recognizes
the price and volume spike in late
January 2021.
And the second chart is kind of abnormal
here. This is a cumulative abnormal
return. And as I said in an efficient
market, this line should hover randomly
above around zero. Instead, it kind of
explodes right up through here. and
shows a systematic positive abnormal
return of about uh 300 here
in just a few weeks. So this is concrete
data driven proof that GM's price
behavior was completely detached from
its fundamental risk and market
movements.
In the validate stage, we're going to
interpret these findings and the verdict
is
um unequivocal. The efficient market
hypothesis was violated. So we saw a
weak form violation. So the past price
action or movement was a clear predictor
of the future returns which shouldn't
happen. More importantly we saw a
massive semi strong form violation. So
all the information driving this the
140% short interest all these red
discussions and then uh the m the invol
involvement of Ryan Cohen was publicly
available. So the market failed to
instantly price this in. And this
abnormal return that we calculated
proves that any investor who acted on
this information could have earned
returns far beyond what was justified by
the risk.
So since the EMH model failed, we kind
of need to evolve our own framework
here. The GME event is textbook case for
behavioral finance. Price wasn't driven
by fundamentals, but it was a behavioral
bias. And they kind of did this by
hurting people on social media. And this
event is also the ultimate example of
limits to arbitrary. So the EM
EMH assumes that RA rational investors
would short the bubble and correct the
price and this failed for two reasons.
There's a lot of noise about this uh
trade here. So as the saying goes, the
market can remain irrational longer the
more you remain silent. Number two,
implementation costs. Eventually it
became impossible to short this stock
because the borrowing fees were
astronomical.
And the final takeaway is that this
event does not prove active management.
It demonstrates the extreme nature of
risk. And the primary lesson for most
investors is the value of
diversification.

Okay. So, today I'm going to be going over the uh session session 8 market efficiency and behavioral finance. Um so to today we're going to be going over the uh market efficiency in investigation. So going over the assignment overview, uh we're going to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop GME short squeeze event of 2020 through 2021 as a case study. We verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies

00:00:36
constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So uh first critical step is going to be to verify the statement um GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020 against actual historical data. Um and then if incorrect document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor. So looking at the event timeline uh starting August 2020 Jimmy near nearly goal uh goes bankrupt. uh September of 2020, Ryan Cohen that Chewy

00:01:12
founder acquires 13% stake. And in January 2021, Reddit um uh price surged to $483. And then February 2021, congressional hearings on market manipulation and present postevent price stabilization. Um some key data points, short interest peaked at 140% a float. Uh retail trading volume increased 10fold during squeeze. uh trading restrictions implemented at peak and uh hedge fund capital sustained 53% loss required bailout. Um so starting out with this assignment, we're going to be looking at this short

00:01:51
slideshow. Um so just a project overview, we're going to be going over the market efficiency investigation of the GameStop short squeeze uh 2020 through 2021. Uh the goal is to test how GME's price behavior compares to the efficient market hypothes uh hypothesis uh using the driver framework define represent implement validate evolve and reflect. So looking at define and discover um Jimmy did not uh just to verify from earlier Jimmy did not trade at 4 cents in August of 2020 and the actual price

00:02:28
was around $14 to $1.79 per share uh via or according to Yahoo Finance. Uh more facts. Um Ryan Cohen, the Joey founder, bought 13% stake of September through December 2020. And then January 2020 2021, uh the price surged to 43. Uh and then the short interest was 140% of float, which was a record high. Um Melbourne Capital lost 53% January of 21. uh retail trading volume rose 10 10 times and the broker restrictions Robin Hood limited buy orders January 28th through 29th. So um just some findings um

00:03:18
after going over all this information um some abnormal returns would be um extremely high in January of 21 prices uh moved far be beyond expected levels. Um cumulative abnormal returns strongly positive during event uh which indicates deviation from fundamentals. Um the trading volume increased over 10 times during the squeeze. Uh which in turn retail speculation surge. Um volatility daily price swings of 30 to 50% um emotional and hard driven trading. Um the fundamental value uh analysis estimated 10 to $10 to $40 per

00:03:59
share confirming over valuation at the peak. So um looking at our efficient market hypothesis our EMH evaluation the weak form was uh partially violated um as prices didn't follow typical historical patterns the semi- strong form was uh violated prices didn't reflect available public info moved on social hype the strong form still holds as no evidence of insider info uh driving the event um just some behav behavioral finance insights uh hurting uh which would be investors followed Reddit trends rather than uh analysis

00:04:41
and then people also had fear of missing out which pushed um the irrational buying of of this and the overconfidence traders believed price would only go up from here and yeah for rational investor profitability um profits possible only with perfect timing which would be high risk low predictability after the spike. Most late uh insurance lost money as price crashed and um just some theoretical imple implications. Some short-term efficiency market prices deviated sharply from fundamental value. Um long-term

00:05:23
correction would be prices return closer to uh intrinsic value over time. And the takeaway would be image uh generally holds but um behavioral factors can dominate temporarily. So just to conclude um what we've been going over uh the GameStop short squeeze revealed how social media collective action and psychology can disrupt market efficiency. So while the market was temporarily inefficient, it ultimately corrected um support and EMH in the long run, but showing behavioral finances uh realworld impact.

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Shri. Today I'm
0:02
going to be going over assignment number
0:03
eight, testing market efficiency
0:05
analysis. So today we're going to be
0:07
using the GameStop short squeeze case
0:10
study and we are going to go through the
0:14
driver method. So define and discover,
0:16
represent, implement, validate, evolve
0:19
and reflect.
0:22
So this is our define and discover stage
0:26
where I have to make sure what I'm
0:29
analyzing for this assignment. We're
0:31
basically supposed to figure out how to
0:34
test the efficiency of the market during
0:37
the GameStop short squeeze. So one thing
0:40
that we want to do is we want to start
0:42
verifying some facts.
0:44
For example, one statement that is
0:46
claimed is that GameStop was traded at
0:48
0.04
0:49
cents in August 2020. So that's wrong.
0:52
The real price was actually between $4
0:54
and $5. And we need to make sure that
0:57
this is correct information because this
0:59
is important
1:02
because the market efficiency is all
1:03
about how about how markets react to
1:06
real information. I also checked the
1:08
short interest. This is how a lot of
1:11
people were betting against the stock
1:13
and that was confirmed by analysts um
1:18
basically to estimate GameStop's fair
1:20
value. So by doing this I made sure that
1:23
all of our important parts of our
1:26
analysis and our data were accurate.
1:28
This is a summary of what I mentioned
1:30
beforehand showing that
1:32
yes my professor there is a telling my
1:36
professor that there is a slight
1:37
discrepancy in the data. GameStop did
1:40
not trade for4 cents in August. It
1:42
actually uh traded for around $4 and $5
1:47
during that month. and the stock would
1:51
go up and down. I think the lowest it
1:53
was valuated for was in April.
1:57
But making sure that we know that the
2:00
stock was traded at $4 and $5 is going
2:05
to be really important because that is a
2:09
much higher value than what was stated
2:11
before. This is our represent stage and
2:14
we're going to be looking at our
2:15
abnormal return calculation. We're also
2:18
going to look at our normal return
2:19
interpretation. So, the normal return
2:21
interpretation represents how GameStop
2:24
would typically move if the market had
2:26
no special news or interactions. The
2:29
abnormal return is a return that car
2:32
that captures the market's reaction to
2:36
new special information.
2:39
We're also going to look at the car
2:40
interpretation and that is going to be
2:42
the cumulative abnormal return. and um
2:47
that can help us see if a market has a
2:52
semi- strong inefficiency or not. Next,
2:55
we're going to be also looking into our
2:57
behavioral explanation, whether stuff is
3:01
happening because of overconfidence,
3:04
hurting mentality, or attention bias.
3:09
Moving on to our represent. This is a
3:11
mini timeline and I wanted to organize
3:13
what should have happened if the
3:16
efficient market um was actually like
3:20
supposed to occur and this is important
3:23
because the efficient market hypothesis
3:25
says that prices should reflect all
3:27
available information. So from August to
3:30
December 2020 GameStop behaved normally
3:33
but then a big investor bought a stake
3:35
and the price rose a little bit which is
3:36
exactly what we would expect. But in
3:38
January after in January 2021, social
3:42
media basically um helped uh explode
3:47
GameStop's stock. So like Reddit
3:49
communities convinced a lot of different
3:51
people to um invest in the stock at the
3:55
same time. And this actually caused the
3:57
stock to jump up to $483, which is way
4:01
higher than anything justified by any
4:03
like finance fundamental like uh
4:07
equations. And I wanted to put this out
4:10
here because this really helped me
4:12
clearly separate the rational part which
4:15
is this representation of what has
4:17
happened um from the price movement from
4:19
the irrational part. So the rational
4:21
part is where we see in January and um
4:26
then we see that after late January
4:29
people stopped like investing in the
4:31
stock and then prices started to kind of
4:35
go back to how it should have behaved in
4:37
the beginning. Next we're going to be
4:39
moving on to our implementation. So
4:41
we're going to be going and looking at
4:42
our collab. This collab is going to be a
4:44
little bit long. Um, at first I created
4:48
a collab with all of these different
4:51
types of code blocks. As you can see, we
4:55
have one that's putting out um a car
4:58
around event uh graph. And then we have
5:02
a volume of attention proxies graph.
5:05
Then we have another huge code block.
5:08
And this is going to be showing us the
5:09
same exact types of graphs, but it's
5:12
actually going to be using GameStop
5:13
stocks. So it could be a little bit more
5:16
of a exact representation of what we're
5:18
going to be seeing related to the
5:20
GameStop
5:22
uh you know GameStop stocks. Um and as
5:25
you can see we can see that there's
5:27
movement along um a similar date
5:30
compared to these other graphs.
5:34
Uh and we also have our daily abnormal
5:37
returns around this um you know Reddit
5:40
short squeeze. And then we also have a
5:42
part of a code that is there to validate
5:46
our um findings. You know, looking at um
5:50
their statistical test, an economic
5:52
significance test, a bootstrap
5:53
robustness test, and a persistence uh
5:55
test because those are all important to
5:57
look at to see what is actually
5:59
happening in this market. So that is a
6:01
quick little overview and now we're
6:02
going to go back into our um slides and
6:05
I'm going to go um explain the code by
6:09
segmentation. So in the implement stage,
6:11
I use Python to run an event study. It
6:14
has a standard um like finance. Um I'm
6:18
using the standard method of finance
6:20
that we learned in class to test how
6:22
markets are going to react to a specific
6:24
event. So I loaded um you know the
6:27
necessary like Python libraries for data
6:29
and math and plotting like numpy and my
6:33
event window is uh 10 days before and
6:37
after the actual like squeeze and the
6:40
event window lets me zoom into the exact
6:42
moments where the market might have
6:45
behaved unusually. Right? So next we are
6:48
going to be going and looking at loading
6:51
our simulation and price data. So I
6:53
loaded the price data. I calculate my
6:55
daily returns and the returns are going
6:57
to be showing how much the stock changed
6:59
each day which is really useful for
7:01
analysis rather than just looking at all
7:03
of the prices. Uh for example, you know,
7:05
if a stock is going from $10 to $11,
7:08
that means there's 11 I mean sorry a 10%
7:10
return. And this helps me uh catch those
7:13
big reactions around the GameStop um
7:16
event. And as you can see, we have our
7:19
exact Python code right here on our
7:22
example code snippet to that correlates
7:24
with our section of code. Next, we are
7:26
going to estimate our normal returns.
7:28
Um, our estimated normal returns uh
7:31
should have looked like nothing unusual
7:33
was happening and uh by
7:36
computing this specific uh you know
7:40
property we are going to have a baseline
7:43
of comparison. So then I calculated our
7:45
abnormal returns which is the difference
7:47
between the actual return and the normal
7:49
return. And the abnormal return is going
7:52
to be telling us if the market reacted
7:55
in a weird way based on certain events.
7:59
Right? So next uh I wanted to compute
8:02
our car. Um so I basically uh long short
8:07
or like long for car is the cumulative
8:10
abnormal returns. And this is going to
8:12
be an addition like it adds up all of
8:15
the abnormal returns over time. And it's
8:18
really useful because it shows whether
8:19
the impact of this squeeze um fades
8:23
quickly. And um if it fades quickly,
8:27
that's what an efficient market should
8:29
do. And um we'll also be able to see
8:32
using CAR whether this event or effect
8:36
sticks around for multiple days. So then
8:39
after that I graphed everything. So the
8:42
actual returns, expected returns, our
8:43
abnormal returns, and our car values.
8:46
And this visual is going to help us spot
8:48
the unusual patterns a bit more clearly
8:50
than just looking at numbers. Next up,
8:53
we have um sections 9 and 10 of the
8:56
code. And that is basically I added a
8:59
vertical line marking the event day. So
9:02
it could be easier to see when the
9:05
squeeze happened and when value started
9:08
going up and down.
9:10
So then for my output, I printed out
9:13
some summary statistics to understand
9:15
how strong or weak the reaction was and
9:19
together with all of these 10 different
9:21
sections of code. Um it serves as the
9:25
technical part of my event study and um
9:29
this is another uh part of my
9:32
implementation. These are all of the
9:34
outputs of our graphs. So
9:37
the car graph which is shown to the top
9:40
left is using um data and this graph is
9:45
basically showing GameStop data during
9:48
the short squeeze and you can see that
9:49
our car rises triply around January 25th
9:52
and 28th. So that's going to be telling
9:55
us that there are huge abnormal returns
9:58
during that um time. And as you can see,
10:01
then you see that um the car drops uh
10:04
significantly lower. So that's a little
10:07
bit of the market kind of going back to
10:10
its normal um area. And what you're
10:13
going to see is GameStop had like
10:15
massive abnormal returns from our normal
10:17
expectations, but then it later declines
10:20
and that shows that the market corrected
10:22
that weird jump so with that
10:25
overreaction. So that means that this
10:27
inefficiency in the market was
10:28
shortlived.
10:30
So now another thing that we have is our
10:34
volume and intention proxies graph. So
10:37
the blue line is showing our trading
10:39
activity. So that's technically our
10:41
turnover. And the orange line is our
10:43
social media attention. So that's going
10:46
to be like all the Reddit activity
10:48
that's kind of boosting up people to
10:50
come and um want to buy this type of
10:53
stock. All right. So both spike very
10:56
high on the day that this squeeze
10:59
happened. So what we can learn from this
11:02
is the price surge was driven by social
11:05
media hype and like heavy trading. So
11:08
not by like the fundamental um you know
11:11
practices of why stocks usually jump up.
11:15
So this is actually um reflects
11:18
different behavioral patterns in
11:20
finance. So some of these are called
11:22
hurting and fear of missing out and
11:24
attention spikes and the increased
11:27
attention from people um because of the
11:30
social media interaction
11:32
directly contributed to the abnormal
11:34
returns. So now I'm going to move on to
11:37
our validation part
11:40
and what we're going to do is I want to
11:42
go down and tell you why we did all of
11:46
these different types of validation. So
11:48
we have statistical economic
11:50
significance bootstrap robustness test
11:51
and a persistence check. So the first
11:55
test checks whether the abnormal returns
11:57
are statistically different from zero
11:59
and my p value is around 28 which is not
12:02
that significant but that means the
12:03
abnormal return returns could just be a
12:05
little bit of noise but um
12:09
this noise is actually like consistent
12:10
with the market efficiency. Um
12:14
but next up we want to look at our
12:16
economic significance test. So even
12:18
though our statistics weren't that
12:19
strong, the economic impact was huge.
12:22
The car after the event was around it
12:24
says around 246 uh% which is way bigger
12:28
than any normal trading costs. So that
12:30
basically means that economically games
12:33
price movement was very unusual and was
12:36
very like potentially inefficient. the
12:39
effect was big even if it's not
12:42
statistically showing that it was that
12:44
big. Next, the bootstrap robustness
12:46
test. The bootstrap test checks whether
12:48
the effect is stable across many random
12:51
samples. So, the confidence interval
12:53
like includes zero, which means that
12:55
abnormal returns may not be too
12:57
reliable. So, the effect is not strong
13:00
statistically or robust across samples.
13:03
But now we're going to check our
13:04
persistence check. So the last five days
13:06
of the event window was a negative 54.
13:11
And
13:13
what I want to talk about that is this
13:16
means that the market corrected itself
13:18
very quickly after the squeeze. When the
13:21
market reverse is like this, it usually
13:24
means that the inefficiency was
13:25
temporary. And you're actually going to
13:27
see that through our graphs. So
13:29
basically our final takeaway is
13:33
putting all the tests together. You can
13:35
see that GameStop actually showed a
13:37
temporary market eff inefficiency. So
13:40
that means prices were actually driven
13:42
up by social media hype and people
13:44
wanting to hop on to buying the game
13:47
stock. And um as you can see the market
13:51
actually eventually corrected itself. So
13:53
statistically the results weren't wrong.
13:55
The economic effect was really big and
13:57
you can see that through the number and
13:59
the high jumps in the graphs. And this
14:01
is exactly why we need to actually look
14:04
at the whole picture of finance and in
14:07
the marketplace because sometimes it is
14:10
true that behavioral effects actually
14:13
will take over the fundamentals of
14:15
finance and change the marketplace in a
14:18
short period of time. So now we're going
14:20
to move on to our evolve stage. So today
14:23
we're going to be looking at what this
14:25
game uh stop uh case study kind of like
14:30
what it taught me about the market. So
14:34
it taught me that information today
14:35
spreads really differently. It doesn't
14:37
come just from financial analysts or
14:39
even news channels. I know people on Tik
14:41
Tok who make um videos about like
14:44
trading certain stocks um me figuring
14:47
out like where to telling you where to
14:48
invest based on certain companies. And I
14:51
know platforms like Reddit are pretty
14:52
popular where people go up and talk.
14:54
Twitter is also really popular. So that
14:56
can actually change a lot of um prices
15:00
super quickly. And sometimes markets
15:03
with a lot of social media influence
15:05
tend to actually be more emotionally
15:09
um driven rather than like efficient. So
15:12
basically understanding that emotional
15:14
part of finance can actually help us
15:16
predict what stocks are going to be more
15:18
vi volatile or actually more
15:20
unpredictable. So I mentioned this here.
15:23
So what GameStop demonstrated so online
15:28
communities like Reddit and Tik Tok can
15:30
really drive markets to be less
15:32
efficient or even more efficient.
15:35
Basically these platforms help identify
15:37
which markets are going to be um
15:40
vulnerable to sentiment driven stocks.
15:43
So we have um sometimes we also have
15:46
extreme short interest created in like
15:48
price distortations. So that basically
15:51
means that um sometimes the liquidity
15:55
increases pricing accuracy. So this
15:57
highlights when structural factors are
16:01
um like drive mispricing. So then we
16:05
have behavioral amplification. So
16:07
sometimes behavioral factors overtake
16:10
that rational valuation during that
16:13
squeeze and you can see that because
16:15
markets with strong social amplification
16:17
like social media um platforms show
16:20
mispricing.
16:22
So, this idea that emotions and social
16:26
media can really drive the stock market
16:28
can help professionals evaluate when
16:30
behavioral um differences can be um
16:35
seen, used, or exploited.
16:38
So, next up, I also wanted to relate to
16:41
how this GameStop uh case study can
16:43
relate to all of our different types of
16:44
sessions. So, we have um our session
16:48
seven stock markets. This Gamestock um
16:51
case study illustrates us how GameStop
16:56
shows how fast prices can disconnect
16:58
from reality. Right? In corporate
17:02
finance session 8, we can see that um
17:04
companies might actually choose to issue
17:06
stock when prices are like unusually
17:09
high. And then in capital budgeting,
17:11
which is session nine, we can see that
17:14
um sometimes volatile markets can
17:16
distort the cost of capital. So firms
17:21
have to adjust cost of capital for both
17:23
the fundamental and behavioral
17:25
volatility of a stock. And session 11
17:27
which is valuation. Um basically we
17:30
figured out that analysts must be really
17:32
cautious during these hype driven
17:33
periods because they can change pretty
17:36
quickly.
17:38
So on to my results.
17:41
All right. So what we learned? I learned
17:45
that um psychology is a really big part
17:49
of everything even in finance. So
17:53
even though GameStop experienced a
17:55
really um short-term mispricing, the
17:58
prices actually did eventually go back
18:00
to normal once like people stopped
18:02
getting so interested in it and they
18:04
were like, ""Oh, wait. This is actually
18:05
like not something that I should be
18:07
investing in."" But I did want to mention
18:10
that this behavioral like dynamic of
18:13
like FOMO, fear of missing out and
18:15
hurting and like the short squeezes are
18:19
basically creating temporarily temporary
18:22
inefficiencies, right?
18:25
Um and next thing I want to say is the
18:28
social sentiment and online
18:30
coordination. Um so basically this is
18:33
really big because behavioral um
18:36
decisions in finance can really change a
18:38
marketplace. So
18:43
behavioral um influences can create
18:47
temporary market inefficiencies. So that
18:50
is exactly what I learned from this
18:51
GameStop case. And um what I want to do
18:55
now is I kind of want to talk about
19:00
you know markets are mostly efficient
19:02
but you have to like look around and
19:06
figure out what you want to invest in.
19:07
So, I wanted to um put this part of the
19:11
assignment just because I think
19:13
passively investing can usually work,
19:15
but the GameStop squeeze shows us that
19:17
short-term inefficiencies can happen and
19:20
hype and behavior can take over. So,
19:23
both using the EHM and um behavioral
19:26
finance together gives you a better
19:29
picture of when prices are going to flow
19:32
fundamentally and when they're going to
19:33
break away. So the overall market
19:35
efficiency works on an average but not
19:38
all the time. So that's why I think you
19:41
should combine both of the method
19:43
methods to kind of get an average and
19:47
have a good blend of what you're
19:49
investing in. So overall I wanted to say
19:52
that this game market case study is not
19:55
a universal rule but it is based on a
19:58
specific type of context. Um it is a
20:02
context of different efficiencies that
20:04
varies based on people and how they're
20:06
investing, liquidity, short selling
20:09
constraints and the speed and quality of
20:11
information. Also behavioral loops, you
20:14
know, and so understanding all of these
20:16
different factors are going to help you
20:18
make a better um financial decision
20:21
across um valuation, corporate finance,
20:24
capital budgeting, and even trading
20:25
strategy. And in summary, markets are
20:28
efficient most of the time but not all
20:30
the time, you know. Uh so in effective
20:32
investors need to respect the market
20:35
pricing and stay alert for high quality
20:38
and repeatable inefficiencies
20:40
um uh like post earnings drift or
20:43
behavioral overreactions. So overall
20:48
one thing I want to mention is the
20:50
GameStop uh event shows that markets are
20:53
mostly efficient but not perfect. So
20:55
prices usually um reflect information
20:58
quickly, but during the short freeze,
21:00
the hype and social media temporarily
21:02
pushed um GameStop far away from the
21:05
fundamentals. So my analysis shows that
21:08
large abnormal returns that aren't
21:09
statistically stable eventually reverse,
21:12
meaning that the inefficiency is
21:14
short-lived.
21:16
So this case highlights how EMH and
21:19
behavioral finance work together and how
21:21
they explain real markets. So GameStop
21:24
short squeeze represents a temporary
21:26
breakdown of semi- strong efficiency,
21:29
right? So prices did not immediately
21:31
reflect all of the public information,
21:34
they were kind of distorted by social
21:36
media attention um and like short
21:38
selling like friction. But however um
21:44
once the trading restrictions started to
21:45
set in, the market corrected itself and
21:47
then it restored to long-term
21:49
efficiency. So this event basically
21:51
supports the view that markets are
21:53
mostly efficient but very vulnerable to
21:55
behavioral and structural shock. So to
21:58
verify the stated facts anal analysize
22:01
the price behavior relative to efficient
22:03
market hypothesis predictions
22:05
um what we're going to say is
22:09
this was a temporary breakdown of a
22:11
semi-strong efficiency and markets are
22:13
mostly efficient but they are vulnerable
22:15
to behavioral and structural shocks.

",FALSE,1,"All right. Hello, my name is Gage Pitman and today I'll be discussing the uh GameStop short squeeze and why the efficient market hypothesis failed in this situation. Uh to start the define and discover stage, um we verified that GameStop did not trade at 4 cents in August of 2020. It actually traded between a dollar and 1 cent to $167. And I got this information from Trading View, which also informs me that the current price GameStop is trading at is $24, $21.36.

Now, the all three forms had some sort of failure. Um, you know, the public knew that GameStop was near bankruptcy levels. It was below its market price, well, what it should have been at. Um and hedge funds were trying to drive this price even further down such as uh Melvin Capital which the capital investment officer Gabe Plin is the one who made the call and in the end buried the company quite a bit. The weak form failed because the past price and volume could not predict the future because it was mostly uh financial or behavioral bias uh hurting. People used the Wall Street Bets Reddit form and it took off like crazy. And then the semi- strong form was also violated because even though that the 140% short interest was there the price was not the fundamental value. Instead it was market price which due to the 1.4 four times amount of shares being sold and what was actually available caused this which was due to the hedge funds trying to get themselves out of the hole that they dug and put themselves in by buying more of the shares which eventually resulted in Robin Hood a broker to no longer be able to sell any more GameStop shares and this in turn caused mass panic amongst the retail investors who drove the price up and many of him freaked out and started selling. And this is what the hedge funds wanted was to drive their price back down because they banked on the price going down. One point, the market price did reach $438. It was only valued between $10 and $4 a share. So, you could have made a lot of money or you could have lost a lot of money, which happened to many people. Now, the EMH works in a perfect environment, whereas this was no perfect environment. There was several abnormalities that caused it to go way off track. And as you can see, hopefully you can see this. Um, so this was when it

to the price, which mean it looks like it just keeps on going. And then the drop after the lawsuit in the market manipulation

and the Trading View platform I just showed you is how we validated our information. And after the uh the lawsuit of market manipulation, the price went down, the hype died down, and it remained pretty pretty steady. So, I don't know how to get this off of there.

Okay. Well, oh boy.

But the hurting kind of gave uh gave way to show that you know retail investors have a stronger influence than what a lot of these uh larger firms and hedge funds think which uh afterwards created the ability for meme coins to become a thing where you know things were all about hype. people came out with a a coin or a a stock, not exactly a stock, but a something you could buy. And people bought it out of hype and then eventually it, you know, bit a couple people in the behind and then other people profited from it cuz they got out when the time was right. Kind of like the GameStop situation. But watch out for abnormalities and don't always trust EMH",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Jacob Polackin, and this is my analysis of the GameStop short squeeze, as shown in Session 8.

This assignment is going to go through the full investigation of the event using the DRIVER framework and testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis against behavioral finance concepts.

This analysis is going to show the DRIVER process. I'll walk you through each one of the steps, and I will show you how I built the analysis with the code that I wrote.

My process began with stage one of the DRIVER process: Define & Discover. This is where I defined the problem and gathered the facts.

The most critical first step was to verify the historical data. The assignment prompt asked us to verify the price of 4 cents in August 2020.

As you can see in my documentation, I found this was incorrect. The actual split-adjusted price was around four to five dollars.

I noted this correction and decided to use the correct low price, as the core story of a massive spike is still valid.

Next, I defined the key concepts from Session 8 that I would need. These include the three forms of EMH, behavioral biases (especially herding), and the most important concept for this case: limits to arbitrage.

This is the idea that 'market fixers,' or short-sellers, can be stopped from correcting a wrong price.

As we look more into the Define & Discover process, the main problem was: was the GME event a total failure?

We need to test which, if any, part of the EMH was broken and see if behavioral finance (or mob psychology) explains it better.

The EMH forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong.
For weak: can you beat the market just by looking at past price charts?
Does the price already include all public news, like company reports?
And strong: does the price even include private or insider info?

It's also looking at information incorporation. Abnormal return, as seen in Session 8, measures a 'surprise' return.

We'll use the KISS formula: Abnormal Return = Today's Return - Normal Average Return. This will show us just how not normal the GME squeeze was.

Then behavioral bias: we're once again looking for herding—everyone piling into GME just because everyone else was.

Overconfidence: small investors believing they were smarter than the big hedge funds.

And market anomalies, or momentum. This is when winning stocks keep winning. GME was like momentum on steroids, driven by social media.

Limits to arbitrage is the force that should fix mispriced stocks, like short-sellers. A 'limit' is something that stops this from working.

The GME short squeeze was the limit. It bankrupted the people trying to fix the price.

Then, asset substitution or risk-shifting is relevant to hedge funds. When Melvin Capital was losing billions on GME, they were forced to sell other good stocks to raise cash.

This was risk-shifting, which spread the problem to other parts of the market.

Using this, we defined the 'D' section, and now we're going to move on to 'R'.

For Represent, the objective is to make a clear plan for how we'll analyze the GME event and test the ideas from the 'D' stage.

First, we'll be looking at our data plan using the KISS method. We'll follow the spirit of the code that I wrote in the Implement section, and we'll use this to simulate the GME data.

This avoids needing complex downloads and stuff like that.

Our simulation has three phases:
The pre-event: price is low and stable with low trade volume.
The event itself: price and volume explode upwards.
And post-event: the price crashes and settles at a new level.

Our analysis plan: the market efficiency test will plot the simulated price and volume.
We expect the charts will show a huge, predictable spike, not a 'random walk' which EMH predicts.

Which form was broken? The weak form was broken.
While the price chart didn't predict the spike, public social media data (such as Reddit) did. This public pattern could be used to predict the price, so the weak form is broken.

Semi-strong, which is clearly violated: all public financial reports said GME (and when I refer to GME, I refer to GameStop) was worth $10 to $40.

The price hit $483, proving the market was not using public information rationally.

Then strong-form, which is less relevant for this case. It was a public event, not an insider trading scandal.

Abnormal return, the AR test. We'll calculate AR using our simple formula from the 'D' stage and plot it.

We expect the abnormal return to be tiny or near zero before the event, then show huge positive and negative spikes, proving that the event was abnormal.

Then the behavioral test: we'll look at the price and volume charts together.

We expect to see a price spike and volume spike happening at the same time, as this is the classic footprint of herding.

The fact that the price stayed 'wrong' for so long proves limits to arbitrage were at play. The shorts were getting squeezed.

The rational investor test: we'll ask, 'Could a rational investor have made systematic or repeatable money?'

What we expect: looking back, of course, it looks easy. Just buy at $5 and sell at $480.

But looking forward, it was not something that could have been made with systematic profit. It was pure gambling.

They didn't know if $40 was the top, or $100, or $480. The risk of ruin was massive.
So, we'll argue the risk-adjusted returns were terrible.

Now, as we move on to the Implement section, this is where we're going to take a look at our Python code as well.

What our code does: we have a few different functions.
The simulate_data function creates the three-phase (pre-event, event, post-event) data for price and volume.

run_main_analysis is the main function that checks data, does the different calculations, and plots the three-part chart showing price over time, volume over time, and abnormal returns over time.

And then finally, 'printed answers.' After the plot, the code prints a simple text summary that answers the assignment's key questions, such as EMH violations, behavioral factors, and profit potential.

So this is the output we got after running our code.

The critical first step of data validation: we found that the assignment claim of 4 cents in August 2020 is factually incorrect.
(Sorry, I'll try to zoom this out. Yeah, factually incorrect.)

It's actually split-adjusted. The price was $4-5. Our simulation starts at $5.
So, we proceed using the correct approximated data.

The normal return pre-event was 0.3813%.
And these are the plots right here.

This first chart is assuming the $5 beginning, and then the event happening right here and spiking all the way up to $480.

This next plot is our kind of indicator of herding.
The volume started very low, and at the time of the event, it spiked and continued spiking while the event was happening, showing a classic scenario of herding and a little bit of visual proof to prove that.

And then finally, the bottom chart shows the abnormal returns calculations.
We defined it earlier as Today's Return - Normal Average Return.

As planned, it's near zero in the pre-event phase and shows massive, chaotic positive and negative spikes, also visually proving how abnormal and volatile the event actually was.

And then as we move on, we have some more answers here.
First, looking at market efficiency testing.

We found that the weak form was violated. Predictable patterns in public social media data (or Reddit) drove the price up, and this technical analysis of price was useless.
The semi-strong form was clearly violated.

Then finally, we see that for information incorporation, information was not incorporated rationally.
Behavioral hype... you can call it... the 'hype' information overwhelmed the fundamental information.

Then as we move on, the behavioral finance analysis.
The behavioral biases: the explosive volume and price shown in plots one and two are classic signs of herding and overconfidence.

The limits to arbitrage: this event is a perfect example.
Short-sellers (or rational actors) were bankrupted, such as Melvin Capital, preventing them from correcting the price.

Trading halts by Robin Hood were a market rule issue that further limited the arbitrage.

Finally, the rational investor profitability analysis.
Systematic profit? The answer is no. This was not a systematic or safe and repeatable opportunity.

Looking back and looking forward: looking back, profits look easy. But looking forward, it was pure gambling.
The risk of buying at the peak was losing 90%.
And the abnormal returns shown in plot three show massive volatility and unsafe profit.

With the implementation done, we're moving on to the fourth step: Validate.
To double-check our findings from the 'I' stage and make sure they make sense, we're going to check our 'abnormal' findings.

We found that the 'I' stage plot showed massive, economically significant abnormal returns.
We're validating this: it's 100% true. The event really did happen.

Our simple simulation captures the character of the event, and the real-world facts confirm it was one of the most abnormal trading periods in history.

Then checking our 'gambling' conclusion: we said it was not a systematic profit but rather a gamble.
And this is confirmed by reality. For every person who got rich, many others bought the stock at the top—$300 and $400—and lost almost everything.

This proves it was not safe or repeatable.

Then, checking our limits to arbitrage: we found that the price stayed 'wrong' because the 'market fixers' (or short-sellers) were bankrupted.

This is the core truth of the event. The fact that Melvin Capital, a huge hedge fund, lost 53% and needed a bailout is the ultimate proof.

Furthermore, Robin Hood stopped trading, which is a perfect example of a market microstructure issue—a problem with the trading platform's rules that acted as a limit.

Finally, the robustness check or self-correction.
Our simple AR model used an average pre-event return. The PDF shows the CAPM model... (this is the formula for it)... we could have used that, but GME's beta (or riskiness) was changing every minute, and it was not moving with the market.

Our simple model, comparing GameStop to itself, is arguably a more honest and simple way to show the deviation.

Next, we're going to be moving on to the Evolve section.
We're going to use our analysis to explore 'what-if' questions and think about future strategy.

So, as we move on to this Evolve section... this is the beginning of my Python code.
We're testing a 'what-if' scenario to push the analysis further. The question is: what if social media hype was only 50% as strong?

And this Python code here runs that simulation.
I'm running the script now.
And as we can see... this right here is the result we're getting.

The plot shows the evolved analysis. Our blue line is our original event. The orange dashed line is the 50% less-hype scenario.

As you can clearly see, the price peak is drastically lower.
This test proves that the magnitude of the price bubble was directly tied to the magnitude of the behavioral herding factor, not any change in the company's fundamental value.

So yeah, as you can see, this shows that with less hype, the price peak would have been much, much lower.

And then the application to investment strategy... what this teaches us:
It proves that markets are mostly efficient, but not perfectly efficient.
The behavioral factors of herding and market rules (limits to arbitrage) can create pockets of wild inefficiency.

A takeaway I had was that trying to exploit these pockets is not investing; it's gambling.
For most people, the event confirms that the best strategy is a boring, diversified, passive index fund that avoids this kind of drama.

And once again, this is the final conclusion that my test and my Python code gave us.

So finally, we get to the Reflect stage.
To sum up the whole project and connect it back to the big ideas: EMH versus behavioral finance.

The final synthesis: the GME event is a perfect case to show the limits of EMH.
EMH predicts a $10 stock should not trade at $483. If it does, short-sellers should jump in, fix the price, and make a profit.

And then the GameStop reality: the stock traded at $483. The short-sellers did jump in. They were bankrupted.

In conclusion, the simple, rational EMH model cannot explain what happened in the GameStop scenario.
The behavioral finance model, which includes herding, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage, is the only framework that successfully explains what we saw.

Next, the theoretical implications: active versus passive.
The event does not prove that active stock picking is better than passive index investing. If anything, it shows the opposite.

It shows that 'price' and 'value' can stay disconnected for a painfully long time.
The main lesson for most investors is to avoid these gambles and stick with passive, diversified plans.

The lesson for active short-sellers is that even if you're right with the fundamentals, you can still go broke if you ignore the behavioral side.

And finally, policy implications: what should change?
The event caused Congress to hold hearings. It forced people to ask big questions, such as:
Market rules. Should a company like Robin Hood be allowed to stop people from trading?
Gamification. Do trading apps that feel like games encourage this risky herding behavior?
And short-selling: how can a stock have 140% of its shares sold short? Is that a failure in the system?

This reflection ties together all the financial concepts: EMH, behavioral, limits to arbitrage... and provides a final, clear answer to the assignment.

This concludes my DRIVER analysis.
I've sequentially walked through all six stages: from Defining the problem and correcting the data, to Representing my plan, Implementing and Validating the code, Evolving the scenario, and Reflecting on the final implications.",,0,1

Hi, this is my session 8 assignment for
0:05
financial management and our assignment
0:08
was focused on market efficiency
0:10
investigation. So our assignment
0:12
overview is that investigate market
0:14
efficiency using the GameStop short
0:16
squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case
0:19
study. Verify the accuracy of stated
0:21
facts. Analyze price behavior relative
0:23
to efficient market hypothesis
0:25
predictions and evaluate whether market
0:28
anomalies constitute evidence against
0:30
market efficiency or can be explained
0:32
within existing frameworks. So uh kind
0:35
of before I get into the event timeline,
0:36
we have a critical first step and that
0:38
is to verify if GameStop traded at 4
0:40
cents a share back in 2020 August uh
0:43
against actual historical data and if
0:45
it's incorrect document the accurate
0:48
figures and determine appropriate
0:50
communication approach for correcting
0:52
professor. So for event timeline back in
0:55
August kind of uh we get to GameStop
0:57
nearly bankruptcy levels and then Ryan
1:00
Cohen uh acquires 13% stake. Uh we get
1:04
into a little bit later back into
1:06
February congressional hearings on
1:08
market manipulation and then now we're
1:10
in postvent price stabilization.
1:14
Some key data points is that the short
1:15
interest peaked at 140% a float. Retail
1:18
trading volume increased 10fold during
1:20
squeeze. trading restrictions
1:22
implemented at peak coin Robin Hood uh
1:25
hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 53%
1:28
loss requiring bailout and analyst
1:30
fundamental value estimates $10 to $40
1:32
per share and then I have some required
1:35
analysis that I kind of go uh discuss
1:37
within the driver framework. So, kind of
1:40
before I go into everything, uh kind of
1:43
just easily put the assignment into
1:47
uh Gemini, just gonna get a little idea
1:50
of what I'm working on to give me a
1:52
little uh advice and give me a little
1:53
background information more. Uh I'll get
1:55
further into that with my code. And
1:59
I guess the first step we would be uh
2:01
working on is critical first step, the
2:03
data verification. if GameStop did trade
2:06
at $4 a share or 4 cents a share, sorry,
2:09
back in August 2020. And this is
2:11
incorrect based on his historical data.
2:14
GameStop uh was selling at uh $14 per
2:19
share according to a split adjusted low
2:22
uh back in August 2020. And then you
2:24
also had your actual low, which is
2:27
nonadjusted, which is selling at
2:29
approximately $416 a share. And kind of
2:32
the context behind this is that the
2:33
discrepancy often arises from the 4 for
2:36
one stock split that GameStop executed
2:39
back in July of 2022.
2:41
And the $14 price is adjusted for the
2:44
split, but the actual price a person
2:46
would have paid for in August 2020 was
2:49
$46.
2:51
So basically in conclusion is that the
2:53
statement that they traded at 4 cents a
2:55
share was incorre correct and uh it was
2:59
more uh $416
3:01
what the person would have had paid back
3:03
then and kind of recommendation to my
3:06
professor just be like hey professor
3:08
chang uh kind of preparing this
3:10
assignment I conducted the data
3:12
verification for August 2020 price and I
3:14
found that historical data uh shows a
3:17
different amount uh than what he had
3:19
provided and that people would have
3:21
actually paid $4.16
3:23
a share rather than $4 or sorry4 cents a
3:26
share and this is uh where I'll gone for
3:30
my analysis where I'll proceed using the
3:32
correct historical range data um that
3:35
did occur not the 4 cents so that's
3:38
where we kind of get into the driver
3:39
framework which is to find and discover
3:41
and for the define uh the core problem
3:43
is to test the validility of the uh
3:46
efficiency marker hypothesis using the
3:48
2020 2021 GameStop shorts squeeze as a
3:51
case study. This event saw GameStop
3:53
stock price detach from a fundamental
3:55
value driven by retail investor
3:58
collision against institutional short
4:00
sell shellers and then discover the
4:02
analysis will be a qualitative event
4:04
study. The event is the period of
4:07
coordinated retail buying primarily 2021
4:10
January uh and we will establish the
4:12
normal value range analyze incorporation
4:15
of public information to the piece price
4:18
compare the
4:20
observed price action against the three
4:22
forms of the image and lastly use
4:24
behavioral finance concepts to explain
4:27
anomalies that the EMH cannot and then
4:30
that's where we get to represent and for
4:32
uh analytical framework we will use two
4:35
competing uh but complimentary
4:38
frameworks for the represent which is
4:39
the EMH and then behavioral finance uh
4:42
efficiency market hypothesis your weak
4:44
form semi-form and strong form your weak
4:46
form uh prices reflect all past training
4:49
data Semi- strong prices instantly
4:51
reflect all publicly available
4:53
information. Um
4:56
strong form prices reflect all
4:59
information. No, no one can consistently
5:01
achieve abnormal returns. And in your
5:03
behavioral finance, uh this framework
5:05
argues that psychological biases and
5:08
limits to arbitrage allow prices to
5:10
deviate from val fundamental value. And
5:14
furthermore, we will look for biases and
5:16
the limits to arbitrage.
5:19
Um you have your implement and uh this
5:21
section executes the required financial
5:23
analysis. So market efficiency testing
5:27
um your classification of violation. The
5:29
GameStop event event represents a clear
5:32
and profound violation of both the weak
5:34
along with semi-strong forms of market
5:36
efficiency. The weak form analysis is
5:39
that the entire retail strategy was
5:41
based on weak form data. traders on the
5:44
Reddit uh Wall Street Bets identified
5:47
stocks with high short interest uh from
5:49
past data and high buying momentum uh to
5:52
predict future price squeezes. The fact
5:55
that this strategy produced temporary
5:57
explosive return does violate the weak
6:00
form EMH and you have your semi- strong
6:03
form analysis and this is the most
6:05
significant uh violation. All the
6:08
information used by retail traders was
6:10
uh public. So you have your short
6:12
interest uh in Ryan Cohen stake and the
6:15
fundamental value uh it was 140% short
6:19
interest data that was publicly
6:20
knowledged and Ryan Cohen did uh acquire
6:24
13% uh as a public SEC file and then you
6:29
have your abnormal returns and
6:31
predictability and the returns were
6:33
clearly abnormal uh rising from about $4
6:36
to 483.
6:38
uh more importantly the event was
6:41
predictable. If one could predict the
6:43
hurting event uh predictability was not
6:46
based on fundamentals but on settlement
6:49
and then you have your behavioral
6:50
finance analysis uh the behavioral
6:53
biases the hurting uh this was the
6:55
primary driver. millions of retail
6:57
investors coordinated uh through social
7:00
media act as a single entity creating
7:03
buying pressure no single institution
7:05
could match confirmation bias the Reddit
7:09
of Wall Street Bets uh form became an
7:11
echo chamber diamond hands
7:14
uh that reinforced the belief in the
7:16
squeeze uh filtered out dissenting
7:19
opinions and then of overconfidence
7:22
retailer traders believe that they had
7:23
found a glitch in the market the 140% sh
7:28
uh short interest and could collectively
7:30
bankrupt hedge funds and you have your
7:32
limits to arbitrage. Um this is the most
7:36
uh critical concept the GameStop was
7:39
obviously overpriced at $400. Why didn't
7:42
investors short it down short it back
7:45
down? Uh the fundamental risk is that
7:47
the short sellers uh like Map Capital
7:51
were the rational arbiters and they were
7:53
bankrupt. uh synchronized risk.
7:56
Arbitrage is risky if you don't know
7:58
when the bubble pop. A short seller can
8:00
be forced to cover at a massive loss
8:02
before the price eventually corrects.
8:05
Market microructure issues trading
8:08
restrictions uh like Robin Hood and the
8:10
inability to borrow shares due to their
8:13
high short interest made it physically
8:15
impossible or prohibitively expensive to
8:18
execute the rational short trade. And we
8:21
get into our last one, the rational uh
8:23
investor probability analysis and the
8:26
systematic profit. Um we know a rational
8:29
investor could not have profited
8:31
systematically. This event was an
8:33
anomaly, not a repeatable strategy. Any
8:36
of your risk adjusted returns. Uh the
8:38
returns were astronomical, but the risk
8:41
was infinite. A short position has
8:43
unlimited risk and a long position
8:45
you're buying at $300 a share. uh risk
8:48
90% along with a loss. The sharp ratio
8:52
uh the risk adjusted return of the
8:53
strategy is arguably terrible as the uh
8:57
volatility was just as an extreme turn.
9:00
It was just as extreme as a return. Then
9:03
you have information advantages and then
9:05
you also have your X anti X post. X post
9:08
is after the fact. Uh it looked like it
9:10
was an obvious one and your Xanti
9:12
counter was your before it happened. Um,
9:15
betting your life savings on uh GameStop
9:18
at $20 a share was a gamble, not a real
9:21
rational investment.
9:23
Um, that's kind of we'll get into my
9:25
code now. Uh, just kind of make sure it
9:28
works. Yep, it works. Um, yes, this is
9:31
where I just kind of had put all that
9:33
information through chat. Uh, it kind of
9:35
provided the timeline of what GameStop
9:38
was looking at since not uh since 2020
9:40
of August. provided the key data points
9:43
of the short interest rate, the uh
9:45
acquisition of the 13% and then the
9:48
required analysis. Um also provided the
9:52
financial analysis requirements um just
9:55
to get a better and stronger analysis on
9:57
the entire project. Um
10:00
a little further I this is the find and
10:02
discover uh this is the driver
10:05
framework. Um and now this is where I
10:08
had some like uh help with calculations.
10:11
Yeah. Uh the calculations are all up
10:14
here. Yep. Price. Uh and now I'll kind
10:17
of have like some graphs to help reflect
10:19
it. Um yeah, I have some graphs that
10:22
I'll show shortly. I have the um
10:28
I have a GameStop price and volume short
10:30
squeeze peak and then the GameStop
10:32
versus S&P 500 anomaly compared to the
10:35
market. I'll kind of go deeper into that
10:37
after uh I go through the validate and
10:41
that is uh statistical significance. The
10:44
abnormal return from a fundamental value
10:46
of about $15 to a peak of $483 is a stra
10:51
statistically significant by any measure
10:54
or represents a 3,000% and uh plus
10:57
deviation from its baseline. robustness
11:00
checks. Uh the inefficiency observed was
11:02
not a stable uh arbitrageable market
11:05
feature. It was a temporary
11:07
sentiment-driven bubble caused by a
11:10
unique confluence of factors. Uh the
11:13
extreme 140% short interest, a new
11:15
technology commission, uh pre- like
11:18
Robin Hood, uh new communication
11:20
platform, for example, the Reddit, Wall
11:22
Street Bets, uh CO 19 lockdown stimulus
11:25
checks and boredom. Um so kind of little
11:29
conclusion on that part is that this
11:30
combination is not easily repeatable. So
11:32
we cannot validate this as a p
11:35
persistent failure of the EMH or rather
11:38
it was a black uh swan event that
11:41
exposed the EMH's underlying
11:43
assumptions. So that's where we got uh
11:46
the evolve which is application to
11:48
investment strategy and that is active
11:50
verse management. Uh the GME event is
11:53
like a double-edged sword. It supports
11:56
passive management uh and it also
11:58
supports some active management. The
12:01
evolution of the image um the hypothesis
12:03
must evolve to include sentiment as a
12:06
tangible risk factor. Markets are not
12:08
just equations, they are collections of
12:10
people. This event suggests that markets
12:13
are efficient uh most of the time but
12:16
are highly val vulnerable to behavioral
12:19
uh contingent. Um and that's where you
12:22
kind of get to the reflect part.
12:25
um synthesis
12:27
uh image first behavioral. The GME event
12:29
does not kill the efficient market
12:31
hypothesis but it does deal uh as a
12:34
sever severe blow. It provides that
12:37
behavioral finance is not a niche sub
12:39
field but a necessary component for
12:41
understanding market reality. Uh the EMH
12:45
provides the rational baseline uh $10 to
12:48
$40 fundamental value uh behavioral
12:50
finance and limits to RHI to explain why
12:53
and how the price was able to deviate so
12:56
catastrophically from that baseline. Um
13:00
so you get your policy implications. Uh
13:04
this event directly led to congressional
13:06
hearings and investigations into the
13:09
gamification of trading on apps like
13:11
Robin Hood, the ethics of paying for
13:14
order flow, uh the transparency and tag
13:17
and short interest reporting and the
13:19
centralized power of clearing houses to
13:22
all trade. And this is where now I kind
13:25
of get into those graphs that I kind of
13:27
had on
13:29
uh my kind of related back to my code um
13:32
to the model that kind of helped give us
13:35
a better understanding of everything. Um
13:38
let's see. No, this is just Yeah. Okay.
13:41
This is where all my math was for the
13:43
what it was back in the day. Uh what we
13:45
were trading at. Um, but yeah, as you
13:48
can see, the GameStop price involved in
13:50
the short squeeze peak. We can see back
13:52
in December of 2020, he was at $100, but
13:55
in between it got up to almost 500, that
13:57
$484.
13:59
Um, and then quickly just sank shortly
14:02
after. And it's just kind of talking
14:04
about that short squeeze peak that is
14:06
kind of whole Simon's going over about.
14:09
And then we have our GameStop versus the
14:11
S&P and how uh the anomaly compared to
14:15
the market. And as you can see, the blue
14:18
line is GameStop
14:20
um
14:22
Game uh GameStop and then the red is
14:25
what we saw in the short squeeze peak,
14:27
how it slowly went up, went up
14:30
drastically and then just tanked right
14:32
after. while the blue version of the
14:35
GameStop uh was on a consistent
14:38
uh growth a after uh in 2020 it's
14:42
consistently been going up a little bit
14:44
more. But but yeah, I would definitely
14:48
say um going back to
14:51
uh my critical first step just uh
14:54
indicating that the statement that
14:55
GameStop trade at 4 cents back in August
14:58
2020 is incorrect and it was trading at
15:01
approximately $416 a share. So yeah,
15:05
that is about everything. Um
15:09
and yeah, thank you",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello — I'm Vanessa Prodafikas. For this analysis I tested market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze from mid-2020 through early 2021. My first task was fact-checking. The assignment claimed GME traded at four cents in August 2020 — that's incorrect. Historical data show August 2020 closes roughly between one and one-sixty-seven dollars; August 31, 2020 closed about $1.67. After correcting the data, I framed the main research question: did the GameStop episode violate weak, semi-strong, or strong form EMH, and could rational investors have systematically profited?

Here's the plan I implemented. I use daily adjusted prices for GME and SPY from July 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. I estimate a market model — CAPM-style — in the pre-event window from August through December 2020 to get alpha and beta. Then I compute abnormal returns as actual returns minus expected returns (alpha plus beta times market return). Event windows include Ryan Cohen's September disclosure, the Reddit surge in late January 2021, and the peak with broker restrictions on January 28, 2021.

Now I'll show the code in the notebook. The notebook downloads GME and SPY, computes daily returns, estimates the market model in the August–December 2020 estimation window, and prints alpha and beta. We then compute expected returns, abnormal returns, and cumulative abnormal returns, and mark the three major event dates on the price series. On screen you can see the adjusted close with red vertical lines for the key events. Notice the massive late-January spike that diverges dramatically from prior levels.

Next, I ran statistical tests. I performed a t-test on the full abnormal return series and a focused t-test on the ±10 day window around the Reddit surge. Both t-tests evaluate whether abnormal returns differ from zero. I also bootstrap the CAR for the ±10 day window to get a 95% confidence interval. The notebook prints the t-statistics, p-values, and the bootstrap confidence interval. The p-values are small for the event window, indicating the abnormal returns during the squeeze were statistically significant and not just noise. This is evidence that the semi-strong form of EMH did not hold during the event window.

Why did prices diverge so much? My interpretive analysis points to behavioral and structural drivers. On the behavioral side, retail investors showed herding, overconfidence, FOMO, and anchoring on short interest figures. Momentum dominated as traders chased gains. Structurally, short interest exceeded float, borrowing costs and margin calls forced forced covering and created feedback loops, and broker restrictions interrupted normal arbitrage flows. Hedge funds under stress engaged in risk shifting to recover losses, illustrating the asset-substitution problem under leverage.

To conclude: prior to January 2021 the weak-form EMH broadly described price behavior; however, the semi-strong form was violated conspicuously during the short squeeze because public signals and fundamentals did not explain the dramatic, persistent abnormal returns. Strong-form EMH is not directly proven or disproven here — insider trading evidence is limited — but market frictions and collective behavioral dynamics explain a large part of the anomaly. From a practical perspective, ex-ante systematic, risk-adjusted profits were limited by high costs and tail risk; most profitable strategies are visible only ex-post.

That ends my DRIVER-structured analysis. The notebook exports a CSV of results and a summary file for submission. I will attach the historical price snapshot used to correct the August 2020 price and submit the Colab notebook, the CSVs, and this recording. Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Hello everyone. Um, I'm Ann Pumphrey and to start off this assignment, I needed to verify historical data for GameStop. Um, the statement GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is incorrect. While validating the historical data for August 2020 baseline, I referred to Yahoo Finance data. I found that GME was trading in the $4 to $5 range during that period rather than 4 cents. I have proceeded with my analysis using uh $4. After doing this, I need to test which form of market efficiency was violated. The first form was weak form which means that future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing past prices and technical analysis should not work. Uh this was violated because the short squeeze was largely a technical event. Traders analyzed short interest data and price volume patterns to predict that buying pressure would force a short squeeze. The fact that they successfully predicted price movement based on market structure and price movement suggests um weak form efficiency failed. The second form I tested was semi- strong form. So this means that prices instantly reflect all publicly available information. Um so GameStop violated violated this as well. Um, in January 2021, the price hit $483. Analysts using public fundamental data valued the firm at $10 to $40. The spread between $40 and $483 proves that the price was not reflecting fundamental public information. So, that form was also violated by GameStop. And then the third form I tested was strong form efficiency. Uh so this means that prices reflect all information public and private which this was violated by GameStop. Um if the market were strong form efficient the price would have been reflected um would have reflected the internal panic before the public knew the extent of their losses. Instead, the price was cascaded chaotically and new information about margin calls and liquidity issues were getting released. So then I thought about the question could rational investors have profited systematically and ultimately no. Uh this is due to borrowing costs. Uh to short the stock you must borrow it. During the squeeze, the cost to borrow GameStop shares completely skyrocketed. So that made it um it was unable for investors to have profit profited. Um looking at the behavioral finance, I found two things that stood out for GameStop. Um the first one was hurting behavior. So this means that individuals stopped acting on their own information and mimicked the actions of everyone else. And then I also found um the fear of missing out as the prices rose. Uh retail investors bought because it was rising ignoring the underlying value. Um, so after doing all of this research, I asked Google Gemini to create a code that shows the increase in both price and trading volume. And so here's the code right here. And so ultimately, the code downloads GameStop stock data, pulls a specific numbers for August 2020, and draws a chart showing both the price and spike and the volume spiked together.

So here's my code and so this shows how the data gets downloaded data verification process and then it plots the data and it chooses the closing price and then chooses the trading volume

and um we'll create a chart based off the information that gets downloaded.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"All right. So, our task today was to act
as a venture capital firm and to analyze
the
pro asset pricing model for these the
following three three companies
um
and to give an analysis of what this
means for them. So the first thing that
we needed to do, we need to understand
the data that we're given. And so that
means we need to understand how the
capital asset pricing model works. And
so basically it's a formula to get the
required return of our stocks. So
basically what investors will demand
from the stocks for the risk that they
take. Um and that includes the risk fee
rate. So basically the rate of the
lowest risk option or the no- risk
option which is usually treasury bonds.
The beta which is um
the
measure of how volatile a stock is
compared to the market. So high beta um
highly susceptible to changes in the
market, low beta not much susceptibility
and then the market risk premium. Um,
and that's the difference between the
expected return of the market and our
risk-free rate.
So, our expected return, just so we have
a clear idea of what this is, was 10.5%.
Um, and that's just the S&P 500. And so
after this what we needed to do was
calculate the uh required return for
each of our companies. And for Cloudtech
that's 13.5%.
For regional bank corp that's 9.3%.
For green energy utilities that's 11.1%.
And then as a comparison I used Palance
here which is a very well-known company
and their uh expected or required return
is
20.4%.
Um and so
all this means is th this is the amount
inspector investors would expect to
to uh have put m to get back after
putting money into these stocks.
Um
after this we're looking at our
security market line. And this is
basically the relationship between the
required return and the beta. So uh risk
versus return essentially how volatile
it is for the market and that's how
risky this stock is. like if the market
crashes, you're losing all your money.
And then how much uh you can expect for
that return, like the acceptable amount
that you would need for this stock to be
valued at what it is.
Um, and so what we want is for our
required returns to be
lower than the uh
market
um
yeah or no expected return is higher
than required return. Yeah, we want our
required returns to be lower than our
market expectations and that makes it a
good stock to invest in because it could
be undervalued.
Um, but if it's higher than if our
required return is higher than the
market, it may be overvalued. And so for
most of these stocks, you're pretty
overvalued. Um, the green energy is the
closest to
being fairly valued. Um,
the best one to invest in probably be
Regional Bank Corp as that could be uh
that could that's under the market and
so it could have like that undervalued
thing and it could make us a lot of
money but Palanteer and uh Cloudtech are
overvalued. Um, and the reason that is
is because like like I said, their betas
are so high. They're very uh susceptible
to market changes. And the reason for
that is especially for uh these two
companies, they're providing services
that are in uh
I don't want to say bubble, but I think
bubble is the right word. Um they're
providing services that are based on
demand very much. Like if
say we're in a recession, they're not
going to,
not even say we're in a recession,
they're not going to do very well. Like
the regional bank and the green energy,
they're things that you would need
outside of in regular day life. Like
basically everybody needs energy.
Basically, everybody needs a a bank. And
so they're going to do well regardless
of what the market is. And that's why
their betas are so low. Um, but these
two have high betas because they're
I guess frivolous ones. Um, like they're
not super important to everyday life.
You're not going to you're not going to
see people uh you're not going to see
somebody who's worried about their next
paycheck talking about talent here and
how much uh how much investing in it
could get them. But you are going to see
somebody who who's worried about their
next paycheck, worried about energy and
what their bank is doing with their
money. Um, and that's like the easiest
way to
tell why betas are so differentiated
through different um different
industries. Um, and so after this, what
I did was have AI take our betas and
look at the cost of equity and the uh
cost of capital. So the cost of equity
is essentially the same as our uh
required returns. Um, and that's how
much it would cost these companies to
have investors uh invest in them for the
quarter uh or for whatever period. like
that's how much the investors would
expect to get back. Um but the cost of
capital depends on our debt, right? So
what that means is
here our cost of capital
is
yeah no weighted average cost of capital
uh it's the equity weight of the company
times the cost of equity plus the net
weight of the company times the after
tax cost of debt. And so for a lot of
these company for cloud tech this
doesn't matter cuz we have no debt. It's
completely 100% financed and that's why
its cost of capital is so high. It is as
high as its cost of equity. Um in a lot
of these you don't see that and that's
because they are debt financed. Um
especially for Palanteer I believe it's
debt to equity ratio is like 0.04%.
Which is really good. Um and
that means that it doesn't have to its
cost of capital is a lot lower or not a
lot lower but it definitely is lower
than its cost of uh equity. Um, and for
these two, the cost of capital is much
lower than the cost of equity. And
that's simply because, like I said
before, they're such um the industries
are so necessary that they aren't as
volatile to run or costly to run. Um and
then for the last thing we had we wanted
to
or no not the last thing uh a good
strategy for this we could get some debt
financing in here um for cloudtech to
lower this cost of capital and it might
be able to do that. We could get more
debt financing. We can get less uh
equity. We could have some
we could try to apply for grants and all
that. But uh
that also comes with risk like now the
company's in debt and if you don't
manage that well you're essentially uh
going under. Um for the effects of a
recession I had a look at a normal rate.
This our standard I had a look at a very
bullish market or or yeah a booming
market. Um and then I had a look at a uh
very bearish market. And so
you see that here like the interest
rates uh for the risk-free rates in the
booming and the or no bearish market
it's very low. Um and for the booming
market it's much it's a little higher.
Um and for the market risk premium like
people don't want to invest in this time
so they're going to so it's the risk
premium is very high and that risk
premium means that uh
means that people are expecting much
more in terms of their uh required
returns. Um, so for if we go into a
recession, all of these people want much
higher returns for from uh stuff like
Palunteer and Cloud Corp. But for
regional bank corp, they're okay with a
little bit less. Um, they understand
like the regional bank is what makes
them money, not what makes what holds
the money. And so it their required
return isn't as volatile towards this.
Um, and that's partially because of
their beta. their beta isn't volatile at
all like it's much lower than market. So
they don't need to worry about this
required return as much. Um and then
right here we just have a very clear
graph of the costs uh for here it is. So
like standard
um around 13 bearish uh much higher 15
and then bullish a little bit lower like
say that's 11. And for Palanteer, like
since their beta is so high, like 2.65,
you're going to see those values be
drastically different in these uh and
these bearish and bullish uh scenarios.
Um and the same with the weighted
average cost of capital, you see like
for regional bank corp, it essentially
the same all the way through. Same with
general utilities. And that is because
their betas are so low cuz their
industries are not as volatile as these
two. Um but one thing that
we don't get in this is
a comparable company analysis. So for
CPAM or CAPM, it's a great way to look
at um
how the company does compare to the
market, but it doesn't show us how it
does compare to other companies like it.
And that's something that if we are an
investment firm or a venture capital
firm, we'd need to know. Um, and so one
thing that we could do is comparable
company analysis. Um, and that just
means that we look at the market
relative to these companies like uh
like cloud tech. So since Cloud Tech is
an AI startup, it'd be looking at
companies like Open AAI or if Regional
Bank is a is a banking corp, it'd be
looking at companies like um like Wells
Wells Fargo or Fifth Third. And for
green energy utilities, it'd be looking
at places like IPL, like Indiana Power
and Light for those uh energy companies
and seeing what they're doing compared
to the market and if it's a good
investment for that specific segment of
industry.
Um yeah, and that's one shortcoming of
CAPM. It doesn't tell us that.
Um yeah, thank you",,0,1

(Speaker 1)
Hi, so this is my session 8 assignment. So for session 8 assignments, so the overview is that we want to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 -2021 as a case study, verify the accuracy of state of facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So for the first define and discover stage, so this stage focuses on understanding the problem, making sure facts are correct, and we want to find the main goal and the scope of the analysis. So the primary goal is to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze as a case study. So this analysis must determine which form of the efficient market hypothesis was violated and whether the observed price behavior can be explained by traditional frameworks or requires behavioral finance concepts. The objective is to produce a rigorous data -driven analysis. 

0:01:08
(Speaker 1)
that assesses the GME events implications for the Efficient Market Hypothesis and provides a balanced comparison between Efficient Market Hypothesis predictions and behavioral finance explanations. So for fact verifications, so The claims says that GME traded at $0 .04 in August 2020 and we should probably verify this as this is a critical prerequisite before proceeding with any analysis. So the stated price is $0 .04 and it's mostly wrong because in 2020 there was a it was a price of four to six dollars. So what we did is that we found the actual closing price for GME in 2020 through some research and And because of this... since this was incorrect, the accurate figures and a professional correction approach must be documented within the code and everything. So, key questions to answer. 

0:02:09
(Speaker 1)
So, was the price of .4 cents in August 2020 accurate? And it's not accurate. It was between $46. And we'll answer that later on as well. And which foreign market efficiency, weak, semi -strong, or strong, was violated by the GME event? Could rational investors have systematically profited from this event? 

0:02:30
(Speaker 1)
And what does this imply by the predictability of returns? And how do behavioral finance biases, like hurting or angering, explain the observed price anomalies? And what are the theoretical and policy implications for active versus passive management and market regulation? the first step. The second is represent, which is the plan. So this stage defines the analytical and technical steps required to address the key questions and achieve the assignment goals. 

0:02:59
(Speaker 1)
So we'll be using important formulas and methodologies. So this analysis will be centered on the event study methodology to test for abnormal returns, which is crucial for evaluating market efficiency. So for the formula for abnormal return, so we know is that abnormal return equals your actual return minus the expected return. And the capital asset pricing model, which is also CAPM, will also be used to estimate that expected return. And expected return formula using the CAPM model is expected return equals risk -free rate plus beta times the market return minus risk -free rate. Now for the analytical process. 

0:03:45
(Speaker 1)
So step one, data acquisition verification. This is for critical gates. So is a critical important thing to do. So we want to acquire historical daily stock price and volume data for GME from August 2020 to the present in a relative market index. We get this from S &P 500 and we want to verify the GME price in August 2020 and document the correction. 

0:04:17
(Speaker 1)
Step two is to weak form efficiency test. So this shows the price patterns. So we want to analyze GME's price movements before the squeeze to identify unexploitable non -random patterns, calculate abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns around key event dates using the CAPM framework. And then we also want to test for statistical significance of Abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns and the existence of statistically significant abnormal returns suggests a violation of weak form efficiency. The third step is semi -strong form efficiency tests. So we want to compare the speed of price adjustment to major public views against the event timeline. 

0:05:07
(Speaker 1)
And the massive price surge despite fundamental analysis Analyst estimates of 10 to 40 dollars per share which suggests a market reaction beyond public fundamental value potentially violating semi strong form efficiency The fourth step is strong form efficiency tests. This is more like insider private information So for this you analyze the required data points and the resulting hedge fund losses so like short interest peaked at 140 percent of flow and because of hedge fund losses, Melbourne Capital sustained a 53 % loss. Evaluate whether insiders and regulators could have profited systematically based on non -public knowledge. the extreme short -selling position, though this is difficult to prove empirically. For the fifth step, this is behavioral finance analysis. So we want to identify and analyze specific behavioral biases. 

0:06:04
(Speaker 1)
So herding behavior, this is like Wall Street's best influence, social media influence, loss aversion. and stuff like that, and then also discusses limits to arbitrage, why the price disconnect from fundamentals persisted. The last step, Step 6, is Rational Profitability and Theoretical Implications. So, evaluate the high -risk, non -systematic nature of the profit opportunities to assess if they were truly systematic for a rational investor, and focusing on X -Sand vs. X -Post analysis, and we want to synthesize the findings to compare the EMH framework with the behavioral finance explanation. So, for this, we'll be using Python coding and Google Colab, and we will look at that in the implement stage. So for my code, I put into Gemini my prompt, and it provided me with this code on the side. 

0:07:05
(Speaker 1)
Then I exported it into Colab. Here it is exported. So this one is good. It shows how we're looking for GameStop GME, and then it talks about then it also talks about like an analysis from 2020 so lowest price of august 2020 and um the conclusion is that the four cents thing is incorrect um as we know and then um it gives some things for squeezing peak rise, peak date. um and that's kind of like the code and then we're gonna we run this if we run this it provides us with this output so our gme which is your game stock price analysis so the lowest price gme traded in august 2020 was one dollar and so the conclusion is that the statement gme traded at four cents is incorrect and the actual low was around one dollar analysis for the 2021 squeeze is that the highest price gme traded for during the Jan or Feb of 2021 was $120 .75, and this peak occurred on January 28, 2021. 

0:08:26
(Speaker 1)
So the conclusion is that the statement price surge was $483, which is accurate. I'm going back to the implement stage. So the goal is to execute the core event study calculations and build the empirical analysis required to test the efficient market hypothesis. The action is to build a model using Python, So the critical first step is fact verification and correction. So the initial claim was that GME traded at $0 .04, which is incorrect. So the correction is that the actual split adjusted closing price for GME in August 2020 was the range of approximately $1 .04 to $1 .67. 

0:09:07
(Speaker 1)
For methodology, all calculations will use accurate historical price data for financial analysis and calculations. The analysis uses a CAPM, which is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, to calculate the market -adjusted abnormal return. So the formula for CAPM for abnormal return is GME actual return minus the risk -free return plus GME risk level times the market risk award. Some data inputs, which is assumed is that the estimation period is January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2020, which is 148 trading days. Your market proxy S &P 500 index for risk -free rate is an assumed leverage of 0 .10 % over the period. 

0:10:00
(Speaker 1)
Then we talk about beta estimation. So the beta is estimated from the pre -event estimation period to represent GME systematic risk under normal market conditions. So this is the abnormal return formula again, as we mentioned before. So now we're going to go more in -depth in explaining. So our GME beta, that's your metric, the value is 1 .7. So the interpretation is that GME was 70 % more volatile than the market even before this squeeze. 

0:10:28
(Speaker 1)
This suggests high business risk typical of a troubled small cap retailer. For number two, abnormal return calculation. So this code calculates expected return and abnormal return for the peak and minimum window of January 11th, 2021 to February 1st, 2021. So here again, we have the abnormal return formula. And then we are given the date, GME return, expected return, abnormal return. So for January 13, 21, return was 57 .39%, expected return was 1 .5%. 

0:11:02
(Speaker 1)
So the abnormal return was 55 .89%. For the January 27th of 21, the return was 134 .84%, return was 1 .02%, and abnormal return was 133 .82%. For February 1st, 2021, post restrictions, it was a negative 30 .85 % GME return, a 0 .45 % expected return, and a negative 31 .3 % abnormal return. And then for cumulative abnormal return, there was nothing for a GME return expected return but hypothetically it was around 305 .9 % abnormal return. Then for analytical interpretation which is like market efficiency testing so for the weak form so The car of over 300 is statistically significant. 

0:11:55
(Speaker 1)
This huge return was driven by price momentum and past trading volume, indicating that past price information was not efficiently reflected. For the violation assessment, this was violated. Then the next one is semi -strong form. So the price surge to $483 while fundamental analysis suggested a value of only $10 to $40. So this massive diversion shows the market ignored public fundamental news. So it's also violated. 

0:12:23
(Speaker 1)
And then strong form. The trading restrictions implemented by Robinhood at the peak created an information asymmetry and advantage for those who could still trade, potentially allowing some informed parties to profit in a way that suggests a breakdown of fair access to information, so this was most likely violated as well. Behavioral finance analysis of the failure of the EMH requires an explanation from behavioral finance. So hurting a social media influence so this massive increase in retail trading volume directly corresponds to the positive of normal returns indicating that the returns were not based on new fundamentals but on coordinated collective action driven by social media. for limits to arbitrage. The cumulative abnormal return persisted for weeks because the short sellers losses created an asset substitution problem forcing them to take excessive risk while rationing arbitrage could not correct the price because the capital required 

0:13:30
(Speaker 1)
was too high due to noise trade risk. For a rational investor profitability analysis, so before this fact, which is excellent, so a rational investor based purely on fundamentals, which is $740, would have shorted the stock. But however, due to the unquantifiable risk of this short squeeze, systematic profit was not available in this required margin and model. Volatility made it an irrational bet for systematic investors, and after the fact, which is exposed. While some individuals profited immensely, the opportunity was non -systematic and high -risk. It was a successful speculative bet on an anomaly and not a failure of the EMH in the sense that an average systematic investor could easily and repeatedly profit. 

0:14:19
(Speaker 1)
The fourth step is validate, so we just want to make sure everything's accurate and makes sense. and everything is consistent as well. So statistical validation. So after calculating abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return, we would perform a t -test to confirm if the observed abnormal return is statistically significant. And if the p -value is below the significance level of 0 .05, the results are robust and support the conclusion that abnormal returns occurred. For the logical test check, which is risk return, The absorbed phenomenon is an asset substitution problem and a limit to this issue. 

0:15:03
(Speaker 1)
For asset substitution, so short sellers, they face huge losses. So Melbourne Capital sustained a 53 % loss, which means it had an incentive to take on more risk. Limits to arbitrage, so rational institutions, Institutional investors knew GME was overvalued, but they couldn't exploit the inefficiency because of the high cost and risk of taking a short position, which is because of the short squeeze. And this validates why the price persisted. external benchmarking, so compare the calculated normal return to similar historical short squeezes to ensure the magnitude of the results is plausible for such an extreme market event. 

0:15:54
(Speaker 1)
Five is Evolve, so we're going to have our next steps and everything. So how could we improve by using alternative models? So CAPM limitation critique is that this event study relies on CAPM, which is a single factor model. and CAPM only assumes beta as its only risk that matters. For evolution, we can use a multi -factor model like the Fama -French three -factor model or the five -factor model to calculate expected returns more better. And PGME is a small -cap value stock at this time. 

0:16:28
(Speaker 1)
It's highly susceptible to these other risk factors, making a multi -factor model superior for empirical accuracy. Another thing is modeling behavioral biases. The analysis should move beyond merely identifying biases to potentially modeling them. So, evaluations that incorporate a variable for social media sentiment into the abnormal return calculation to directly quantify the influence of hurting behavior on price changes. Another thing is policy implications. So, this event exposed market myths microstructure issues. 

0:17:05
(Speaker 1)
So the evolution is to discuss the role of payment for order flow and the collateral requirements for brokerage clearinghouses, which were the direct cause of the training restrictions imposed by Robin Hood. And this moves the analysis from purely academic to a practical policy discussion. And lastly, our last stage in the driver process is to reflect. So these are just some key takeaways or lessons that we learned. So the first takeaway is that efficient market hypothesis is a falsifiable in extremes. 

0:17:36
(Speaker 1)
So the GME event provides a strong evidence against the strict forms of the efficient market hypothesis. And this violation of semi -strong efficiency was the most pronounced as the price became completely disconnected from all publicly available fundamental information. The second takeaway is that limits to arbitrage is real. The short squeeze demonstrated that even when a stock is clearly mispriced, which means it's inefficient, rational professional investors may be unable to correct it due to limits on arbitrage. arbitrage, namely the risk of margin calls and capital constraints. And the third takeaway is that the power of social coordination.

So this event highlighted the new reality that retail investors, when coordinated, can act as massive unified force, which creates behavioral anomalies on a system systemic scale and redefines market risk in the age of social media. So this was for my session eight project. Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"This is our section six assignment of
market efficiency investigation. Um
this is session 8 section six. Um our
assignment overview uh we're going to
investigate market efficiency using the
GameStop short squeeze event of 2020
2021 as a case study and we'll verify
the accuracy of the stated facts and
analyze price behavior relative to
efficient market hypothesis predictions
and evaluate whether market anomalies
constitute evidence against market
efficiency or can be explained within
existing frameworks. So, the critical
first step, verify the statement that
GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August
2020 against actual historical data. Um,
so I can look it up right here. I see
GameStop stock and we can go to August
2020
and you can see that it's trading well
above 4 cents. Um, and there's more
weeks into August. Um, a$135. So, we can
say that it was definitely trading at
above 4 cents. I don't think anywhere on
here it's saying it was trading at 4
cents. And uh
we have put this into or I put it into
Gemini as well and looked it up there.
And it again uh
said that the market was trading at
around a dollar and with stock splits it
was like $6
or uh or around a dollar and the stock
splits it still would have been like
around a dollar. It's gone back and
forth. Um, so yeah, we throw that in
there. Uh, so the event timeline, August
2020, GameStop nears bankruptcy levels.
GME is GameStop. It's just their ticker
symbol. Uh, Ryan Cohen, the chewy
founder acquired 13% stake January 2021.
Reddit, uh, Wall Street Bets, uh, drove
price surge to $483. Uh
there was a congressional hearing on the
market manipulation and as of now uh the
postevent price stabilization
and uh so some key data points uh short
interest peaked at 100
140% of float. Uh retail trading volume
increased 10fold during the squeeze
which is incredibly volatile. uh trading
restrictions implemented at peak and
that was on Robin Hood uh which is a
trading app for stocks and stuff. Uh
hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained a
53% loss requiring bailout and analyst
fundamental value estimates $10 to $40
per share.
Um and then we verify all stated
historical data price and document
corrections. So obviously we know that
GameStop was trading at a little bit
more than well not a little bit more it
was actually a lot more than 4 cents a
share in August 2020. Um we'll test
which form of market efficiency weak
semi semi- strong strong was violated.
Uh evaluate whether rational investors
couldn't have profited systematically.
Compare efficient market hypothesis EMH
predictions to observed behavior. Assess
behavioral finance explanations for
observed anomalies.
So, we throw all this in and um
we see that GameStop was struggling uh
in August 2020 and the stock is actually
traded around $167 on average. Um we see
our 10 our 13% stake. Um
we see the peak at $483 and how it
uh increased 140%.
So now we talk about the efficient
market the hypothesis test uh the three
forms weak form semi- strong form strong
form
um
so we can see what was affected or
violated uh so all the past price volume
data is reflected you can't profit from
technical analysis in the weak form and
with GameStop the price surge showed
strong non-random momentum patterns
which came out of nowhere like
what was his name? Roaring Kitty, the
guy on Reddit that decided to uh have
this go viral uh cause non-random
momentum patterns. So this is likely
violated. Um all public information,
news, financials, analyst reports is
reflected. Uh so the price surged $483
exceeding the public fundamental value
of 10 to $40. Um so it's clearly been
violated. semi- strong and strong.
Uh this is not directly tested by this
public retail event, but market
structure issues suggest deeper flaws,
but this one's not aable because there's
no private information that was being
traded. Uh
so as you can see the verdict, and I
agree with this, uh the prices are
rational and didn't reflect public
fundamental information resulting in a
clear failure of the semi- strong uh
EMH. Um why did the price go so high?
um behavioral finance came in. So the
short squeeze mechanism uh there was a
fatal flaw extreme vulnerability uh
short interest was at 140% a float. This
meant that more shares were show sold
short than actually existed and were
available to trade uh the squeeze. So
when retail buyers or stock buyers
flooded the market, the price went up
and then this triggered margin calls for
the short selling hedge funds like
Melvin Capital which has seen a 53%
loss. There's actually a a movie about
this called The Big Short and you can
see uh the effect that this is having on
hedge funds and stuff. Uh there's a
scene in the movie where Roaring Kitty,
his girlfriend or wife uh I forget, uh
like talks to him and asks him how much
they made today. He's like a couple
billion or a couple million. And then
there's a hedge fund uh director. He he
controls the hedge fund. and his wife
asks him, ""How much did we lose today?""
And he said, ""A billion."" And then it
goes again and he lost a billion the
next day. Like it was cuz they were
calling shorts on GameStop stock. And
then since it was rising, they were
losing all this money. Um, and then
there's forced buying and to meet margin
calls, short sellers were forced to buy
back the stock to cover their bets,
which drove the price even higher and
higher. So people thought they went out
too early and then they wanted to get
back in and it kept driving the prices.
Um
there were behavioral biases and hurting
uh retail traders didn't act as isolated
rational agents. They used they acted as
a collective driven by emotion which was
due to uh
this like Reddit page. Uh they were all
driving the price. Uh Roaring Kitty I I
forget the guy's actual name. Uh he had
put out a video saying I want to talk
about a stock. It's GameStop. And they
all went after it. Um,
so they followed the crowd and once
people started to see it go up and go up
and up and up and up, everybody got in
and the buying pressure uh increase and
everybody started to hurt. There was
also FOMO. Uh, the rapid gains fueled a
massive influx of buyers who ignored the
fundamentals just to chase the return.
Uh this is like when you see
a meme coin or something now uh like
Dogecoin uh it was going up uh
significantly in uh 2020 and 2021.
It's like people were just thinking that
this random stock or memecoin like what
we said crypto was going to boom. They
were trying to get in early. They wanted
to be a part of it. They wanted to make
a ton of money. So you're just throwing
all rationale out the window and just
listen to this and everybody was buying
into it. Uh sentiment farming uh there
was uh framed as a fight against Wall
Street and hedge funds. Uh turning the
trade into a social cause and motivating
people to uh hold on for dear life even
as the price became absurd. $483 for
GameStop stock is unreal. Um
it's just absolutely insane to think
about. a failing company had their
publicly traded stock rise an insane
amount of money
limits to arbitrage uh in an efficient
market uh rational investors arbit I
can't even say that word so I'm just
going to say rational investors uh would
have sold the overpriced stock short at
$483 to profit when it inevitably
dropped and uh this process corrects the
price however they couldn't
uh the retail traders acted as
unpredictable noise and uh the rational
investors feared the price would go even
higher before correcting leading to
unlimited losses on short positions. Um
and there were trading restrictions uh
like I said earlier like Robin Hood that
trading app uh broker the they
restricted trading effectively freezing
the market and preventing rational
selling from correcting the price. Um,
so people that were in it and were just
waiting and waiting and waiting until
they could sell for the highest uh
possibility kind of got screwed by these
apps
uh just because the the stock was just
so volatile and there was something they
noticed that there was something
definitely wrong with it
and uh rational profitability
uh before the fact. No, a truly rational
investor following fundamentals would
have either avoided the stock or shorted
it just like the hedge funds did. Um,
I mean, a a failing company like that,
people are going to short it. And the
fact that it went up, no rational person
was betting or making calls on GameStop
stock to go up. Um, it's just not very
smart.
um after the fact, yeah, people would
have like bet on bet on this and made
money off this uh just because it it was
going up and everything. So,
yeah, now that we see that it went all
the way up to $483, it would have been a
good idea to invest, but you you would
have never known before uh that fact. Uh
so the EMH uh versus behavioral finance
uh the GameStop event was temporary
random bubble that eventually popped
proving that uh prices must return to
fundamental value in the long run. Uh
behavioral finance finance's view uh
this event proves that the psychological
biases and market flaws can sustain a
massive mispricing for extended periods
making market efficiency a poor
description of reality in a short term.
Um
Keith Gil of course I had the slide
that's what his name was. Roran Kitty.
Um,
they actually did it again. Um, I know
he came back. I saw it in the news. He
came back and I think they did the same
thing with GameStop stock. And I think
that's what this is right here. Um, this
uh jump from down here. So, as you can
see, this is this area right here is if
I could get this ticker away.
This area right here. I can't get this
away. But um this is where it happened.
This is where they all went crazy. And
then as you can see, it slowly slowly
slowly goes down, goes down, returns
back to normal. And then he made his
return and said something again. He
posted another video. Let's like let's
do it again. Um but obviously they're
violating the uh EMH.
And then uh
yeah and then here's the
the coding used to uh calculate that
stuff with the 140% increase and stuff
and uh yeah so the perfects you can see
the purposes of the code uh right here
um data retrieval basic for all the
empirical tests of the image uh
verification
uh that was for the the stock price key
metrics, the abnormal returns and daily
returns, the volatility and abnormal
returns. Um,
but yeah, that talks about the GameStop
stock. Um,
we we talked about the behavior relative
to the efficient market hypothesis, it
violated it. Um, whether market
anomalies constitute evidence against it
or can be explained existing frameworks.
Yeah, we talked about that as well. Um,
but yeah, all in all, it was a very uh a
very interesting time in the stock
market and in the GameStop stock.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"0:03 Alright, so, Solution 8, assignment, and it goes through the analyst paradox, okay.
0:16 So we did all that, you know, the assignment. And it's got a case study, and it's on that market efficiency and estimation.
0:24 Uhh, analyzing GameStop. Uhh, and then the critical step is, GameStop traded for 4 cents in August of 2020. So we have to go, And it gives us a timeline and key points.
0:43 So we first went and then we verified, August of 2020. So, this, You was traded for 4 cents, so, it was not traded for 4 cents, so I asked Google to help me explain it in the simplest way.
1:24 So, when I first did, it was made a driver framework. Umm. Umm. Umm. You can pause and read it. Umm.
1:42 So, what I did is I had, I wrote, I had to keep it simple on how to write the code if I could do it over here.
1:53 I did it in steps, so I'll run one. Actual approximate price in August of 2020 was $4. The correct thing to claim before us is highly inaccurate.
2:10 It was a hundred times higher, yep. So, and then we did all the math for it. And I had, so I wanted to see some, umm.
2:25 The store code theta, so it pulled it and made it into some graphs. Again, this uh, the assignment was to do the case study.

Okay, this is my session eight
0:04
assignment. Let's get OBS out of here.
0:07
So, the thing we're looking over today
0:09
is the GameStop short squeeze in 2020 or
0:14
in late 2020, early 2021. Uh we're
0:18
looking at a case study trying to
0:19
analyze really what happened here. So,
0:21
the first thing I want to do is look
0:23
over at the discover part of Driver. See
0:26
what actually are we doing here. So I
0:28
think the first and most important thing
0:29
when you're looking at a case like this
0:32
is to just gather information and figure
0:34
out like okay what actually happened
0:36
here. Uh the next thing that I want to
0:39
look at is kind of downline try to
0:41
analyze what happened here and to do
0:43
that you want to look at uh the
0:46
efficient market hypothesis forms see
0:48
which one this really qualifies as. Look
0:51
at the efficiency of the market during
0:54
that time. look at uh
0:58
how quickly and accurately the market
1:00
reflected information specifically in
1:03
something like this where the price of a
1:05
stock rose and fell
1:07
unbelievably dramatically over the
1:09
course of like a week or two. Uh look at
1:13
some behavioral biases that could have
1:14
occurred during the time. Look at market
1:16
anomalies that could have occurred
1:17
during the time. Uh things like that.
1:20
look at limits to arbitrage,
1:23
which is when um
1:26
I add it a second ago. I'm pretty sure I
1:28
explain it later in the presentation,
1:32
but
1:33
uh
1:36
yeah,
1:37
for so the first thing I want to do is
1:40
really just look over what happened
1:41
during the case. There is a little bit
1:44
of context here. There's the event
1:45
timeline. Uh,
1:48
I looked over whether or not most of
1:49
this is true. It is. It gives you a
1:52
pretty good picture as to what happened,
1:54
but basically the
1:58
overall
2:00
uh look at what happened here is in
2:04
before
2:06
or Okay, what I should probably show is
2:08
this. As you can see, their stock price
2:10
from when they went on the market in
2:12
2002 up until this should be Yeah. late
2:17
2020 was somewhat consistent and then
2:19
all of a sudden you see it randomly
2:21
shoots up through the moon. What ended
2:23
up happening here is a lot of big hedge
2:26
funds had decided to short GameStop
2:30
right around this time in late 2020.
2:33
And so basically they were betting that
2:35
the stock price would end up going down.
2:38
And something that usually ends up
2:41
happening with a lot of these hedge
2:42
funds is they all tend to
2:47
uh a good way to put it would be eaten
2:49
the same patch of grass so to say. So if
2:53
a bunch of if a couple of different
2:55
hedge funds find an op uh what they
2:57
would consider a good investment
2:59
opportunity, a lot of the others will
3:01
tend to latch on to the same investment
3:03
opportunity, which
3:06
uh there are plenty of reasons for that.
3:08
But that is an anomaly that ends up or
3:10
not anomaly necessarily, but it's
3:12
something that ends up happening where
3:13
if a couple of investment firms find an
3:15
investment opportunity such as short and
3:17
GameStop, a bunch of the other ones will
3:18
latch on to it. It'll cause the the
3:22
impact won't be one hedge fund. It'll
3:24
typically be multiple.
3:26
But essentially what happened is they
3:28
ended up trying to short GameStop and
3:30
then a bunch of people caught wind of
3:32
this through uh SEC filing information
3:36
and they saw that okay if all of these
3:38
people are taking shorts that gives us
3:40
an opportunity to as we see back up here
3:45
that gives up gives us an opportunity to
3:47
cause a short squeeze which is basically
3:49
where if a bunch of people remember if
3:51
they're shorting they're betting on the
3:53
price going down. If a bunch of people
3:55
flood money into the stock and the
3:56
invest and the price goes up, it causes
3:59
those people to go, ""Oh boy, wait a
4:01
minute. The stock price isn't going
4:02
down. We're about to lose who knows how
4:04
much money."" And then sell the stock at
4:07
a loss. And which will then cause the
4:10
price to go even further because they're
4:12
selling the stock at a loss. And that's
4:14
essentially why you see this somewhat
4:17
random jump in stock price. Another
4:21
piece of this that was
4:25
uh somewhat more difficult to research
4:27
is how
4:29
the uh
4:31
I keep clicking on this by the way. What
4:33
this is I was just trying to verify that
4:36
Ryan Cohen did buy that 13% stake
4:38
according to the Wall Street Journal. He
4:40
did. So that did actually happen. But
4:42
one of the big uh parts about this is
4:47
that it was a bunch of people on Reddit
4:48
that ended up causing the short squeeze.
4:50
I wasn't able to find much information
4:52
from something like the Wall Street
4:54
Journal from that, but Wikipedia does
4:56
have a decent amount of information on
4:57
it. And essentially, I'm not going to go
4:59
through and read this whole thing, but
5:01
essentially what happened is a bunch of
5:02
people on a Reddit forum had realized
5:05
that well, someone first and foremost
5:08
said that this was a good investment
5:11
opportunity to begin with and he got a
5:14
bunch of people on board with him that
5:16
hey, there's a huge opportunity here if
5:18
we're able to pull our money together
5:19
and cause that price to go up, which is
5:22
essentially what ended up happening.
5:25
So that's a overview really of the case.
5:30
So then the next thing we want to do is
5:32
kind of analyze some of what happened
5:34
here.
5:36
Uh I can I go back and show my prompts.
5:41
Yeah, it's up there. Uh the prompt is
5:43
kind of long. A short summary of what
5:46
ended up happening here is every time it
5:48
would generate the code, I was trying to
5:49
get it to use the actual stock numbers
5:52
and it would put a search reference into
5:55
the code which it was unable to execute
5:58
and it kept filing errors. So, this
6:00
prompt is really drawn out because I had
6:02
to keep coming in and changing the
6:03
prompt to try to get it to actually
6:06
embed the financial information instead
6:08
of trying to search for it with Python
6:11
code because it's not going to work. But
6:13
essentially what I wanted it to do is
6:15
make a couple calculations regarding
6:17
what happened and then give uh a little
6:20
bit of analysis regarding things like
6:22
risk and market volatility.
6:25
So then as we can see here the first
6:28
thing that we ended up calculating is
6:31
the EMH classification
6:34
and it's decided that it's a classic
6:37
case for the semi strong form. Uh I
6:41
agree with this and as you can see the
6:43
reasoning for it is an example of a weak
6:46
form would be uh
6:49
it states all price and volume data or
6:54
all doesn't state it. An example of the
6:57
weak form would be that all past uh
6:59
price volume data is in the price. This
7:02
isn't true because as it says momentum
7:04
was a huge factor here. What ended up
7:07
happening is a lot of the trading within
7:11
this couple of days, people saw that the
7:15
stock price of GameStop had gone up by
7:18
130%. And they without any idea as to
7:21
how or why this ended up happening
7:23
decided to just jump on the train and
7:25
make uninformed decisions to buy
7:26
GameStop because they saw that the price
7:29
had shot up randomly. This ended up
7:31
working out for some people, but a lot
7:34
of what happened here was momentum and
7:36
had nothing to do with the price or any
7:40
financial indicators whatsoever. It was
7:43
just people jumping on the craze really.
7:46
And then the semi-strong form, which is
7:49
what we probably think it is, states
7:52
that all publicly available information
7:54
is already in the price. This is true.
7:57
Something specifically to look at is SEC
7:59
filing and shorts interest data because
8:02
a lot of the way that people are able to
8:04
identify that there is a market
8:07
opportunity there is looking through SEC
8:10
filings to find that all of these hedge
8:12
funds are pumping money into the short
8:14
position.
8:17
uh
8:19
some yeah this just says the fact that
8:21
GME was uh 140% of their public float
8:25
which is the
8:28
uh total of like the shares that are out
8:30
there to buy was shorted. This was
8:32
public knowledge so people were able to
8:34
see this. The stock's price before the
8:37
squeeze was $4, which didn't really
8:41
fully reflect the short position for
8:44
this.
8:46
And then this also goes into a little
8:48
bit about how the a lot of the investors
8:52
on Reddit were able to find this data
8:54
and then act on it, which kind of proves
8:57
that it was wasn't priced correctly,
9:00
that it is the semi-strong form. Then
9:02
looking at why it's not the strong form,
9:03
it states that all information is in the
9:06
price, this really can't be true because
9:11
uh
9:15
if you look at all of the public data,
9:17
if this was true, the stock valuation
9:21
wouldn't have been off by this much. And
9:23
there was probably some stuff going on
9:25
behind the scenes here to try to adjust
9:28
the price. So that's why that probably
9:30
wouldn't be true.
9:32
This is a value assessment before the
9:35
squeeze just to see if there was any
9:37
actual uh value there because as I
9:40
mentioned earlier, some of the people
9:42
involved from the Reddit side of things
9:44
in initiating the squeeze, some of them
9:47
had already decided well before the
9:50
squeeze that there was potential growth
9:53
in this stock regardless of the shorts.
9:55
At first, it tried to do a P evaluation,
9:58
but this isn't really possible because
10:00
the company wasn't profitable at that
10:02
time. So, instead, it did a PS
10:05
valuation.
10:06
And
10:08
what it found from that is the PS ratio
10:10
is 087, which means that the implied
10:13
fair value per share based on that ratio
10:16
is $6963.
10:19
Obviously, at this point, it was trading
10:20
at $4 a share. So there's a huge
10:22
discrepancy between the fair value and
10:25
what it's actually trading for which is
10:27
what this says is that the stock was
10:29
highly uh the stock was actually highly
10:32
fundamentally undervalued since there
10:34
was a opportunity there regardless.
10:39
Um this is part of this section but it's
10:42
not really fully connected to it. some
10:44
of the abnormal returns during the
10:46
event. The return on GameStop was 132%
10:51
during the course of I think
10:55
for the peak day which is incredible. Uh
11:01
some things to look at the S&P 500's
11:03
return that day is negative -2.44%
11:06
which means the beta was 1.8. What this
11:10
shows is that there was absolutely zero
11:13
correlation between the return of
11:17
GameStop and the S&P 500. They were not
11:21
doing the same thing whatsoever. They
11:23
were not connected to each other.
11:26
Uh this is a conclusion basically saying
11:30
that this goes all the way out here.
11:38
Yeah, it was it's basically saying that
11:40
the events of that
11:43
uh couple of days were abnormal and
11:46
aren't something that you would
11:47
typically expect out of stocks.
11:51
Like some things to look at is before
11:53
the period which is in December. So
11:55
before the short squeeze happened, the
11:58
average daily return was 4%, the daily
12:00
volatility was 19% which are somewhat
12:04
regular. And then during the period
12:06
which was in January right after the
12:08
stock price shot up the average daily
12:11
return was 43%
12:13
and the daily volatility became 56%. So
12:17
there was just a giant spike in
12:20
potential return. The volatility the
12:22
sharp ratio tripled just about in that
12:25
time. So those are things to look at
12:29
when analyzing
12:31
what happened in the case.
12:35
This is a graph showing the
12:39
price of GameStop and then the price of
12:43
the S&P 500.
12:46
Uh, as you can see beforehand, the price
12:49
of GameStop was steady and then here we
12:51
see it shoot up, shoot down, shoot up,
12:53
shoot down. And then what's funny is you
12:56
do actually see right here some inverse
12:58
correlation between that and the price
13:00
in the S&P 500. when GameStop shoots up,
13:02
the S&P 500 shoots down, and then you
13:06
can see they're somewhat inverse to each
13:08
other.
13:11
Uh, let's see. There's other things that
13:13
I need to go over here.
13:18
I did look into the short interest
13:20
peaked 100% 140% of float. That was
13:23
true. Uh, reassec 10fold during the
13:26
squeeze. If you go here,
13:30
uh, before this squeeze, the volume was
13:34
right before it, it was shifting quite a
13:37
bit, but usually it was somewhere in the
13:40
region of 400 million and then at the
13:44
peak of it, it was trading the trading
13:47
volume became 5 billion. So yeah, it
13:51
shot up by quite a bit.
13:54
What else? Oh, something else to talk
13:56
about. Trading restricted restrictions
13:59
implemented at peak. What ended up
14:01
happening here is right when it hit its
14:04
peak, some investing platforms, the most
14:07
uh known of which and I guess the one
14:10
that got a lot of slack for it, Robin
14:12
Hood, ended up saying that you couldn't
14:14
trade GameStop on their platform, which
14:18
caused a really big stir because people
14:21
were
14:22
from their perspective, they were saying
14:24
that they couldn't keep up with some of
14:27
the customer demand and stuff like that.
14:29
But some people were trying to say that
14:31
they were trying to cover for the hedge
14:35
funds that were losing an unbelievable
14:38
amount amount of money, such as Melvin
14:40
Capital, who basically just about went
14:44
under for this. Basically, they're
14:46
saying that Robin Hood ended up uh
14:49
trying to cover for these capital firms.
14:51
This obviously if you're uh a user of
14:55
Robin Hood is a huge issue because if
14:57
they can decide that you're making too
14:59
much money one day and that their
15:00
investor buddies are not making enough
15:02
money, this is obviously a huge issue.
15:05
And they had a really big PR spat about
15:08
that. It also, I believe, ended up going
15:11
into Congress. Yeah. Up here it talks
15:13
about a little bit congressional
15:14
hearings on market manipulation. it. One
15:18
of the things that got brought up is
15:19
whether or not Robin Hood is able to do
15:21
that. And I believe they ended up saying
15:23
that they uh depending on the scenario,
15:26
they were, but I don't know when the
15:28
next time we're going to see something
15:29
like this is. So, there's that.
15:33
Uh the fundamental value estimates $10
15:35
to $40 per share. We ended up estimating
15:38
like $60 per share, but it was much
15:40
higher than what the stock was valuated
15:43
at. So, that is what it is. Uh other
15:46
stuff to look at
15:49
already talked said this was semi-
15:51
strong whether rational investors could
15:53
have profited systematically. Uh as I
15:56
said earlier the stock ended up being
15:57
severely undervalued regardless of the
15:59
short happening or the regardless of the
16:02
squeeze happening. So people could have
16:05
profited from it regardless of that.
16:08
Compare efficient market hypothesis
16:10
prediction to observe behavior finite
16:13
explanations
16:15
uh
16:17
for observe some potential behavioral
16:21
reasons that this happened is I I
16:23
mentioned I talked about a little bit
16:24
earlier but what a lot of people ended
16:26
up doing is when they saw the stock
16:28
price within a couple of days go up by
16:32
what was that before it was trading at
16:34
like a dollar and up at $100. When
16:37
people see that, a lot of people were
16:39
just looking, people, investors I should
16:41
probably say, when investors saw that,
16:43
they were just looking to jump on the
16:45
craze and try to make money. And this
16:47
ends up basically clouding up the actual
16:50
value of the stock completely because
16:53
usually the value of the stock is tied
16:55
to things like the beta or the P ratio.
16:58
And what it was tied to was literally
16:59
just the stock price. People were just
17:01
betting that it would go up regardless
17:02
of what was actually happening within
17:04
the company.
17:06
So, I think that's a behavioral thing to
17:09
look at.
17:11
It's not very repeatable because I don't
17:12
think that happens very often, if really
17:15
ever. But I think that was a big
17:17
behavioral issue that ended up affecting
17:20
the price of the stock then
17:27
I believe.
17:29
Just want to make sure I'm hitting
17:30
everything here.
17:34
Uh, okay. Okay, if I didn't go through
17:35
the rest of this, I'll do it now. For
17:37
the R part of the driver, the represent
17:40
I wanted to ensure the given information
17:42
in the scenario is correct and then test
17:43
the validity of the data using resulting
17:46
from the financial calculations
17:49
for the I part implementing it.
17:51
Obviously, that was me going in
17:52
generating the code, getting it into
17:54
collab, all that stuff for validating
17:56
it. I end up doing quite a bit of that
17:58
because at first the code wasn't
17:59
working. So I had to go back in and try
18:01
to reimplement it for uh the E part uh
18:06
was fix potential issues that were found
18:09
during the implementation and validation
18:10
stages. Again, I had to go do that a
18:12
bunch of times because it was not
18:14
implementing correctly. Then present
18:16
findings in a clear, informative, and
18:17
concise manner. That's what I'm trying
18:19
to do right now. So I think yeah, that's
18:23
about it. Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"""All right, so this is the session eight assignment. Um, we basically have to analyze the GME short squeeze event by examining GME and the market data, calculating the returns and volatility, uh, visualizing prices and return behavior, and evaluating the event against the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) to identify anomalies and discuss potential, uh, explanations. So, to start, um, we analyzed right here, sorry, I'm also pulling up my notes. Okay. Um, so, the first part here is to examine the GME and the market data. So, we have our code right here that basically takes the statistics from, um, the websites right here to print them out. So, this is what we get. Uh, to kind of sum it up a little bit quick, this is the data frame. So, for the first five rows, um, looking from 2020, um, of June, um, all the way from the first to the fifth, we have the close GME, the high GME, the low, the open, and the volume. Um, and then we have the market data frame for the first five rows as well. So, the close, the high, the low, open, and volume for the SPY values. Um, so you would have all that data right here. Um, and then we can kind of see right here, um, it categorizes and and notes it very simply for us. Um, to get the describe or the descriptive statistics. So, we have count, mean, like we have all these statistics that we could use, um, to just help us understand the main objective here, which is analyzing that. Um, so to simplify the data across the manipulation, they will, uh, standardize the columns of both GME and market from Gemini by the way, of data frames by collapsing the multi-index columns into a single level. So, um, we have some code here that will print out the GME data frame columns, so the index would be the close, high, low, um, open, volume, stuff that we saw up here. Right. And then to also get a visual examination of kind of how the trends work, we have, uh, a bunch of graphs right here that is printed out for through the data. So, we have the GME close price over time. Um, you can see it goes kind of slowly up and down and then it goes skyrocketing up and then falling right back down, and then continues to go a little bit up. Um, same with the trading volume. This one's a little bit more up and down, so it's less, uh, consistent. Um, and then the closing price also has a positive correlation, and the trading volume over time is also a very just up and down thing right here. So, you can see those graphs and kind of get a more visual understanding. Um, so then to calculate the returns, um, we just take the data from the top. Um, so we get the standard deviation of the returns, which for GME would be $0.1876$ and for the SPY, it would be $0.0112$. Um, and then to visualize again the price return behavior, we have more graphs here for us. So, we have the GM close price over time. Um, and then, actually, these look very similar to these. Also, you can see kind of analyzing how they, um, work. There's a few differences that I see, but mainly they look pretty identical, um, for all those four figures as well, with the same deviation. Um, so now, based on our price and return analysis, we also need to understand how the behavior aligns and deviates from the efficient market hypothesis. Um, so here we have another chart. This one is, um, the GME price data for August of 2020. So, we have some important here dates from the 3rd all the way to the 31st, which show us our close, our low, open, and high rates right over here. Um, and Gemini, or I guess Colaboratory, has a feature where we can extend and understand and format it in different ways and entries. Um, so now to verify the GameStop traded for a $0.04$ in August of 2020, we need to basically review the GME, um, data frame from August of 2020 and it is clear that they did not trade for $0$ and uh, or I guess $4$ cents during that period. So, with what we learned up here and the ways the statistics are calculated, Gemini was able to take all that information, put it into the, um, algorithm, and then tell us the answer to our main objective question, which is that GameStop did not trade for uh, $4$ cents during that period. So, when, um, kind of looking at all this data right here, we were able to understand just how we can see it. Because with our visual right here, we have more of an idea of what correlations to look for, and it not necessarily helps us answer the question from just our mind, but um, having an algorithm where we can actually put a real-world situation into, can help ease the time and process to make sure that we're not spending so much time analyzing stuff when we have AI that can do it for us. So, right here, um, there's some key observations that Gemini has pointed out for us. One is the price action. So, prior to late of 2020, the prices were relatively stable and low for trading, mostly in single digits, and then around late 2020, that's when they saw the uptake for that. The daily returns were vividly shown in periods of exceptionally high volatility. So, before the surge, returns were typically within a narrow band, and then during January 2021, it's been swinging widely. Um, some other important ones is the again, the price action and the daily returns for SPY, very similar to our GME up there. But overall, it's important to know that the data from the late 2020 and early 2021 clearly show a period of extreme price dislocation, characterization by an exponential price surge. Um, and we have a lot more information that Gemini talked about over here. But to kind of just talk, um, a little bit about how driver fits into this framework, um, so defining the problem, the main question was, is, you know, the GameStop short squeeze of 2021 consistent with the efficient market hypothesis, which Gemini was able to answer for you. Um, for research, we had to do a few things. So, we had to first fact-check, um, ourselves, because no matter how much the algorithm can make this easy, it's important for us to also give it a double check, um, and the claim that it was traded for, uh, $4$ cents was false. Um, it was verified it was more $1.4$ to $1.7$ in the in late August of 2020, and this was through Yahoo Finance. Um, and so after getting all that, we were able to make an algorithm that was making sure it was spinning out the right values, calculating and pulling from correct databases to make it, or to give us the right answer. Um, to interpret the data, we were able to see the past returns and predict the future returns, price change around major news, compared to the market, and market overreactions and volatility. To verify our findings to make sure the algorithm was doing a good job, we cross-checked from Yahoo Finance, like I mentioned, Bloomberg, and just confirmed the August 2020 prices. Um, to evaluate, we wanted to see if EMH failed or not. So, short squeezes and social coordination introduce behavioral bias, uh, hurting FOMO and overconfidence, showing that behavioral finance can be a better explain real-world outcomes. To reflect over the report, um, we've realized that it's very important to combine the EMH and behavioral finance to get a full picture of what we're talking about and not just picking apart because truly it takes a lot of puzzle pieces for all this to make sense. Um, but yeah, that is my Session 8 assignment, and I hope you have a good day.""",,0,1

what this all means. I used real data
from Yahoo Finance
and new sources and I generated visuals
such as abnormal returns volume analysis
and a short interest graph. And my goal
is essentially to explain
um to just anybody like it could be your
friend or it could be someone who knows
nothing about finance and to understand
why the GameStop event was so unique. So
the main question that I'm trying to
answer was does the GME short squeeze
represent a violation of market
efficiency or can the price enemies be
explained with EMH model plus behavioral
finance frameworks? To explore this, I
asked several practical questions and
first was a statement was is the claim
that GME traded at 4 cents in August
2020. How quickly markets incorporate
major events
did rationale risk adjusted
X anti-profit opportunities exist and
what did behavioral biases contribute
and which EMH forms were violated?
So to perform this analysis, I had to
gather the right data. This includes the
GameStop prices from August 20, the
squeeze, trading volume data, short
interest percentage to understand how
heavily the stock was being bet against,
and the spy index data so I could
compare the stock's moments against the
over market. I also needed to identify
all major events dates using new sources
such as when uh Brian Cohen increases
stake or when Wall Street u activity
started to spike and when trading
restrictions uh began to appear.
And all this is essential because
efficiency testing depends on knowing
exactly what information that the market
had at the time and when they had it and
how they used it.
So, one of the first things we were told
to check was the claim that GameStop
traded at since August 2020 using Python
and Yahoo Finance which is essentially
just using Python to get Yahoo Finance
data. I downloaded the actual price data
for the month and found that the stock
traded between $1 and two to $2 and not
just 4 cents. And this is extremely
important because if your analysis
starts with bad information, everything
just begins to become unreliable. So the
facteing just ensures that I'm working
with accurate data. And as you can see
here, the graph shows exactly what I'm
talking about. So you can see that
at the highest it was trading at a
dollar and at the lowest it was trading
at a dollar. So it never once broke down
to around 4 cents.
So now that I had the data, I moved on
to the represent stage. And here I laid
the event study framework I would use to
test market efficiency. An event study
basically looks at returns before,
during and after key event to see
whether prices adjust immediately or
approximately. I use the 10 days before
the event the event day itself and 10
days after. If the market is efficiency,
especially in the semi strong sense,
most of the price should happen on the
event day. If prices kept drifting up at
the event, that just suggests that the
market did not incorporate information
quickly, which might be pointing to
inefficiency.
and the EMH test we can see that a weak
form will test for productivity semi-
strong form is test the speed of the
reaction to public news and the strong
form will just examine private
information signals
so now keeping into the represent stage
and before I can measure whether games
behaved unusually during the short
squeeze I first need a baseline in other
words I need a model that tells me what
games should have returned on the normal
day and based on the market movements to
To build this baseline, I use something
called the CAPM model. CAPM basically
says that a stock's daily returns
depends on two things which is the alpha
and for those of you who don't know is
essentially the stock the stock's
average performance unrelated to the
market and beta which tells us how
sensitive the stock is to the overall
market movements. To get the values, I
downloaded daily returns for both
GameStop and the S&P 500 and then ran a
simple linear regression in Python. In
my results, Python estimated Games beta
at around -15, which is massively
negative. And this means that during
this short squeeze period, Gamestop was
not behaving like a typical stock at
all. Instead, it was moving slightly
with the market and it was moving in the
opposite direction and with extreme
movement. This regression also gave me
alpha, which is GameStop's average daily
return after removing market effects.
And once I have have alpha and beta, I
can comput's expected return for each
day. And the formula on the slide shows
that expected return equals alpha plus
beta times the market return. And this
is expected return.
And this expected return is crucial
because it lets me calculate abnormal
returns. Basically, the portion of
GameStop's movement that cannot be
explained by normal market behavior.
Without this step, I would have no way
of knowing whether GameStop's surge was
genuinely unusual or whether it was
simply moving in line with market
conditions. So this CAPM regression is
the mathematical foundation that makes
the entire event study possible.
So now we come to implementation.
So using the alpha betas I calculated I
got the expected return for the day and
then I subtracted from the actual return
to get abnormal return which tells me
how much of the movement cannot be
explained by the over market. When I
cumulative sum these abnormal returns, I
get CAR or in other words, cumulative
abnormal returns. And this is one of
important measures in event because it
tells me whether the price drifted in a
way that violates efficiency. And as you
can see here
in my graph,
you can see that there was unusual
movement during this time.
So when I plotted the trading volume
during the squeeze, the spikes were
massive. And sometimes, as you can see
here, it jumped more than 10 times the
normal activity. And large volume spikes
usually reflect hurting behavior. And
you know, this is really something that
you would expect during the GameStop.
What happened with the GameStop stock at
that time was actually unexpected. I
remember when that was going on in my
own personal life and how I was thinking
to myself that I should hop into this
and that I should buy in now. But, you
know, this is really again just goes to
show that this information that I'm
showing here is actually very valid and
it's something that I've been going
through myself where I almost feel like
I'm missing out and I need to get into
it. And again, this again what was going
on with GameStop at the time is shown
through these large volume spikes. And
it's just basically a lot of people pile
into the stock just because others are
doing it. And it often means that
investors are not making decisions based
on fundamentals but based on emotion,
hype, or social pleasure.
And this is a clear sign that behavioral
forces were at play. And I can myself
attest to that.
So I looked at short interest next. So
short interest shows the percentage of
shares being borrowed and sold by people
betting the stock would fall. GameStop
short interest reached around 140% of
the available shares. And this just
means that the shares were shorted than
um that more shares were shorted than
actual existed in the market. And
when the buying pressure suddenly
increased, short sellers were forced to
buy shares to cover their positions
which pushed the price even higher. And
this is just an example of what we call
um
this is just an example where even
sophisticated investors can't correct
mispricing because the risk are just too
high.
So to check whether the normal returns
were meaningful, I ran a statistical
test comparing the normal returns to
zero and the results showed that normal
returns were significantly positive
during the squeeze, meaning they were
not random noise. I also looked at
whether the prices drifted after the
event day and it did which shows that
the market did not incorporate
information immediately and this just
helps to build a case that semi strong
efficiency was violated.
So to make sure that the results were
independent on the exact model dates I
used. I ran several robust checks and
first I just compared my estimated betas
to values published by outside financial
resources
and second I tested multiple different
estimation windows. So 30 days, 60 days
and 90 days and the cumulative abnormal
returns were similar each time. And
third, I tried to um use alternate
models like the FMA French um three
factor model and the Carheart momentum
model. And even with these advanced
results, GameStop still showed large
abnormal returns. And finally, I just
checked um the look ahead and the um to
just make sure that I wasn't
accidentally using information that
investors wouldn't have had at the time.
And all these validation steps make the
findings more reliable.
So what does this all mean for real
world investing? So the main takeaway is
that prices are mostly efficient most of
the time. Prices reflect available
information, but behavioral dynamics can
create temporary mispricing, especially
during moments of hyper panic. For most
people, the best approach is a barbell
strategy. Keep around 80 to 90% of your
portfolio and passive index funds, which
rely on long-term efficiency of the
market, and then just use 10 to 20% for
selective active bets only when you have
a strong understanding of the situation.
And it's just a way to balance safety
with opportunity.
So finally reflecting on this project,
my personal investment philosophy has
become clear. Markets do a good job at
pricing assets most of the time, which
is why passive investing works so well.
But events like GME show that prices can
sometimes detach from fundamentals due
to human behavior, emotion, and
structural limitations. From GameStop, I
learned the importance of understanding
investor psychology, respecting how
risky markets can become, avoiding
hindsight bias when looking at dramatic
price moves, and just never confusing
short-term luck with actual skill.
Overall, I now see markets as mostly
efficient, but you know, occasionally
irrational, just like with many things
in life. And successful investing
requires recognizing which environment
you're in. Thank you so much for
listening, and I hope you enjoyed.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Kyle Sandwell. This is
the session uh eight
assignment for
man management 310. So what we have to
do is that we're investigating the
market efficiency using the GameStop
short speed event from 2020 to 2021 as a
case study. We're going to verify the
accuracy of the stated fast analyze the
price behavior of efficient market
hypothesis predictions. evaluate whether
market anomalies constitute ev evidence
against market efficiency or can be
explained with existing frameworks. So
starting off the first thing we got to
do
get the define the objective is to
investigate market efficiency of the
short squeeze and we want to the core
task we have are the to verify all
factual data points from the prompt
analyze gametop price behavior relative
to the effective marketing hypothesis or
EHM EMH. We want to test uh which form
of EMH were violated, evaluate
behavioral finance explanations for the
anomaly and assess if rational
systematic profits was possible.
Some research um the question was was
the GameStop short squeeze a complete
failure of the effective market
hypothesis or can be explained by modern
financial theory. This is the primary
objective is to test which forms of the
EMH were weak, semi- strong and strong.
These are the three types. which one
were violated by the GM by the GameStop
event. And some secondary objectives
would be uh quantify how abnormal the
event was. Using the abnormal returns
calculations, I defined the specific
behavioral biases that drove the price
hurting or overconfidence, evaluate the
market self-correct, and determine if
rational investors could have
systematically profited before the
event.
So, some known information, the peak
price of GameStop was $483 at January in
January 2021. the true value. Um,
analyst fundamental estimates were $10
to $40. Like that's what it was actually
should have been worth instead of this
inflated peak price of $483.
The spark um the short interest peaked
at a mathematically impossible 140% of
float. So it was 140% over what it was
actually worth.
And some key players in the event, Ryan
Cohen, he was supporting it. Uh the
Reddit page r/wall bets, they really
made it explode to this level. they
talked about it and planned this whole
thing. Basically, Melon Capital, they
lost 53% and then Robin Hood restricted
trading.
Some unknowns is what GameStop's normal
risk profile before the squeeze began.
Uh what were the exact dates of key
public announcements needed for our
event study? What was the daily abnormal
return during the squeeze? And can we
statistically prove that these returns
were not just random luck? So, some
verified data. The urgent claim was that
GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August
2020.
And this is fashion incorrect. GameStop
executed a 4 for one stock split in July
2022.
Um, historical data must be just for the
split. The split adjusted low for
GameStop in August 2020 was $1.67. The
pre-split real low price was $6.68.
This was fact checked by just simply
googling what the GameStop stock price
was in August 2020 and reading the Yahoo
Finance results. Uh, this is noted for
the future project. So basically what
that means is that the this number we
were given is not true. It's almost $2
off which is a huge discrepancy and it
could have affected it if we didn't
figure that out and fact check it.
So information we downloaded GameStop
daily stock prices and volume the S&P
500 daily price and the US T bill rate.
We use the S&P 500 as our market
benchmark and the T bills are risk-free
rate. Um, we use the normal time from
August 2020 to October 2020 to calculate
the GameStop's normal behavior. Then we
use the crazy time of December 2020 to
March 2021 to capture the events the
entire squeeze event. So test one uh the
question, can you use past prices to
predict future prices? EMH says no. Our
test will check if GameStop's return on
one day predicted its return on the
next. Calculation we made would be
return today equals alpha plus beta
times the return yesterday. What we'll
find is that during the squeeze beta
will be positive and significant. This
shows momentum and hurting order driving
prices and was not random chance.
Conclusion the weak form was violated.
Test two semi- strong form. The question
was do price reflect all public
information accuracy? M EMH says yes it
does.
Um this is the easy way. It says there's
two ways. The easy way is that public
info like the anal report says that
GameStop was worth $10 to $40 but the
market price hit $483. So therefore the
price was not correct. Then the event
study way would be that we calculated
the abnormal returns or AR. This is the
surprise profit that can be explained by
the market movement. So basically uh we
calculate it first. We calculate the
expected return using expected return
equals risk-free rate plus beta time
market return minus risk-free rate. Then
we find the AR which is AR equals actual
GameStop return minus the expected
return. Then we find the cumulative
abnormal return rate or car which is car
equals
um actual return day one plus actual day
actual return day two and so on so
forth.
We then will plot the car in efficient
market the line should be flat at zero.
So y axis x axis it should be just
straight across on the x axis no going
up or down. Um ours will look like a
giant mountain peak. So it will just go
up and down and up and down visually
proving the market was not efficient. So
therefore the semi-strong test was also
violated.
Test three, the question was can anyone
even sus beat the market? EMH says no.
Our test we looked at Melvin Capital and
they had a private sophisticated
analysis that GameStop was overvalued.
They shorted it and lost 53% of their
money. We're crying a bailout. Their
smart info was not was useless and uh
the strong form was violated because
they weren't able to beat the market. So
the results of this would be uh there's
some behavioral biases will show the
data was driven by human psychology and
not mathematics. Uh the car plots a
picture of a digital stampede from Wall
Street Bets. And then overconfidence
both retail traders thinking they'd all
get rich and hedge funds thinking their
short positions were foolproof or
overconfident.
Some moves to arbitrate.
Sorry, I don't know what that was.
some wins to arbit trade which is the
most important part would be uh the
question if GameStop was obviously
overpriced at $483.
Why didn't rational investors just short
it to bet on it being fall to bet on it
falling and bring the price back to
reality? The answer was they couldn't.
The arbitrage the correction was
blocked.
Um reason
one was that the short interest was
140%. There were no shares left to
borrow for shorting and the fees were
way too high to make it rational. Risk
two would be the risk the noise trader
risk the Reddit crowd noise traders
stayed irrational longer than Melvin
Capital the rational arbitrator could
stay solvent. Then reason three would be
the rules. Robin Hood restricted buying
this Robin Hood restricted buying. This
was a literal physical rule that stopped
the market from working. So you
literally could not buy GameStop at this
point. So to implement we ran uh some
Python code to find to prove test one
and two one and three I wasn't able to
put it onto the slide so I'll show you
in a little bit but for uh this is for
test two so the expected return beta
equals 1.85 made five. This is assumed
the uh return of GameStop would or the
actual return is up 92.7%.
So it's up almost 100% of what it
actually should be. S&P 500 return was
negative.015%.
Which is not that bad. And the receive
rate is zero. So the actual return rate
is RF plus beta times
uh
the sorry
return today and then return tomorrow
and this all equals to 0.275%.
And based on this it should have only
lost 28% that day. So it should not have
lost as much as it really did. Then the
abnormal or actual return is the actual
return minus the expected return and the
AR equals 93%. And his stock price had a
93% surprise return in a single day. In
general, 25% is very high. So this shows
it was a very high risk gamble instead
of investment. So people weren't
actually investing. They were more like
going to the casino and hoping it worked
out and just throwing money at it and
not actually using their brains to
actually invest smartly. Then to
validate this, we were able to
confidently say that our findings show
the GameStop event did produce a massive
normal return that can't be explained by
chance.
Then the issue um cap soon is a stable
beta. GameStop's beta risk profile was
not stable. It was going up and down, up
and down. It changed widely during the
during the squeeze. And in conclusion,
the fact our model's core assumption
breaks down is not a failure of our
analysis. It is further proof of the
anomaly. It confirms the market was
behavioral rational outside the bounds
of normal risk models
to evolve. Um we got some action versus
passive. This event strongly supports
passive investing. A passive index fund
would have minimal or no exposure
protecting investors from this
idioscentric
volatality. Active managers who shorted
GameStop like Melbourne Capital were
destroyed while those who chased the
high price bought at the peak. Risk
management. Uh the key lesson is not
about fundamentals but about risk
management. The event demonstrates the
danger of overleveraged short positions
and introduced a new risk factor. Social
media has driven her behavior. So really
all that's saying is that uh it was
overleveraged for short positions. So
people betting on it fall had the
advantage. So it wasn't really worth
buying and the herd of the social media
Reddit page drove the price up even
more. This new framework for hedge fund
managers. This event proves the
fundamental analysis alone is
insufficient. You must now also monitor
the limits to arbitrary factors like
short interaction interest at percent of
float borrow cost and social media
sentiment as a key factor. So basically
for hedge manager they have more stuff
to pay attention to and more potential
factors that could affect their
investments.
Then to reflect um the EMH versus
behavioral the GameStop event does not
disprove the EMH. said it serves as the
ultimate real world example of limits to
arbitrage, a key component of modern
financial theory. Synthesis, the market
is not efficient in the perfect
theoretical sense is a competitive
environment where behavioral biases like
hurting or overconfidence can create a
massive temporary dislocation or
bubbles. These dislocations can persist
precisely because the risk and cost of
rational arbitrage
like shorting this bubble are way too
high. Then final answer, the GameStop
event is a clear violation of weak form
and semi-strong form efficiency is not
evidence against the market efficiency
theory, but rather a powerful validation
of the behavioral finance framework and
the limits to arbitration concept, which
together explained why such anomalies
can exist. So we're going to move over
here. Um, this is my Gemini stuff. It
took me a while. Honestly, it's the most
it's taken me to get to say multiple
prompts and get the actual answers I
wanted. Like you can see uh my represent
was not very good. So I had to get more
information. My it was making too many
words or it's not concise. Uh wanted it
to be organized
some more stuff. Then all the way down
here I had a lot of issues with my code
honestly. So I had to ask it over and
over again on how to fix it. But
eventually it gave me this code.
This is just uh the stuff it needs to
see. And over here you can see the
returns the S&P 500 and the daily
returns. The GameStop returns is
extremely volatile. It's like super high
positive then kind of then drops
negative then even more negative then
shoots back up. While these are both
extremely steady compared to that. Then
over here the calculated beta of normal
time would be 1.6 and the calculated
alpha would be 017.
Then all the way over here you can see
again GameStop was super volatile
compared to the other thing items.
Um this calculated the example or this
calculated the actual return which is
extremely high compared to everything
else. Again proving its fluctuation.
Then uh this just proves that the p
value is too big and we can't reject the
hypothesis. That's some more status
stuff. Then these graphs show the huge
mountain peak I I mentioned earlier in
the data. You can see it's relatively on
zero. Then it shoots up then back down
and shoots up again. Shoots up then back
down then up and then back up and then
up and then. So really that just shows
the volatility of it. Thank you for your",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"so this task is to analyze the 2020 to 2021 GameStop short squeeze using the DRIVER framework and of course the KISS method to study market efficiency in behavioral finance.

So to start with the video—the Define stage—just like I said, I want to see if markets always reflect all available information like the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) says, or if investor behavior, emotion, and social media can cause major price swings. I will be using the DRIVER framework to keep everything simple and focused and help me keep track of what I'm getting.

So to Represent the stage, I planned out how to collect and show my data. I used the Y-Finance library in Python along with Gemini to pull real GameStop price data from late 2020 to 2021. This gives the actual historical numbers, which you can see right here. I like my graphs and tables to see the numbers—it helps me better understand what I'm looking at.

I also used a simple return formula, which is R = (P1 – P0) / P0, to measure how much the stock price changed over time. That helps me identify abnormal returns that might not match normal market behavior. As you can see in the tables here, these numbers from the dates give a clearer view of what happened during the short squeeze period.

For the Implement stage, I created one clear graph to help me understand GameStop's closing prices. You can see that prices stayed low for most of 2020 but spiked sharply at the beginning of 2021, which I found pretty interesting, before slowly dropping again—but still staying higher compared to 2020. That visual shows the short squeeze and the volatility that made this event so famous. It's a simple but powerful way to capture how extreme investor reactions can look in data.

The analysis of GME's price movement relates to the weak form of EMH. The weak form states that future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing past or historical data. Based on the visual, I looked at whether the price behavior observed is consistent with each form of EMH. Gemini provided the analyses, which helped me understand and implement the data pulled.

Here I compared what I saw in the graph to the three forms of EMH—weak, semi-strong, and strong. The GameStop surge clearly broke from what the EMH would predict. Public information didn't justify that kind of price jump, so this event doesn't fit the semi-strong or strong forms of efficiency. It shows that markets can behave irrationally when emotions and group behavior take over, which you can clearly see in the data.

It's really interesting to see this on a graph and table because it's one thing to read about it online, but another to actually see how the numbers were affected. For the Evolve stage, I looked at why this happened. Behavioral finance helps explain it—especially herding, FOMO, and overconfidence. Social media platforms like Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok amplified these effects and encouraged mass buying, which caused rapid price movements. This shows how human behavior and communication can strongly influence short-term market movements, even when fundamentals don't change.

That happens every day—even I've seen things online that make me want to invest in something trending. For the Reflect stage, I summarized what I learned: online human behavior can influence investing decisions. This project taught me that markets are not always perfectly efficient—they're made up of people, and people act emotionally, even myself.

By using the DRIVER framework, I stayed organized and moved step-by-step through defining, analyzing, and interpreting the data. Using Gemini helped simplify the process and provided tables showing price, close, high, low, open, and volume numbers with corresponding dates. The tables really helped me most—I could see how the numbers from early 2020 instantly spiked in 2021, which is pretty accurate when you think about how social media triggers FOMO and emotional investing.

One key takeaway is that real markets are shaped by both information and human behavior. My summary is that I collected GME price data for 2020 to 2021 with no missing values. The price visualization clearly shows dramatic volatility during the short squeeze. The GME short squeeze significantly challenges the semi-strong and strong forms of EMH, as the movement was driven by social media sentiment and coordinated retail activity rather than intrinsic value or public/private information.

Key behavioral finance factors included herding behavior, overconfidence, availability bias, and FOMO. These created a feedback loop that collectively drove extreme price movements, as shown in the data. For future research, one could quantify the correlation between social media activity on platforms like Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok and GME's price movements to better understand behavioral impacts.

Overall, this assignment showed me that combining financial theory with behavioral insights gives a more realistic view of how markets actually trade. So yeah—thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Dylan Sheiel and this is my management 310 session 8 assignment. We are talking about market efficiency hypothesis and doing some investigation with that. I first off need to say I'm sorry in advance. I am deathly ill. And so if I get brain fog or I am a little confused or maybe I don't go into as much depth as I should on this assignment, I apologize, but I I tried very hard, but I've had to miss the last couple of classes due to being so sick. So, but we'll get into this and we're going to try our best and try to rally. So first off uh the goal of the assignment is we are going to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2021 as a case study. So this is one of the most notorious um I guess market abnormalities of all time or at least definitely in recent time for somebody growing up like me. I was in high school during this um and I was reading on the news and it was just very confusing. It was um I obviously at the time didn't really know what was going on, but everyone was saying that it was it was abnormal and it was different and we had no clue why at the time and now we kind of have some some ideas of how that could have happened and um but we will uh we'll we'll get into why and how that happened. So the first step of this is we want to verify the statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 against actual uh historical data and use the event timeline given in August 2020 GameStop was near bankruptcy levels then the tree founder acquired 13% stake and then it rose and we'll get into all these things as we go but so for the prompt I said first thing I said is hi I am a financial accounting student learning about market efficiency and this week I plan to use GameStop short squeeze event in of 2021. I know that this is one of the most abnormal market changes in history and today I want you to help me explore why that is. I first want to verify the information I believe I know that the real world information from the real data which I know to be true market data which cannot be messed or changed. I then want to test which from which form of market efficiency was being violated. My first thought would be semi- strong as it seemed to have there had been some major insider info being passed that the public did not know. But it's important with the semi strong that there was still um all market data being able to be used. I then want to check if I as a rational investor could have profited systematically from this surge. Lastly, I want to compare market efficiency hypothesis predictions to observe data and assess behavior finance uh explanations for abnormalities we see. for the anomalies we see. Sorry. I said I want you to act as a financial accounting professor with a vast knowledge in Python coding as well as market efficiency and market history. And then important thing I said when using Python as a tool, please keep the code clean, organized, and beginner friendly. This just makes it easy to digest. And then I told it I I wrote out my goals. I said to complete the goals, I want you to first want you to create a simple Python code that imports the real data from the 2021 uh 2020 and 2021 short squeeze of GameStop and uh verify that the stock price of GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. I then want to use this info to do a market efficiency testing which includes classifying the event relative to the efficient market hypothesis forms which are weak, semi- strong and strong and then do an evaluation of abnormal returns during the event and lastly do an assessment of predictability patterns. I then want you to create a simple yet effective sensitivity table to show rational investor analysis to show if the average Joe like me who is riskaverse could have profited during this event. this and then I said this information should all come from the real data that you import using panda software. Please keep the clip code clean, organized and beginner friendly. So we go into my collab and the first thing it did is it imported to pandas. It imported mat lab mattplot just to um show these things and then um an important thing that we had was um it shows that the prices are adjusted for or split adjusted because there was a 4:1 split. So the stock prices were divided by four and if we see in August of 2020 um our stock price was a dollar to a$150. It was a it was this was before the split of 4 to $6. And so the first thing we see is that we um this information that we thought we had the GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 20 was um we I believe that's wrong. Um it looks like as we can see that it was actually trading in a dollar and I think the reason this um misinformation could have came was potentially we were looking at the we thought that that had been split already the 4 to1 stock split but it actually hadn't yet that stock that came in 2022 I believe and so it actually was trading at a dollar at the time and then um so this is just it um it uh showing the stock split and stuff. And so, um, I, um, was wrong in my, um, efficient market hypothesis and why it was being violated. Um, the, uh, the I was correct that it was a semi strong form violation, but I was actually wrong in the reasoning. So, I had said it was insider info, but the insider information was not the primary driver. information during the squeeze um driving the squeeze was an 140% short interest in the Reddit coordination which we actually had in the key points here that it was primarily driven by Reddit and it peaked at an 140% of uh float and it's technically was publicly available um but the prices weren't adjusted to this and that is where the uh market efficiency uh died. the market ignored the short squeeze and then everyone um violently overreacted. We can see there's actually a graph in here that uh did not input. Where is it at? Let me try and find it. We can see this graph and we can see here um this puts us into 2021 and we have this in this area right here is where we would have started to see that information become prevalent. But then it quickly skyrocketed. we saw that this is where the overreaction came and this is where people finally started to realize the issue and that's when it got pushed up. And so the next thing I wanted to do was create a sensitivity table to see if I as an average Joe could have um invested. And here we are. And no, the answer is no. Uh systematically at least. Um, as you can see, the returns are incredibly different than anyone could have thought they would have been, could have guessed they would have been. And as an average Joe who's risk averse and trying to make sure that they do what's best and trade at a normal rate and um basically it's it was impossible here because the um the surge and the price skyrocketing was had no real rhyme or reason to how it happened. We saw that um a lot of it came from this hedge fund that needed to be fixed. And so on Wall Street, these people drove up the prices at random times and in coordination from a uh Reddit group. It's in here somewhere. It's in here somewhere. I'm so I'm sorry. But um it is um Oh, here we go. The anomaly came from uh following the Reddit crowd. It it's it's called hurting is one of the uh anomaly uh things which is the behavioral finance explanation. It's called hurting which basically means that everyone follows a small path and that came from I believe the right was called Wall Street Bets and so everyone herded together and rose the stock up and yes technically uh you could have followed this but I in my opinion as an average Joe as a rational investor that's not something you would do that's not systematic in any way and that's the answer we're uh trying to trying to see is could it you have profited systematically the answer is no you can that is not systematic. um systematic would be trading normally and trading with a pattern and this there was no pattern to this and so um I was correct that it was semi- strong but I was wrong in the reason it was it was there there there was public information it was given it's just the public information was treated abnormally and that was due to hurting and so the market efficiency was um was faulted in that that and then the market efficiency predictions were also violated in this because as you can see the abnormal surge we went from in August we were selling at a dollar a share and then at the turn of the new year in January we shot up to $4 a share and that is incredibly unheard of and then by the end of that month we were at $19 a share and that is so abnormal nothing could have uh no market efficiency could have uh predicted that and again that goes to the abnormality of hurting and um how people drove this up together. This was a coordinated effort that um the average Joe could not have could not have went to. We see that by the sensitivity table. This is not systematic in any way. And um so yeah, I overall the first thing we look at is we were we one we were wrong in the um idea that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. That is not correct. It was actually a dollar and that's okay. Again, I think there was just some issues with the uh idea of the stock split that came later in life. And so I think there was some confusing there. And um so yeah, and then as we can see from this graph here, there is so many abnormalities. It rose, it skyrocketed up and then it came slightly down and then it rose right back up. And that again is due to the abnormalities that the market efficiency could not have um could not have happened. And the company did look like it was going bankrupt in 2020. This is goes a lot to the idea of the um the market model in 2020. Everyone was stuck at home in COVID. You couldn't go out and buy games. And so the idea of GameStop shifted uh almost became obsolete because of everyone was buying their games online through Microsoft or through Sony or through Steam. And so um GameStop's um GameStop's what's the word? Um like their their model became obsolete and so it almost went bankrupt. But then but then these these uh these men uh Ryan Cohan and the hedge fund they they saw an opportunity to make money and drive it back up and that's what happened. And so one of the things I learned most from this was that the this idea of not necessarily insider training because I guess as we see it isn't what it was but it was a coordinated effort by people not normal people with ideas and people with the the ability to push things up and they were able to do that. And so as an average Joe that's not something you can really find yourself in. And so it was very interesting because these things can happen in the market and they are very abnormal. And so it was kind of the aha moment in this thing was it happened and there's still to this day not really an explanation for it but that's how it happened. And so as I reflect on this, it's it's very interesting to see as somebody who is trying to get into the market as I get older and in my career as an actuary, I will look at market fluctuations a lot and have to deal with them mostly in the health insurance field, but still um it's very interesting to see and to be able to know that some of these things are out of the control of normal people, of the average Joe, of the normal investors, people that don't have pole and that's a little scary. Um, but that's also something that um I hope that in the future I can be a part of and be able to learn from. So yeah, that's my that's my uh session assignment. Thank you again. I'm very sorry for being sick. Please give me some grace on this. I am I am trying my best today. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Session 8 covered market efficiency and behavioral finance. Uh more specifically the efficient market hypothesis or EMH. Uh for the define and discover part uh we wanted to investigate the market efficiency using the GameStop and short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. Ultimately, we wanted to understand if market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or if these anomalies could be better explained with other frameworks um or if the market anomalies could be explained within existing frameworks. Um so part of this what happened understanding um what even happened during this essentially Gamestock had a bunch of stockholders uh that would borrow stocks and then sell them to a third party for a higher price hoping to get a payout once they rebuy them and then sell them back to GameStop. Um, all this back and forth resulted in a drastic increase of price as well as um the the the more important thing the the selling of more stock than actually existed which is the concept of being shortstocked is not having enough stocks to actually go around. Um, and then the second part of the define and discover section was verifying the historical data. Um the first thing I noticed was that uh the GameStop traded at 4 cents in August, but according to uh Google Finance, um the stocks were actually about $14. Um, and then I did find that the short interest peaked at about 140% of float, which basically means that there was 140% of the stock was not actually associated to anybody. Um, and then retail trading volume increased 10fold. It was actually it increased 15fold. um it was just being overturned so quickly that it was actually uh 1500% what was originally there. So that's a increase of 15% 15 fold during the squeeze um trading restrictions implemented at peak for example Robin Hood. So yes, I did find a source that uh during all of this um although brokerage firms such as Robin Hood were really hesitant to uh help out and like lend money uh without like very substantial collateral. So with something like this happening, nobody knows where their money is really at because of all this back and forth and not really truly knowing the price. So brokerage firms like Robin Hood had really heavy restrictions. And then the hedge fund um sustained 53% required bailout 53% which required bailout was also true. um it was just a drastic shock in the market and they needed to be bailed out because of that because of the the shorts stock situation that I explained above. Um and then lastly, the analyst fundamental value estimates $10 to $40 per share. Um as of today, it's about $21 per share. The past week or so, it's been about $20 20 $21 per share. Um, so with all of that in mind, figuring out how to analyze the different uh market efficiencies, moving on to the represent section, I first wanted to make a timeline. Um, so in general, in August 2020, GameStop is near bankruptcy levels. Um and then September 2020, uh a different company founder acquires 13% stake. So he essentially buys 13% of this company of GameStop of GME. And then by January 2021, all of the Reddit chains, all of social media is um making some crazy claims and the price surges to $483. Um, and this was also fact checked in the the data here too. Um, so then by February 2021, the congressional hearings on market manipulation occurred and sort of reevaluated. They implemented some other things, got some brokerage firms into place. And so now we're postvent, everything is stabilized. Life's good now. Um, so just having that general timeline of nothing and then they had a little bit of money and then all of a sudden the stocks went crazy so it went really high up and then the congressional sort of started to bring it back down and now we're nice and stable for several years. Um and then things I wanted to look at for efficiency benchmarks comparing different types of efficiencies. For strong efficiency, um ignore ignore those words. For strong efficiency, you want to look at um if all of the prices reflected everything you know, including the things you don't know. um in practice it's ideal but in reality it's a lot more complex uh but we wanted to measure that anyways and then uh for semi strong efficiency um that incorporates all publicly available information um and that primarily uses technical analysis rather than fundamental or insider trading information. Um and then for the weak efficiency, the weak form uh of efficiency, we want to see um how prices we the week efficiency measures um all past data and volume information. Uh it's basically like the core business like the basic fundamental analysis that we've worked on in the first couple of sessions. Um using like company data and uh like the

um using different financial statements, the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement uh and just looking at those. So if we can get a lot of information from that and understand that's like what the weak efficiency benchmark uses. Um and then to understand the return analysis of GameStop um we're using concepts from CAPM the capital asset pricing model as well as from this unit. So for normal return I used a formula from uh this section which was alpha plus beta times the market return. Um and alpha is just the excess return and then beta is the market sensitivity. Um so if that's positive that means you're getting extra money. You are it's a the market is returning more money than you put into it. If it's negative then you're losing money in the market. Uh and then the abnormal return would be the actual return minus the normal return um or the expected return. Those are sort of interchangeable in this situation. Um and the expected return jumping back to CAPM would be the uh the risk-free rate plus the beta times market risk premium. Um so that carries over into this section as well. And then the cumulative abnormal return is just the sum of all the abnormal returns. So that's a helpful tool to look at for if you're looking at like a portfolio of companies that you're looking to invest in. Moving on to the implement stage um to test the market efficiency and find which ones are violated and to evaluate if investors can actually be profitable in this system. Uh I built this code um with some AI assistance. Uh but this is my code. So here it's setting up to run simulations for different events. um because obviously we're not in 2020 anymore, but we do have that data. So, we're establishing the risk-free rate here and then the market rate, the market return here, and then the um GameStop returns here. And then we plug the variables in to our equations that I explained above. Um and then simulating the periods starting in January and going through February and March. Um it breaks down and calculates all the different betas. And um it also calculates our um risk our expected risk and our abnormal return um given the scenarios. So at first at the very beginning of January the abnormal return is relatively low. By mid January it is almost at four uh which is the peak of it. Um, and then by the end of January 2021, it is back down to under one, which is much better uh, as far as a company goes because this level at four basically means that um, GameStop is undervalued and they are losing money versus the uh, investors are um yeah, the investors are gaining a ridiculous amount of money for their investment, but this quick turnaround is also a sign that something's going on here. This isn't right. So over the course of the month, the mean abnormal return was 1.35. Um and from this data we can conclude that the market efficiency um we can conclude that there's a massive violation in the semi strong form of the EMH uh the efficient market hypothesis um because there's a lot of different stuff happening and it is not able to uh use all of the available information um in a positive way. So we can break down the violations here um to validate some of this data um we can see that um abnormal returns uh it there's a huge positive abnormal return but it can't really be explained by beta or fundamental public information. Um so that's sort of a red flag for us. And then the weak form of the EM is violated because the price movement uh is showing that it's highly profitable when it shouldn't be which is a violation for the weak form. Um you should be able to follow a pattern for market market trends and uh as GameStop since GameStop is just like a small it's it's a company that runs out of a strip mall. It shouldn't be a crazy profitable model. It it's it's a business that's been in place for a long time. Um, so the weak form is likely violated here. And then the semi- strong form as I previously mentioned is definitely violated um because of the price differences from the estimated like $20 from earlier versus the peak price of $483. Um that's suggesting that the prices are not being reflected by public knowledge and information. Um so then how does this apply to behavioral biases and behavioral finance? Um because of the situation of what it was uh there was definitely a lot of hurting happening in this situation. Um people started talking on Reddit a social media and then everybody started taking advantage of this situation that was being happened uh with GameStop. Um and then there was also some overconfidence happening. People were being investing in things when they maybe they shouldn't have. Um they were definitely anchoring and it's part of their uh they heard one thing and they just went with it. Um as well as there's also some market anomalies happening here too. we can see a calendar effect where there's just a peak in one just like one period of time, one week where there's this crazy high rate. Um, we're also seeing some momentum happening where one person starts doing it and makes money and so then a bunch of people start doing and make money. Uh, and that sort of comes back to the the hurting of everyone is doing it, everyone is playing the game and gambling a little bit. Um so to validate some of this stuff uh the abnormal returns are statistically different from zero. We can see that with the 1.35 it is much larger than zero. Um so we know that this is definitely something that is abnormal. Um profits are profits large enough to overcome transaction costs? Well, maybe at the start, but as time went on and people were taking a bigger and bigger risk, those profits that they were hoping to make were a lot less. So, economically speaking, this is probably not true. Um, and then persistence. How does the pattern continue after become after it becomes widely known? Well, if we look at the data, you can see the huge giant spike from before the incident, before the short squeeze happened, and then this tall spike right here is the short squeeze. Um, and after that, it slowly makes its way back down to recover and then it starts to settle back in and stabilize over the past couple years. Um, so to answer the question, no, the pattern does not continue. Um and then are abnormal rates compensation for additional risk to a certain extent? Yes. Um if alpha is positive then the uh abnormal return will be positive and you are gaining excess returns. However, if the abnormal return is negative that means you are losing money. So um you're it's another level of risk. It's not necessarily compensation for risk. And then to evolve this a little bit more um taking this and evolving it to another stage. Uh you can look at different markets public versus private thinking public stocks versus private investment funds like 401ks. um different measures of units and comparing the risk there. You can take the concepts of the EMH uh the efficient market hypothesis and seeing how that um comes into effect with different things like the banks versus stocks like this and comparing those risk levels. Um other implications will include um the behavioral finance framework. So comparing the EMH with uh like the the hurting and the overconfidence um and like how those play a role in this hypothesis testing. Uh as we can sort of see from earlier uh people will follow each other like the hurting. Uh however if you take into account loss aversion you don't want to um make as people are risk averse so they will run away from risk if they can so they're less likely to invest that's one possible implication of the EMH um and then acute versus or active versus passive management um the effect the efficient market hypothesis definitely uh takes a more active role. If you want to be a more passive, then you're going to be less risky and you probably won't be in stocks that this would happen. Um so it's definitely a mentality thing, behavioral thing. And then uh market efficiency policy. So um as previously mentioned after it went to Congress and they established higher um or they established some new boundaries for this um the actions of doing the the short squeezing and short stocking and borrowing stocks to then sell them and then resell them and reby them. That is now illegal. The insider trading is now illegal. Um, and then something else to continue evolving to evolve this a little bit more would be to use different measures of efficiency such as the adaptive market hypothesis. Um, that's even more active and it is a way of uh setting the grounds for the future rather than looking at past data. Finally, to reflect on this whole assignment, we can use existing frameworks to understand market anomalies compared to the ideal market efficiency. These frameworks allow us to identify situations that exhibit the asset substitution problem and limits to arbitrage such as the GameStop short squeeze. However, it is also important to take into account the use of other hypotheses and compare compare them to EMH for a well-rounded sense of the market. And that's all I have.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"So for my session 8 assignment, uh I decided to do an investigation of the 2021 GameStop stock short squeeze. Once again, this presentation will be following the driver methodology. Define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect. Starting off by defining what what are our goals. We want to verify historical GameStop price data. We also want to test the efficient market hypothesis. The three forms of it, the weak, semi- strong and strong form. We want to run an event study style for analysis of abnormal returns. Basically, you want to see how off from the median or the benchmark being the S&P 500 were these returns based off pot. And then you want to examine behavioral finance factors behind the short squeeze. Why did it happen? How could these abnormal returns be justified? The event the short squeeze took place between August and fe and February 2021. Uh the data we're going to be using is GameStop price, GameStop volume of stocks bought and sold, and the S&P 500 as a benchmark. And then key events uh that have to do with this stock, and we're going to see how they affected the price from a behavioral standpoint, not from a financial standpoint was coen stake, the Robin Hood restrictions, and the hearings. So to set up a timeline for our present stage, first we want to verify the historical price data. Then we want to collect GameStop and benchmark returns. Estimate the CAPM pre-event window to get a a measure of the average regression bench beta and alpha for this uh stock. Compute abnormal returns. Compute the cumulative abnormal returns for the same dates and then interpret the efficient market hypothesis versus behavioral finance implications. Here we're going to be using different fi Python concepts. We're going to be using the Yahoo Finance library to get the historical data. Numpy, pandas, map plot lib, and a regression return calculation function as well as price and return variables. So starting off with the Python code we're implementing. First, we import the libraries. This block in particular imports libraries, formats the decimals, and removes scientific notation for floats. Then we download the data directly from Yahoo Finance. Here we can see the parameters we're lining up and then here we're using the yif to download directly from the Yahoo Finance API. Then we estimate the cap. Here we're running a regression from a pre-wind to calculate alpha and a beta have a a variable number for this formula. Then we compute the abnormal returns and the cumulative abnormal returns using as you can see here the alpha and the beta as a market constant and as a coefficient of market return. We create a cumulative abnormal returns for the event window. Then we plot it using the mattplot lib Python extension Python Python library. We create graphs for both and it will return the trading volume and display dramatic spikes. And then finally we create a summary table to use these numbers and relate them to the events that happen in real life like cohen stake the wall street bet spike the Robin Hood halt and hearings. So now we're validating here are the formulas in theory that we use. So we use a linear regression formula and we got these regression results. As you can see here the constant or the alpha was 0.0155 and then the coefficient for market return or the beta in this case was 1.7418. Here we can also we can see we got the error and other variables used in linear regression. Then here we use the abnormal return formula using the the ones the already previously defined alpha and beta and then the return from the GameStop baseline that we got from Yahoo Finance. We plotted these are abnormal returns. So not necessarily the price spikes but the price spikes above from what would be expected of the stock and the benchmark. And here we can see the trading volume during those days. And there is some aligning here. The 21st of January was this day. And then the amount of volume kept going up which could indicate this spike. And then the sell-off here at the end of it. And then we get this data table output. So we can see when Ryan Cohen reports a 10% stake, the price return is 2.93 and this is a normal uh by a 3.34%. And this is one of the most normal ones. But here uh during our calculated phase this one between the 1st the 5th of January and the 5th of February we can see that there are some much higher returns and much higher abnormal returns even going into 137% and - 47 abnormal returns which is incredibly high. This was at the peak price day pre-split and then Robin Hood restricts buying which is what causes var to sell off in fear. So how could we evolve this experiment or this analysis? In the first part we could test alternate event windows. As you can see the graphs were only for a month. We could use different different times. We can start from before extended. We could also alternate test alternate risk models not only using the capen formula maybe using WACC other ways of of measuring a benchmark and then of in therefore measuring how much the abnormal return expands upon and then we can expand behavioral indicators and then the efficiency mark the efficient market hypothesis analysis we can see it violates all three types of efficient market hypothesis theories. First one is that it cannot predict we cannot predict a market using past returns. In this case that is true because is is it is so abnormal that no previous returns would have matched what happened here since it wasn't due to market or or earnings report or financial data. Then the semi- strong uh hypothesis form is you cannot earn abnormal returns using public information. And once again in this case we can say that that is violated because the returns the abnormal returns wen't due to public information through financial data from the company. there was an abnormal returns but due to external factors. And then the final one is that we can't beat the market which is also violated because if you were to buy here and then sell here, you would have beat the market by a pretty large margin in all of these high price return days specifically. And then going a bit deeper into a a behavioral finance analysis, uh we can see this situation reflects hurting. It reflects following behind a clear message which was the hold. The whole cultural momentum of the hold and people not wanting to sell not because it was the best financial decision but because they were acting as a group. Then attentionbased training. uh people were learning uh many times how to invest for the first time, opening their first investment accounts and Robin Hood accounts from Wall Street Bets and from this creator. So they were just following what he said and acting as if he was right which also resulted in the third point which was overconfidence. Normally in a standard market behavior, if a stock were to go up that much over its price or its average calculated price price target, then people would have sold off, but they weren't because of this market behavior and this cultural phenomenon which was occurring. So basically my conclusion and my results of our analysis is that these sort of return and this sort of event wouldn't happen naturally due to financial data. No, it wasn't like GameStop was doing great financial moves. Instead, it was because of a cultural phenomenon and uh emotional attachment to the stock. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Derek Sites and this is
my session 8 homework assignment
submission. And let me just start off by
saying that the uh short squeeze for
GameStop back in 2021 is one of my
favorite just financial events of all
time. So, this was a really cool project
to get to work on. So for define and
discover, I want to test how well the
efficient market hypothesis explains the
21 or the 20 to 21 GameStop short
squeeze and whether observed anomalies
can instead be understood through
behavioral science and market structure
constraints. Before anything else, I
verified the August 2020 price and the
false claim was that it was4
and the actual pre-split price was
$6.68. 68.
So the split adjusted price was $167.
And this is actually what GameStop
traded for. And the research design, I
will use the event timeline and key
prices to create a simple parameterized
event study. And I'm going to encode it
in a Python script that accepts user
inputs or defaults. Always like usual.
This is how I always do it. Computes
basic returns and profit scenarios.
compares market prices to analyst value
ranges and it applies simple rule-based
logic to label possible EMH violations
and it's going to use the tool to
explore or we're going to use the tool
to explore how different assumptions
affect conclusions. So for represent to
move from raw facts to analysis I
represent the problem using three linked
frameworks the em so we're going to use
the weak form EMH where prices already
reflect all past prices/ last volumes
which means no profitable strategies
from momentum or short interest screens.
uh semi-strong EMH which is prices
instantly reflect all public info and
strong form EMH where prices reflect all
public info but nobody systematically
beats the market
and the total compute returns and price
gaps that feed into simple rules and I
will conceptually model the hurting/fear
of missing out this is all of the users
piling in and the confirmation bias or
the Reddit echo chamber on r/ /wall
street bets and overconfidence and
gambling or the yolo options where
everyone was trying to buy in all at
once and putting as much money as
possible into the options trading and
the limits to arbitrage. So the extreme
short interest plus margin risk and the
micro structure so clearing house
collateral jumps and Robin Hood buys.
So the actual collab itself, we have the
verification of the 2020 price as
described above where it was actually
trading at the $167 price mark. And here
are all the returns around like the most
important key events. So the board
announce or pre-event board announcement
is around 63%
from that $167.
And this is peak squeeze over 2,000%
jump from the bottom. And that's insane.
That's unheard of. And now we have the
postevent stabilization where it dipped
all the way down to below 90 almost 90%.
And the pre-event or the return
pre-event postvent which was 163.16%.
So comparison to an analyst bond values
um so the analyst value band is about
$10 to $30 and at peak market price that
$160 heaven hit upwards of $483
per share and the peak price is about 16
times above the top analyst estimate.
So the simple EMH assessment,
weak form EMH
goes through it. Semi-strong EMH again
discusses all of it. And strong form EMH
in practice, it rarely holds. And this
is all just stuff we've talked about
above. So the rational investor
profitability is the pre- peak gains
show big upside for early buyers, but
this required recognizing the squeeze
setup in advance. So being a part of
that r/wall street bets group. Um
surviving extreme volatility, selling
near the top. So being able to time that
time 16
point and just being able to realize
that that's going to be the peak and
shorting at the peak looks profitable in
hindsight but carried massive risk of
further spikes and margin call/force
liquidation. So there were large
potential profits but they were high
risk and not easily repeatable.
So validating even though the script is
intentionally simple I still validate
both the logic and the numeric. So
sanity checks with default GME inputs.
You put in 1943 or 48350
with that initial analyst band and the
script produces very high preak return.
So, it's over that 2,000% march with a
large drop peak post and peak price. And
that's the 10x analyst high. So,
rule-based assessment flags, strong semi
strong violations and likely weak form
violations
and these qualitative conclusions match
the detailed research narrative. So, the
conceptual validation.
So alternative scenarios by rerunning
this code over here and changing the
inputs. Um if we were to do if we were
to set the peak at 60 and the NS high
the script would have given us extreme
violations and conditions would fail
that 5x rule. Uh or we just do no
squeeze at all and the set short
interest to 20 and the volume to one and
script should not claim weak form
violation. Momentum isn't large enough.
So to evolve this, we could I could
evolve the project further by having the
Python code create a timeline of or a
timeline graph that mirrors the real
world data to show exactly where the
stock prices rise above that 2,000%.
And I could also implement a section
where I let the user simulate more
detailed paths well you buy at multiple
dates or staggering exits.
So reflecting uh building the KISS
Python tool helped me understand the
GameStop event more clearly because I
could see the price jumps and valuation
gaps and simple numbers. Translating EMH
concepts into code made me realize how
extreme the GME anomaly really was
compared to normal market behavior. And
running different inputs showed that
markets are usually efficient, but they
can break down when emotions, crowd
behavior, and trading constraints take
over. The project also taught me that
even rational strategies can become
dangerous when arbitrage is limited.
Overall, combining theory with a simple
programmable model made the entire event
easier to understand and explain. And
with that, that is my submission for
session 8.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi everyone, my name is Juan, and today I'm going to walk through what we covered in Session 8 by using the DRIVER framework. To make everything more concrete, I created a fictional company called NeuroLink Robotics to highlight how market efficiency and human behavior interact, especially when the price the market gives a stock is very different from the value we calculate.

So the question started when my model said NeuroLink Robotics should be worth around forty-two dollars per share, but the market was trading it at one hundred and sixty dollars. Seeing such a huge gap forced me to ask: am I missing something major? Is the market just too excited? Or is this one of those moments where emotions, trends, and hype distort the price? That tension between whether the market is right or whether investors are reacting emotionally is what Session 8 was all about, and DRIVER helped me structure my thinking around it.

To understand the situation, I first tried to simplify the Efficient Market Hypothesis using the ""Represent"" part of the method. The weak form basically says that past prices are already baked into the current price, so just reading charts shouldn't be enough to consistently beat the market. The semi-strong form says that public information—like earnings announcements—gets absorbed quickly, which means fundamental analysis shouldn't give you a long-term edge if the market is truly efficient. And the strong form claims that even private information is already reflected in prices, which we know is unrealistic. Rewriting EMH in plain English helped me figure out when the market tends to be right and where inefficiencies could show up.

Then I imagined an earnings announcement for NeuroLink Robotics to apply the ""Implement"" step of DRIVER. Before the news, the stock behaves normally. On the event day, new information suddenly enters the market. And after the event, we watch how fast or slow the price adjusts. In an efficient market, especially under the semi-strong form, most of the reaction should happen instantly on the event day. But if the price keeps drifting over the next few days, that suggests the market didn't fully react right away. Thinking about this event study helped me connect the theory from class to a realistic example.

Once I had that setup, I moved into the ""Validate"" part and added behavioral finance on top of it. This is where things started to make more sense. With a company like NeuroLink Robotics, which sounds futuristic and exciting, it's very easy for investors to fall into behavioral traps. People might jump in simply because everyone else is buying, which is herding. Some investors become overconfident and believe they understand the industry better than the entire market. Anchoring happens when people fixate on a price target they saw online. And loss aversion keeps investors holding onto bad positions longer than they should. When I considered these biases, the unrealistic $160 price didn't feel so strange anymore.

Finally, in the ""Evolve"" and ""Reflect"" parts of DRIVER, I asked what this means for me as an analyst. What I learned is that large markets are mostly efficient most of the time—prices do include a lot of information. But they're not perfectly efficient, especially when hype is involved, or when information is complicated, emotional, or confusing. So my takeaway is that I shouldn't blindly trust the market price, and I also shouldn't blindly trust my own model. The market price is a very strong starting point, but it isn't always the final truth. Using DRIVER helped me outline the problem clearly, represent the theory in simple terms, imagine how prices react to events, check the role of behavior, and update my own understanding. Overall, inefficiencies do exist, but they're selective and need to be approached very carefully. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"My project uses the GameStop short squeeze as a case study to test how well the Efficient Market Hypothesis actually holds up during extreme market events. Before I jumped into the code, I structured everything using the full DRIVER framework. That means I started by defining and discovering the core questions and verifying basic facts. Then I represented the methodology by laying out the event-study structure. After that, I implemented the models, validated their significance and robustness, evolved the analysis to look at deeper implications, and finally reflected on how EMH, behavioral finance, and market microstructure all fit together.

Once the framework was set, I organized the data work into two loops. Loop 1 builds the full event-study foundation. Loop 2 strengthens the analysis with Fama-French factors, sentiment proxies, and borrow-fee dynamics.

The research questions I focused on were three things. First, did GME's price behavior match weak, semi-strong, or strong-form efficiency. Second, could a rational investor have systematically profited in real time. And third, were the extreme movements better explained by behavioral finance and market microstructure rather than EMH.

Before running any analysis, I had to do some fact checking. There was a claim that GameStop traded at four cents in August 2020, so I pulled the daily pricing data to confirm. My output showed a minimum price of 1.04 dollars, a maximum of 1.67 dollars, and an average of 1.20 dollars for the month. So GME was a one-dollar stock, not a penny stock. Getting this right matters because all EMH testing depends on accurate baseline prices.

In Loop 1, I built the entire event-study framework around three major public events. The Ryan Cohen stake in September 2020, which serves as a semi-strong efficiency test. The short squeeze peak in January 2021, which tests both weak and semi-strong efficiency. And the congressional hearings in February 2021, which are another semi-strong test.

To implement this, I defined an estimation window from April through August 2020. I used CAPM to estimate expected returns, computed daily abnormal returns, calculated cumulative abnormal returns, ran t-tests on the abnormal returns, and visualized CAR patterns across all three events.

The CAPM model gave me a daily alpha of 0.0087 and a beta of 0.3784. What that means is that GameStop earned about 0.87 percent excess return per day in the estimation window, which is extremely high, and the stock only moved about 38 percent as much as the market. So it behaved like a low-beta stock with unusually high excess returns, which already suggests CAPM does not fully explain it.

Then I ran t-tests on abnormal returns for each event window. The Cohen event produced a t-value of 1.14 and a p-value of 0.2673. The short squeeze window gave a t-value of 0.52 with a p-value of 0.6089. And the congressional hearing window gave a t-value of 0.01 with a p-value of 0.9917. Because all these p-values are above five percent, we statistically cannot reject the idea that average abnormal return is zero. Volatility is massive during the squeeze, so statistical power is weak even though the economic movements are huge.

When you look at the cumulative abnormal return plots, the Cohen event is basically flat, which fits semi-strong efficiency. The short squeeze, the red line, jumps above plus 2.5, which means more than a 250 percent abnormal return inside the twenty-day event window. And the congressional window shows only a small temporary bump. Visually, the squeeze is a clear economic violation of EMH, even though the daily AR variance makes the t-tests noisy.

Volume data supports the same story. Volume was normal through 2020, then exploded in January 2021. Price movement lines up perfectly with the volume surge, which is a pattern typically explained by retail herding rather than new fundamentals.

Then in Loop 2, I strengthened and validated the findings by adding a multi-factor model, adding sentiment data, and adding short-borrow fee behavior. This loop gives a deeper interpretation beyond just CAPM.

The Fama-French regression produced a daily alpha of 1.8012 percent, which annualizes to about 454 percent per year. The R-squared was only 0.103, meaning the model explains barely 10 percent of the variation. The market beta was negative at –1.6518 and significant. SMB was extremely large and positive at 5.7454, and HML wasn't significant. A 454 percent alpha is obviously not a real premium — it's the model trying to absorb the anomaly. Ninety percent of GME's returns are idiosyncratic noise. The negative market beta and massive SMB loading show that the stock behaves like an extreme, sentiment-driven microcap, not a rational factor-priced asset. The Jarque-Bera statistic was over 13,000, confirming extremely non-normal residuals with skew and fat tails. So the multi-factor model actually strengthens the case that fundamentals cannot explain the GME movement.

Next I used Google Trends as a retail-attention proxy. The spikes in search interest line up perfectly with the price spikes. This is textbook behavioral finance — attention-induced trading, herding, overconfidence, and narrative cascades. These movements aren't reactions to cash-flow news; they're reactions to social-media attention.

I also plotted the borrow-fee rate to capture limits to arbitrage. During the squeeze, borrow fees spiked from around three percent to roughly fifteen percent, and brokers restricted buying. For arbitrageurs, this means high shorting costs, risk of forced buy-ins, shrinking liquidity, and asymmetric restrictions. Even if you knew the stock was overpriced, the structure of the market prevented you from correcting it. This is exactly what limits to arbitrage looks like in practice.

Putting everything together, outside the squeeze window GME behaves somewhat like a normal small-cap stock. During the squeeze, weak and semi-strong efficiency break down completely. Multi-factor models cannot explain the returns. Retail attention and herding overwhelm any fundamental story. And arbitrage is crippled by frictions like borrow fees and trading restrictions. The result is a short-lived but extreme market inefficiency.

So my final conclusion is that markets are mostly efficient most of the time, but efficiency collapses when behavioral forces and market frictions overlap. The GameStop squeeze doesn't show that markets are always broken; it shows that during rare episodes, attention substitutes for information, social behavior overwhelms fundamentals, and the mechanisms that normally enforce efficiency stop working. That mix produces explosive inefficiencies that traditional EMH cannot fully explain.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is
Christine Xiong and this is my
session 8 assignment. Our primary mission
for this assignment is to investigate market
efficiency using the GameStop GME event.
This requires us to test the claims made
in the assignment overview against
objective verifiable data. and um our first
critical step here we see is to verify
the statement that gamestop traded at
0.04 cents in august 2020 against actual
historical data if incorrect document
the accurate figures and determine
appropriate communication approach for correcting
the professor so the information
we have is the event timeline from august
2020 to the present or february 2021 congressional
hearings on market manipulation and the
key data points of short interest peaked
and the analyst fundamental values estimating
from 10 to 40 dollars per share and required
um analysis we'll get to um and so like
i said the first task that we need to do
in this assignment is to verify the specific
statement that game stock traded at 0.04
cents in august 2020. initial discovery and
data cross-referencing a preliminary review
of available data immediately flags this
as a potential error data from market sources
covering 2020 to 2021 shows a 52 week low
for gme of 20.73 while historical charts show
an all-time high um all -time high of 483
dollars no data suggests a price level of 0.04
there is a simple code that um um that shows
as um the code where you put yf finance which
is directly imports financial data from
yahoo finance onto google collab and so
we by using that um yes we use the yf
library imported we call it a ticker function
and then it creates a special ticker object
a bundle of data and functions right from
yahoo finance like i said and um with all
that it gives you his growth historical data
for gme in august 2020 and therefore the lowest
price was in august 2020 which was one
dollar which occurred on 2020 of august 3rd
this statement gamestop traded at 0.04 uh
four cents in august 2020 is highly incorrect
and that was just a script of it and um
import yfin is as yf yes and pandas is pd yes
yes yes it is just is the same code as the
one above where the ticker of the GameStop
or GME like was at $1 not 0.04 cents and this
is just a historical data that you get
with the code I got we just downloaded data
this is the price first volume disconnect the
downloaded data for gme and spy for the
period of 2019 to 2021 which we can see right
here from august 2020 to february 2021 just
the entirety and then to make the chart we
just um isolated that adjacent close and
volume data and um yeah um one source like
um it showed like um in its daily market
summary shows a line item of negative 0.04 cents
uh a negative point zero negative point
zero negative 0.04 negative 0.19 percent
another source clarifies this stating gamestop
traded at 21 dollars 40 and 45 cents decreasing
0.04 cents or zero decreasing 0.04 cents
or 0.19 percent this demonstrates that 0
.04 cents was a daily price change a delta
not an absolute price level the most probable
source of the error in the assignment
prompt is a common data reading mistake
misinterpreting the change column in a stock table
as a low or close column and to conclude
that statement the statement gamestop traded
at 4 cents in August 2020 is factually
incorrect like I stated within the data we see
that it's one dollar not four cents um and
we will continue to verify this in the
implementation stage where the actual price of
the GME in August 2020 was like around like
four dollars to six dollars range and to
note that these are like pre-stock split prices
all prices in this report will be adjusted
for consistency and then um the communication
strategy uh and to say like um that
this prompt mentions to go to go forth with
what my professor said to go with like how
four cents is the price they traded at in
august 2020 and within the historical data
we could see that um i am finding that
the actual closing price for gme during
that month was in the four dollar four to
five dollar range. And interestingly
enough, I defined several data
sources that list four cents as a
daily price change. That's one, and
this is two. As a daily price change,
a delta for GME, I suspect this might be
the source of the figure. For the purpose of
the analysis, I'll proceed by documenting
the discrepancy in my driver analysis as
required using the usual historical closing price
from a reliable data source Yahoo! Finance
import as we see like I said and as the correct
August 2020 baseline for my analysis and
then now we must verify the other foundational
facts of the event sure interest peaked
at 140% we see that right here sure key
data points that we need to uncover um this is
verified this is the central objective catalyst
for the entire event multiple academic and
journalistic sources confirmed that the
short interest in gme exceeded its public float
peaking at approximately 140 this physical
impossibility more shares short shorted
than available to trade created the tinderbox for
the squeeze the melvin um capital sustained
53 percent loss which is verified the hedge
fund melvin capital which held a large
short position suffered catastrophic losses
reports from january 2021 confirmed the fund
lost 53 percent of its asset under management
required two dollars and 75 cents billion
bailout from other funds katadol and 0.72 i'm
sorry if i'm pronouncing it wrong um this
quantifies extreme limits to arbitrage
risk and then in january 2021 uh the
reddit um our wall street bets driven
price search to 483 dollars this is also
verified this was the intraday high price
pre-market value briefly hit over 500
reached on january 28 2021 this is the peak
of the anomaly and the analyst fundamental
value estimating at $10 to $40 per share
this is also verified as a reasonable
synthesis of the pre -squeeze consensus no
single source gives this exact range but it
is strongly supported um morning stars
quantitative price versus fair value chart for
2020 shows a fair value estimate in
the $10-$20 range. Analysts target for
2020-2021 were low with many downgrades, examples
from buy to sell. One 2026 price
target based on fundamentals
is $13.77. The general consensus
was that GMB's price was difficult
to reconcile with. Fundamental value,
the $10-$40 range accurately represents
the fundamental anchor from which
the price became detached uh now
we define the core financial theories
um theories um the efficient market
hypothesis um emh um in its simplest form posits
that asset prices fully reflect all available
information um this implies that it is
impossible to like beat the market systematically
the theory has three forms and the gme
event tests all of them number one the weak
form which is prices reflect all past market
data the historical prices and trading volume
implication is that technical analysis is
useless and the gme test is the first form
we will test did the gme price movements show
predictable patterns the massive price run
up on high volume is a momentum effect which
is a no market anomaly some studies concluded
that the gme returns were not randomly
distributed suggesting a clear violation of
the weak form emh semi -strong form number two
semi-strong form which is basically a process
reflect all publicly available information
like news earnings report analyst ratings
and crucially social media posts etc the
implications of these are that both technical
analysis and fundamental analysis um for example
reading financial statements are useless
the only way to gain an edge is with
like private information from inside and the
gme test is that that we got is that this is
the central battleground of our entire analysis
um the gme event presents as a paradox
on one hand it's like a massive violation
that the price of 483 dollars was completely
disconnected from the fundamental public
information for example like gme's 10q filing
which showed a 295.8 million net loss on
the other hand it might be like a hyper
efficient thing the price instantly and brutally
reflected a new kind of public information
that like 140 percent short interest data and
the collective intent of our wall street's
bets to exploit it our analysis and explore
this like kind of once and last but not
least number three a strong form which is
a prices reflect all information both public
and private for example like information
known only to company insiders um and the
application is that nobody can systematically beat
the market and using the gme test this form
is widely considered false in reality due
to insider trading laws the gme event is no
exception any investor with private knowledge
of melvin um capital's portfolio or the
precise timing of the wall street's bets
could have profited enormously this form is
considered disproven uh and then our like
core concept two which is behavioral finance
um this school of thought in contrast
to emh argues that investors are not
rational it posits that psychological
and cognitive biases can and do cause
prices to deviate from their fundamental
values for extended periods gme is a
textbook case uh let's see what else do i
hmm um key biases that are identify hurting
and hurting stinked um this is when investors
follow the crowd instead of their own
analysis it is often driven by fear of missing
out fomo the r wall street's best forum
acted as a powerful high -speed mechanism for this
hurting behavior and the overconfidence bias
disbias occurs when investors have
inflated sense of their own abilities um it
manifested on both sides of the gme trade hedge
funds and overconfidence in the short thesis
leading them to take a short position
greater than 100 of the float and retail traders
a belief that there were above average
and could collectively beat wall street
professionals anchoring biases is the tendency
to rely too heavily on the first piece of
information information such as price purchase
price or peak price this bias helps explain
the extreme volatility after the peak investors
who bought at 400 may have anchored to
that price refusing to sell at 150 contributing
to volatility yes and then another core
concept we have is to limit to arbitrage this
theory is to bridge that reconciles emh
and behavioral finance the question is that
if gme was obviously overpriced at 483
dollars like it says here in january 21 why didn't
rational investors simply short sell it
and force the price back down to its 10 and
40 to 40 fundamental value and um and
to answer that question it's because
in the real world arbitrage is not free
it's incredibly risky um the gme event is a
perfect illustration of these limits and
these identified limits are um because
it's a fundamental risk and noise trader
risk and market microstructure issues
to briefly explain all three of them the
fundamental risk is like a small risk
that the short sellers were wrong and that ryan
cohen could actually turn gamestop around
to the noise trader risk is the key limit
um it is the risk that irrational
traders like the r wall street bets herd can
remain irrational longer than the arbitrator
can remain solvent and um short sellers
face infinite potential losses the gme
short squeeze is the textbook example of noise
trader risk culminating in melvin capital's
53 percent loss then market microstructure
issues uh the initial view manipulation
this was widely seen by the public as a
market manipulation to save the hedge funds
and a deeper analysis is um that we get is a
systematic failure and the conclusion of all
this is that the halt was the ultimate limit
to arbitration the plumbing of the
market itself broke it demonstrates that the
market is not frictionless a core and false
assumption of pure emh and to fact check what's
the true price of gme in august 2020 what
was the true price of gme in august what
is the likely source of the four cents
discrepancy um does a visual and quantitative
analysis of gme's price and volume data
show evidence of momentum or non-random patterns
that violate the weak form emh and
and so on so on more more more more questions
um that we'll get to um the core of our
quantitative oh yes this would
probably explain better i should
have put this on that's completely
my bad but um this table is not
just a history lesson it is like our primary
and analytical tool it isolates the
specific dates we will test in our implement
stage it allows us to classify the type
of information the market was processing
um for example like the fundamental versus
the sentiment versus market structure this
classification is essential for testing
the semi-strong emh um for the expected result
like i said for the beginning um moving
in with the spy line throughout 2019 and
most of 2020 then in january 2021 the jeremy
line will go vertical um right here that we
see i'll go vertical completely detached
from spy the volume chart bottom panel
will show a massive um um corresponding
spike at the exact same time and which
is we'll call this exhibit a um our goal
is to quantify the anomaly we will
calculate gme's abnormal return the ar the
formula is abnormal return equals actual
return minus the put it the expected return
this is the key methodological step
of complex approach would use the
capital asset pricing model which calculates
expected return based on beta and the
risk-free rate. We will not use CAPM
if it violates it. The GME returns are
so enormous, like example, plus 100
% in a single day that the marginal
difference between the CAPM expected
return, example, 0 .1% and a simple market
return, example, of 0.2% is completely
irrelevant. We use the market
adjusted model. We'll define GME's
expected return as simply the return of the
market on that day, SPI returns equals SPI
data, close PCT change. Now we see here,
the goal is to see the total
accumulative effect of the
anomaly over time. And the formula we
use is car equals some abnormal
returns over our event window. and
the code is car equals a normal
return comes sum. To plot our car from
this code right here, we're time and see
exactly what occurred. We will plot the car
line. We will then add vertical lines
for our key and then the expected
we will see the car line bounce around
zero noise for all of 2019 and 2020. This
proves our model is stable and GME
is stable and GME on an average day
performed as expected. Then around January
13, 2020, we will see the car line
go vertical, confirming the mass
of sudden injection of positive abnormal
returns. This chart will be exhibit
B, which is here. Which you can't see
because it's blocking it but there's
a hint of a line right there where it
skyrockets up there section one price volume charts
from Exhibit A As a primary evidence to structure our
written analysis for The B form image analysis We will argue that
the clear visual evidence of momentum
effect massive price search on high volume
that continues for days is a violation of the
weak form emh which states past price
patterns cannot predict future returns um you
will use the car event from exhibit b um right
here as our primary evidence we will present
um this is for semi -strong form emh analysis
uh two interpretation we discovered indeed
to the inefficient view and an nuanced
efficiency view um the inefficient view the
price of 483 dollars was a clear failure of
market efficiency as it did not reflect
the fundamental public information uh the nuanced
efficiency view the market was efficient it
instantly and brutally incorporated a
new form of public information the 140 short
interest data and the collective public intent
of walsh reached bets to exploit it um we will
argue the information that emh says it
reflected in the price is not just fundamental
information but any information that
affects supply and demand in this case sentiment
and fund flows and the strong form emh
analysis this will be a consensual argument
we will state that the event disproves strong
form efficiency as any investor with private
knowledge example a melvin capital employee
of the over leveraged short positions could
have ended like keith gill albeit with
public data achieve systematic abnormal
returns and to represent this is where we combine
the financial theories to build our final
conclusions for the evolve and reflect stages
so in the section one behavioral financing
so we will use this volume spike in it
exhibit a right here the volume spikes the bottom
data as a quantitative evidence of hurting
we will use reddit media quotes and the
state of wall street bets as a qualitative
evidence overconfidence and hurting we will use
the post peak volatility to discuss anchoring
investors anchored to the 483 dollars
high leading to erratic trading and the rational
investor profitability analysis we will use
the car plot in um subit b to show that
x post after the fact enormous once in a
lifetime profits were made um we will however
differentiate the initial thesis uh key skills
based on fundamental essential interest
was a rational ex ante value arbitrage
investment the mania that followed the january 2021
spike was a speculative exposed lottery and
then last but not least implications um
the activist passive we will argue gme is a
powerful argument for passive The event
highlights catastrophic non-fundamental firms,
specific risks that active managers, both
long and short, were exposed to. In policy
implications, we will discuss SEC's official
report that key issues are not just Reddit,
but gamification of trading platforms,
payment for order floor, PFOF, transparency, and
short selling, market plumbing, and T plus
two settlement cycles. um yes all that it gives you the
rundown from the code what
it means so this was generally just
to um visualize the price and
volume disconnect um and exhibit a if the
price is kind of volume link and um the chart is
a valid representation it visually validates
the link between the anomalous price
the what and the surge and retail trading the
why and then in exhibit b it was to generate
to quantify the abnormal returns over time
which you can see like all the dates and
stuff i don't not gonna i could scroll all the
way down yeah just a lot a bunch um the car
plot is validated it confirms that the
profile market anomaly occurred exactly when we
expected it this model was a successful in
isolating and quantifying it um and last but
not least we have like evolve um our
court um like how do our findings apply to the
broader world of finance what are the second and
third order implications of our validated
analysis the gme even provides like a
powerful real world case study for the active
versus passive debate um the primary lesson for
melvin capitol's 53 percent loss is that
noise for trader risk um it's not just an
academic theory but a real portfolio destroying
force the risk of shorting um was realized
in the most brutal way the market's
irrationality outlasted the rational short seller
solvency against active long picking the gme
event was also um dangerous for long active
managers a manager who owned gme based on
fundamentals was simply lucky and furthermore
a manager who bought gme at the peak of the
mania would have been anchored and suffered
huge losses for passive investing a passive
investor who simply owned an smp 500 index
fund like spy was almost completely
insulated from this firm specific non-fundamental
mania the gme event um is one of the strongest
arguments for passive investing it highlights
of catastrophic, unpredictable,
and unmodelable firm-specific
risk that active management exposes
a portfolio to. Our analysis of
the Robinhood salt show that the
plumbing of the market is a tangible risk.
The SEC's official report on the event
confirms this. And the GME event forced
regulators to evolve their thinking on
several key issues as well of gamification of
trading, short-selling transparency, payment
for order flow, and settlement cycles t
plus two um the evolving the asset substitution
problem this is like a high level
application of core finance it's like the asset
substitution problem is a classic agency
conflict in corporate finance it occurs in a
leveraged firm a firm with debt it describes
how equity holders who have limited downside
have an incentive to substitute safe low
risk assets projects with risk with risky high
stakes assets projects why if the why if the
risky project fails the debt holders bond
holders are wiped out if the risky projects
to seize the equity holders get all the
upside it's a heads i win tails you lose
bet that expropriate steals wealth from debt
holders and inverted application to gme we
can reframe the gme trade using this exact
logic of the leverage from the equity holders
to save assets and the risky asset uh now to
reflect uh the primary question was whether
gme event constitutes evidence against the
market efficiency um our analysis shows
that answer is nuanced the gme event does
not kill the emh and modernizes it and our
thesis is that the market is efficient but not
always rational in the 1970s on fundamental
based definition of the word the synthesis
the price of gme did reflect all available
information as the emh posits um the problem
for old models is that the most important
piece of available information was not the
gme's balance sheet um um the most important
information was the behavioral and
systematic the public 140 short interest data and
the public coordinated intent of a massive
group of retail traders to exploit it and the
final synthesis is that the market
efficiency process the behavioral information
the price of 483 um was in a strange way the
efficient price given the public knowledge that
i heard was acting on the 140 short
interest the gme event therefore is not a feeler
of the emh but a modern update to it where
the publicly available information now clearly
and demonstrably includes socially
informed collective intent finally last but not
least of the reflect part is that the gme
event does not prove the emh is wrong it proves
that the market is a complex adaptive system
it showed that weak form emh was violated
semi-strong form emh must be updated to
include social media sentiment as a new
powerful and
rapidly incorporated form of public
information and behavioral biases can when
coordinated become the fundamental information
that the market prices limits to arbitrage
are not the just theories they are the
most powerful forces in a market crisis um
ultimately the gme provided no rational systematic
profit opportunity for an investor it was
speculative lottery driven by rational
thesis term behavioral mania that was ultimately
cut short not by return to fundamentals
but by a mechanical failure of the market's
own plumbing thank you",,0,1

um relative to efficient market hypothes
predictions and then we're going to go
through all these steps how we talked
about how it's traded four four cents in
2020 against actual historical data if
accurate we're going to compare we have
a timeline
so go through some of the times we have
here we have
um August 2020 about GameStop nearing
bankruptcy.
And then month later, um the Chewy
Founder acquires a 13% stake, Wall
Street Bets has driven the price to
$483, which was pretty insane. I was I
remember when this happened. I was a
personal person going through this time.
Obviously, during COVID, so there wasn't
much going on. So uh then congressional
hearings and market manipulation and
then obviously postevent price uh
stabilization. We have all this data
that we've acquired here. We have our
acquired analysis.
We have our driver and then we have some
more analysis that we have here. So
obviously
um
for driver I use I use multiple multiple
iterations
actually took me multiple to get it
correct getting all the correct stuff a
lot of evolving a lot of figuring it out
all the analyzation
onto the Python and um answer it. So
obviously a lot of print here and more
print here. A lot of it a lot of it
we'll see as we go through
but there's so much analysis that
there's a lot to go through.
So going through let me just run this
again. Going through this is just
reaffirming the steps of driver which
are really cool. Going through all the
ideas and then there's execution here
which is all about the data
verifications. It's going through all
the data they gave us four cents. It's
between four Dollar 67.
Um, and it's going through all the steps
here, which I think is really, really
cool.
Um, obviously, this is Ryan Cohen's
investment,
the short interest peak, and then now
we're on to um, market efficiency
testing right here. So, as you can see,
we went through the we form
um, trading data reflected in the stock.
The GameStop event driven by social
media momentum, specifically Reddit,
appears to be a case of momentum trading
where past price actions led to more
buying. Obviously, it seems like I think
in this case there's people shorting the
stock. Semi- strong form violated the
semi- strong form states that all
publicly available information is
reflected in this price. system was
clear clearly violated of course
because
um the short interest was known to be
over 100%. As I brought up earlier it
was a lot of shorts they're short like
more than they should have which led to
the problems that we saw we saw Cohen's
active mistake was public knowledge all
this information now we have strong form
which was also violated
um it was by default because of the
public information isn't reflected in
the If it wasn't honestly I don't want
to go through all this because there's
so much analization so much words to go
through
to reflect all the ideas. We'll go
through some of the broadstrokes
because
I mean this was very um analysis heavy
so there's a lot of analysis to go
through.
So back to this obviously we have
identification behavioral biases.
There's Harding. They're hurting. This
was the primary driver. Overconfidence.
There's retail traders
who um obviously like hedge funds that
are very very overconfident in their
shorts which again which is what led to
I think some of them went bankrupt
because there was so much shorting on
Gamestock and the price was so high they
couldn't afford it which is insane for a
hedge fund of all places. I mean those
are places don't have a lot of money.
prospect theory loss aversion. Hedge
funds may have held their losing short
position for too long hoping it would
come back rather than realizing a
massive loss. This is another problem. I
mean if you're the hedge funds it's like
okay the it's going up past what you
want it to be. You would not expect it
expect it to peak at what $483 I think
is what they said. So fair enough.
There's a confirmation bias which was
investors on all sides saw information
that confirmed their existing beliefs
which makes sense obviously there was
games to the moon or is a worthless
company I mean obviously that's going to
reinforce their ideas what they think
limit valuation limits arbitrage
noise trader risk we have here where we
have um retail traders are so
overwhelming that it forced them to um
arbitrage out of the market which is
cool. Reclamation cost and then just go
through more of this
evaluation of systematic profit
opportunities
profit was not available
led to a chaotic event as they say a
black swan which is good way to put it
I'd say rational investor by definition
would have seen gametock at 100 or 5100
and 300 included it was overvalued and
stayed away or shorted and lost. That's
Yeah, that's probably true. The thing is
this was this scenario is so irrational.
Yeah, the irrational narrative. Yeah,
exactly.
Antie versus X post.
Um, easy to say you should have bought
in five and sold and that's obviously
looking in hindsight, you know, and for
the anti side obviously it was
impossible to know that something like
that was going to happen. going through
implications.
EMH versus behavioral
fails to explain. I think it's very hard
to explain this just because of how odd
of a scenario, how big of a one-off it
is for something that peaks so highly,
but the behavioral for uh the behavioral
finance framework explained it pretty
well, saying it's a case study in
hurting overconfidence limits arbitrage,
which I do agree.
And then going through more of this we
have active versus passive
went through all these analysises
doesn't change much
obviously say that index fund tiny
amount
the yeah the rounding error so I guess
that makes sense but for active it was a
major warning probably more for the idea
of shorting how how volatile how risky
it can be for some of these companies
and then going through some market
structure
should brokers like Robin Hood beowed to
restrict trading. That's big key because
I do remember also in this case Robin
Hood stopped people from trading
GameStop GameStop
when it was basically peaking and
they're like okay something's wrong with
the market let's stop the trading at
GameStop which I mean honestly makes
pretty interesting sense and then does
this hurt the system for retail
investors that is a good thing to look
at because obviously retail investors
made a huge mistake here
and then should hedge funds have to
disclose their their short positions
more transparently. That's a big thing I
think would be interesting. I mean, it
would stop them from having this problem
ever again, most likely.
And then obviously through this, we have
more
analysises that we went through.
Um, but for the most part, that's a lot
of the analysis. There's a lot of
analysis of all the stuff that we just
ran through and all the ramifications
that took a while for me to do, getting
it all onto the actual Python, which was
pretty dang cool.
But, um,
for the most part, going through
all this information, I just say the
case itself is really, really cool. I
for a lot of these cases it's like
they're either something I I'm not like
that related to or something happened
before I was born. But I remember this
GameStop case when it happened
and I thought it was incredibly
interesting
that basically these people on the
internet who didn't know each other were
able to cause such a stir in the world
to to these companies. I mean it was all
over the place. I thought it was I mean
it was like I said it was co so there
wasn't a lot going on other than co but
it was incredibly interesting
and I think um that's important I think
that's an important thing I mean I'm not
the only one who's probably going to
remember this in this class or anything
else I think that's an important part
for all this analysis is that it's fresh
in people's mind and people it's it was
a very famous thing that happened but
thank you um that'll be the end of

",FALSE,1," Oh yeah, so for starters we have come over here, we used a little help from our AI.
00:11
 So our original issue was if GME or GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020.
00:21
 So that was the claim made.
00:23
 We did some further research, I looked through Yahoo and it reset on me.
00:29
 But we have all the August prices here, this value is the lowest prices.
00:33
 So we see in August the lowest it goes down to is a dollar.
00:38
 So we see this is also not right.
00:40
 I also used just a normal chat box and it's telling me it's a dollar sixty seven.
00:45
 So regardless, I'm sure that the 4 cents is probably not right.
00:51
 According to Yahoo it was lowest at a dollar on August 3rd as we can see here.
01:00
 So that's the number we're going to use.
01:05
 So for our discovery we have GME traded at .4 cents.
01:08
 Our AI said the low in April is down 2.57 but we're just going to use 1 for argument's
01:16
 sake.
01:20
 The closing price did increase a little bit, we saw that.
01:23
 So AI is not fully wrong.
01:25
 Let me GME price surge to .483, accurate.
01:32
 Short interest peaked at 140% of flow, accurate.
01:36
 Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss, we have accurate.
01:41
 The Melvin Capital lost 50% on its portfolio in January 2021 due to the squeeze.
01:50
 Acquiring a 2.75 billion capital injection which is absurd, that's an absurd capital loss.
01:58
 And then analyst fundamental value estimates 10 to 40 bucks and our AI says it's generally
02:04
 accurate.
02:05
 It estimates we're in this low range, maybe on the lower end closer to 10 than 40 but
02:11
 the range stands nonetheless.
02:13
 Don't need that, that's not right.
02:19
 Let me go down to our represent, we've already discovered, we've already done our looking
02:22
 around.
02:23
 We have our EMH test which is our efficiency market hypothesis.
02:32
 So we're going to analyze how the price surge to .483 for exceeding the 10 to 40 dollar
02:38
 fundamental value relates to the information that is publicly available kind of at the
02:43
 time.
02:44
 So let me go down, I mean they have some things in short interest around Cohen's stake but
02:51
 we'll get into that later.
02:53
 So our rational profitability is to determine if the profits were a result of systematic
03:00
 risk adjusted strategies based on fundamentals.
03:04
 So rational investing or non-systematic events even exploiting a market structure kind of
03:10
 anomaly or something that's not very likely to happen which is a short squeeze.
03:17
 So we're going to use behavioral finance concepts to explain the observed price deviation that
03:23
 the traditional EMH cannot account for.
03:28
 So let's implement a little bit.
03:31
 EMH violation analysis.
03:33
 So the GME short squeeze as we know exposed the violation of the semi-strong form of EMH
03:43
 as the weak form efficiency is potentially violated because the short squeeze was initiated
03:49
 by analyzing publicly available past market data.
03:54
 So the extremely high short interest and low flow to identify a technical vulnerability.
04:03
 So thousands of retail investors systematically profited basically by exploiting this public
04:11
 technical data which then suggests that prices did not fully reflect historical information
04:18
 in an efficient manner.
04:21
 So it's kind of a non-fundamental strategy to get short term returns.
04:27
 So weak form efficiency may be violated.
04:31
 Non-form efficiency or public information is clearly violated because the public information
04:38
 about the company's poor fundamentals then lead to the 140% short interest and the Ryan
04:47
 Cohen activist investment.
04:50
 These things were all known.
04:51
 So the market's inability to price kind of the short squeeze risk because it's obviously
04:58
 a very risky stock.
04:59
 They thought it was going to go bankrupt with how low it was even though it wasn't 4 cents
05:04
 until it was artificially triggered and then a subsequent price spike shot up to 483 which
05:12
 is way over the fundamental value which kind of demonstrates the catastrophic failure to
05:18
 efficiently incorporate all public information onto the stock.
05:23
 Then we have strong form efficiency or all information which is not really applicable
05:28
 because the event was kind of driven by publicly decimated information, not kind of inside
05:35
 information or insider trading or things of that nature.
05:40
 So then we'll go down to profitability for rational investors.
05:43
 So rational investors could not have systematically profited based purely on fundamental analysis
05:49
 because the short sellers, Melvin Capital and other short sellers, were the rational
05:53
 fundamental investors betting against the obviously weak company near bankruptcy as
05:59
 the analyst target $10 to $40 is their worth.
06:05
 So their losses of 53% show that a rational systematic strategy was kind of severely punished
06:12
 by a technical market anomaly.
06:17
 So gains, the immense profits were generally generated by non-rational speculation and
06:22
 coordination because an investor acting rationally would have sold long before the peak because
06:30
 based on the fundamental target value it's way below missing the bulk of the squeeze
06:35
 gains thus making the profit non-systematic because it relied kind of on a one-time non-repeatable
06:43
 event which is a retail-driven coordination effort to exploit a structural flaw.
06:54
 So the price should reflect fundamental value.
06:58
 The price surge obviously doesn't exceeding all fundamental value.
07:03
 And this is kind of not a normal investor behavior, not really a company value.
07:08
 So markets, we kind of see with trading, markets are frictionless allowing full trading at
07:12
 all times.
07:14
 Trading restrictions were implemented by brokers physically preventing trades at the peak of
07:19
 the volatility.
07:21
 This proves market frictions can and do override the smooth function of price discovery.
07:27
 So it's saying all these people were looking to coordinate at the same time and this is
07:38
 saying that things like Robinhood and other online trading websites don't let you trade
07:48
 when the stock proves too volatile.
07:52
 And then investor behavior, investors are rational and this was kind of rational is
07:59
 basically what it's saying.
08:00
 What happened?
08:01
 So let me go down to behavioral finance explanations for anomalies.
08:14
 So the squeeze anomaly is best explained by behavioral finance framework.
08:21
 So herd behavior is the sheer volume and speed of buying was due to thousands of retail investors
08:28
 acting in concert driven by kind of a social proof and centralized narrative on a Reddit
08:38
 forum actually.
08:40
 So it seems like, I actually watched a documentary about this last year where all these people
08:50
 on Reddit just got together and decided to all just speed buy all these stocks at the
08:58
 same time to drive up the price.
09:00
 So we have narrative bias which is the stock became a social clause giving kind of the
09:07
 traders a non-financial incentive to hold their buy which kind of kept the price inflated
09:13
 more than it was worth just because people like an underdog story is basically what it's
09:18
 saying.
09:19
 So we have framing and availability heuristic which is that the 483 price was amplified
09:26
 by media and social platforms like Reddit making high speculative returns seem more
09:32
 likely and motivating.
09:34
 So this kind of just furthered the more rational buying of GME.
09:39
 And then obviously the short squeeze risk because the market mechanism itself became
09:43
 the anomaly and kind of the obligation of short sellers to buy back shares was kind
09:50
 of exploited because no one wants to buy back these shares at such a high value.
09:54
 Kind of temporarily turning a fundamentally bad stock into an exponentially rising one
09:59
 at least for the short term.
10:01
 So I'm going to validate the price disconnect.
10:06
 Obviously the price reached 483 which is a massive disconnect from the fundamental value
10:11
 of 10 to 40 that we originally stated.
10:15
 There's a short seller failure with Melvin's capital 53% loss which kind of confirms that
10:22
 traditional rational strategies failed in this anomaly instance.
10:28
 And then regulatory action, the congressional hearings and trading restrictions confirmed
10:32
 the highly abnormal non-efficient nature of the event which kind of drew scrutiny to market
10:37
 structure itself because these people just exploited this one stock based on a Reddit
10:42
 post which seems a little easy to start affecting markets and creating uproar within the economy.
10:51
 So it's kind of crazy how much scrutiny and how they had congressional hearings based
10:57
 on a bunch of Reddit users all buying at once.
11:01
 And then we see that the EMH framework needs to evolve to integrate these anomalies.
11:11
 The event that GME had suggests the market structure is susceptible to crowdfunded manipulation
11:18
 like we were just talking about, exploiting flaws in mass communication, it could be via
11:23
 social media or anything, which kind of requires a hybrid model where efficiency varies over
11:30
 time based on market conditions, investor psychology, and available technology, social
11:36
 media like we talked about before.
11:39
 So in all, to reflect, the GME short squeeze strongly suggests that markets are not semi-strong
11:46
 efficient when a structural flaw, like a 140% short interest, is identified and exploited
11:53
 by coordinated behaviorally driven capital.
11:56
 So these anomalies are not evidence against the entire concept of market efficiency, but
12:02
 rather demonstrate that the market structure kind of does have critical points of failure
12:07
 that allow behavioral forces to dominate these sort of rational pricing mindsets, particularly
12:14
 with the advent of low cost, social media fueled retail trading like GME.

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Hector Sen and this is my video submission for the session 8 assignment. So for this assignment, I'm analyzing on the efficient market hypothesis using the GameStop short squeeze uh event as a case study. So uh first of all I started with uh the define and discover stage of the driver of my driver framework where I established the core pro problem for this assignment which was to test the efficient market hypothesis using the GME event like I previously said. So uh the assignment first of all had a critical first step which was to verify that the uh the statement that GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020. So after uh my investigation I found this statement to be incorrect. Uh according to my research uh the which I use Yahoo Finance for uh for the actual split adjusted stock price in August 2020 was between $1.04 and $1.67. So this uh data correction was my first analytical finding and uh from here on now uh my entire analysis analysis will be done using this corrected verified historical data. So now that I have the data corrected uh I developed three of my main uh research questions. So the first question is which forms of the uh efficient market market hypothesis did the GME event violate the so in in uh these forms I have the weak semi- strong and strong. Uh the second question was what behavioral biases and social factors explain the price action that the efficient market hypothesis cannot and third of all why couldn't rational investors you short the stock back to its fundamental value.

So now onto my uh represent step or or the represent stage. Uh my plan was to first of all download GM GM's price and volume data from 2019 to the to the present to get a clear baseline and second I plan to create uh two key visualizations which uh will help me uh with my analysis. The first the first one would be an event study of a price and volume uh to see the anomaly of this event and the second plot would be my main EMA test plot which would be plotting the stock market's price against against its own fundamental value band. So this plan would give me the visual evidence needed to test the weak and semi- strong forms of uh market efficiency.

So now on to uh my implement stage of the driver framework. Let's run the my code which I wrote with help of Google Gemini

and well in this code I first uh uh installed the Yahoo Finance Python library as it as seen here in the beginning uh and imported all the other necessary libraries. for the code to run and get this important data. Uh for example, uh the the code also downloads the uh the GME historical data uh confirming the 2020 prices. So now that the code has run, as you can see here in my first wait,

as you can see here in my first plot, uh this is my event study. Uh you can clearly see the price uh on the price on a log scale and the corresponding volume. So the annotations mark the key events from uh Ryan's coin's investment to the peak in January 2020. So this visual confirms the anomaly. Second of all uh here's my uh second plot uh which is my main analytical test. So here I've plotted the market price in blue against the publicly known fundamental value band and uh uh which is in red and the red band represents the $2 $50 to $10 split adjusted analyst estimates. So as you can see the market price completely decoupled from all public uh fundamental information and this massive gap is the abnormal return that the efficient market hypothesis cannot explain. So this is a clear v visual violation of the semi strong form. Now onto my validate step.

So uh basically I perform a sanity check for this uh and my code ran successfully and the Yahoo Finance and the GME historical data uh you know uh were accurate as I uh checked it with the actual Yahoo Finance website and the data validated my initial data correction. So the plots are therefore the plots are accurate and you know match the known uh historical uh data of the event. Um so onto my evolve step.

So I looked at how uh to take this analysis deeper. uh and first of all um I thought that to evolve this uh analysis in uh quantitative way the next step would be to calculate the community cumulative abnormal return or the C using the CAPM model and not just visualize it and second of all I deepened the why you know why you know this happened so this wasn't just hurting it was specific biases uh like social identity and the house money effect for investors who got in early and finally I analyze the limits to arbitrage so rational investors couldn't stop this because of specific operational constraints so number one there was no shares to borrow so the short interest was at 140% uh the second of all the short squeeze mechanic itself forced short sellers to buy and third of all margin calls forced even rational funds to liquidate at a loss becoming part of the problem and finally in the reflect stage um here are my conclusions. So first of all uh my first finding is that the uh GME event was a decisive realworld violation of the efficient market hypothesis as it is clearly it has clearly violated the weak form and as part two shows it annihilated the semi- strong form. My second finding is that the why uh so that would be my second research question uh is that it has uh a two-part answer. So basically why it happened it's because it was kind of a perfect storm where behavioral biases provided the fuel and the market's operational mechanics which uh you know are the limits to arbitrage provided the engine for the explosion. Let's say and lastly on the process itself the of this analysis the driver framework was essential. So the define stage forced me to verify the data first uh and make sure that uh which ma made me make sure that I had the correct historical data for my uh analysis and it helped me to immediately catch the error that was g that was given to us in the assignment prompt. And so this would be uh almost one of the most critical parts of my assignment. So yeah, that's it. Thank you for watching.",,0,1

Hi, how's it going? I'm Sandy Skinner,
0:02
and this was my session eight market
0:05
efficiency and behavioral finance assignment.
0:08
So we want to investigate the market
0:10
efficiency and sort of analyze this
0:12
whole situation with GameStop in the
0:15
short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021.
0:18
So the first thing I sort of wanted to
0:20
understand was what exactly was this? And so I
0:22
went to Gemini and I sort of asked it to
0:24
analyze what happened with GameStop in 2020.
0:27
and we found out that essentially a large
0:30
group of individual retail investors
0:33
drove up the price of GameStop
0:35
at an unprecedented rate.
0:37
So GameStop was considered a failing
0:39
business as their brick and mortar of selling
0:42
physical video games was being replaced
0:44
by digital downloads. So a ton of hedge
0:46
funds actually, most notably Melvin Capital,
0:50
which lost 53%, as we saw in the earlier
0:52
thing, began to short sell the stock.
0:54
um and however a few users on r
0:58
slash wall street bets uh argued
1:01
the company was undervalued and
1:03
as um thousands of retail investors
1:06
saw that they began to buy which
1:09
meant the stock began to climb
1:11
and the hedge funds saw this price pricing
1:13
price rising and started losing millions
1:16
stopped the bleeding they were forced
1:18
to cover their shorts so they had to buy
1:19
gamestop shares which created the cycle of
1:22
buying and buying and buying and buying
1:23
which drove the price up extremely rapidly
1:27
and at this point robin hood and several
1:30
other brokers did something that sparked
1:31
massive outrage they halted the buy button
1:33
for gamestop and gamestop and other
1:35
quote-unquote meme stocks because it was
1:38
causing unprecedented changes in the market
1:40
now moving on to the actual assignment uh
1:44
the first step was to verify the statement
1:46
And GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020.
1:49
So what I did here is I went into Yahoo
1:50
Finance and I went to August 2020 down here.
1:54
And we can see that the lowest it was
1:57
trading at was around $1.10 and was
1:59
steady climbing up at that point too.
2:02
Specifically after in September,
2:08
what's his name?
2:09
Ryan Cohen acquired a 13% stake. So this
2:12
price was actually up a lot, which could also
2:15
sort of lead to, I mean, it was steadily
2:17
rising this entire time. So we can see why
2:20
a lot of people wanted to sell it as it
2:23
would cause potentially it to be overvalued.
2:28
So I went into CoLab here and I typed
2:33
in all the information about it,
2:35
all the cash flows to try and understand
2:37
this market efficiency analysis.
2:42
Whether rational investors could have
2:44
profited systematically, efficient
2:47
market hypothesis predictions to observe
2:49
behavior, and behavioral finance
2:51
explanations for these observed anomalies.
2:53
So the first step was this market efficiency
2:56
analysis, which provided a compelling case
2:59
for examining the EMH. So a weak form EMH,
3:03
prices reflect all past trading, semi-strong
3:06
form EMH, prices reflect all publicly
3:07
available information, and strong form, prices
3:10
reflect all public and private information.
3:12
So this is a significant challenge to the
3:14
semi-strong form EMH because it reflects all
3:17
publicly available information, as the
3:19
massive price surge goes far beyond what would
3:22
be justified for this fundamental publicly
3:24
available information of $10 to $40 per
3:27
share, and it was heavily influenced by
3:29
publicly available information shared and
3:31
amplified on social media platforms like Reddit,
3:33
which led to this coordinated buying
3:35
activity and the stock to go up exponentially.
3:42
Additionally,
3:44
information was incorporated
3:45
rapidly, but not always rationally.
3:48
The high short interest of 140% was publicly
3:51
available and became a central piece
3:53
of the narrative on platforms like Reddit.
3:55
This led to more
3:56
coordinated buying activity.
3:58
which was driven by online
4:00
communication and acted as a form
4:02
of information or a catalyst.
4:04
And the price reaching $483,000 suggests
4:06
that the information being incorporated
4:07
was heavily influenced by speculation,
4:09
sentiment, and the mechanics of the squeeze
4:11
itself, rather by solely the intrinsic
4:14
value of GameStop's business, which would be
4:16
part of the semi -strong image. So we can
4:19
see that there are many other factors
4:22
that influence rather than just the image.
4:24
It did, in fact, generate
4:26
abnormally massive returns.
4:30
and there's some potential predictability
4:33
for those who understood the market microstructure
4:36
of high short interest and low float.
4:38
However,
4:40
even if you know that there can be a short,
4:44
it's very hard to time it and understand
4:46
when it's going to go up and when it's
4:48
going to go back down, so it's a little
4:50
irrational for people to have gotten exactly
4:52
that timing right as there was nothing
4:54
that fully said when that GameStop price
4:58
was just going to shoot up exponentially.
5:00
Now moving on to the
5:02
behavioral finance analysis,
5:04
which explores the impact of psychological
5:07
factors, biases, and heuristics on financial
5:10
decision-making and market outcomes.
5:11
Hurting behavior was certainly prevalent.
5:14
A ton of people bought, and it just led to
5:16
more people keep buying and keep buying,
5:19
which created a snowball effect
5:22
and people to just again keep
5:23
buying and the stock to go up
5:26
exponentially additionally this is
5:27
what the confirmation bias as the
5:30
stock continued to rise and the fact
5:32
that people kept buying kept confirming
5:34
their beliefs the gambler fallacy
5:37
which led some people to believe the upward
5:39
trend would continue indefinitely and
5:40
on the other side that a reversal was
5:42
quote-unquote due which could have led to
5:44
bad decisions such as selling early right
5:46
before it went up to that $483 mark or
5:50
buying late before it went way back down
5:54
or when it went up to that $483 not selling
5:56
because they thought it could go up
5:58
even more. There's no way to really know.
6:06
Social media platforms are definitely
6:08
central to this hurting behavior.
6:11
Information sharing was widely shared and
6:13
discussed, and this was sort of coordinated
6:15
as well on the open discussion forum.
6:18
I mean, there's no way to fully say
6:19
it, but the shared sentiment led to a de
6:21
facto coordination of buying activity and
6:24
emotional contagion as well. The
6:25
excitement, enthusiasm, and sense of community
6:27
on these platforms are committed to
6:28
emotional decision -making and reinforced the
6:30
willingness to take on very high risk.
6:33
The game stop-squeeze certainly highlighted
6:37
significant limits to arbitrage, which
6:38
is a strategy of profiting from price
6:40
differences in different markets or from a
6:42
mispricing relative to fundamental value.
6:44
They would typically short an overvalued
6:46
stock like GameStop to profit when the price
6:50
eventually corrected. However, in this case,
6:51
there was so much risk involved, and when
6:53
it squeezed, they had to buy back those
6:55
shares at even higher prices to cover their
6:57
positions, so it's very, very high losses.
7:02
Now, moving on to rational
7:05
investor profitability.
7:06
vulnerability um while the short high short
7:10
interest was a known vulnerability the
7:12
trigger and magnitude of the squeeze were
7:14
driven by factors that are super difficult
7:16
for rational models to predict or
7:17
systematically exploit because you never know how
7:19
humans are going to react even if you
7:22
think you have an idea of it um shorting game
7:25
stop was certainly a rational strategy
7:27
based on intrinsic value but there was
7:29
significant risk due to that squeeze mechanics
7:31
So when it goes up to that 423, even when
7:34
you're short, there's so much money that
7:36
it's up that you have to cover your position,
7:39
and that can lead to losing money even
7:41
if it is to go back down in the future.
7:45
For analysis of those risk-adjusted
7:48
returns, people who bought early when it
7:50
was fundamentally undervalued, they
7:52
probably got very high returns, and if
7:55
they sold another peak additionally,
7:57
the risk-adjusted returns
8:00
were astronomical.
8:01
However, if they bought during the squeeze,
8:04
GameStop carried an immense risk.
8:07
There was no way to know if it was going
8:09
to go back down, and if people bought
8:10
up when it was $400 and weren't able to
8:14
sell when it was up to $483, they could
8:16
have lost unlimited amount of money.
8:20
This was public information.
8:22
However, not everybody has read it, and not
8:25
everyone was able to understand this, as
8:27
it's a very specific app so a lot of people
8:30
weren't aware of it and having that information
8:33
certainly would have been important.
8:37
Now moving on to theoretical implications
8:43
the GameStop event served as a real world
8:46
stress test for the EMH as we saw that
8:49
public information is not always everything
8:52
as social media sentiment and high short
8:54
interest can be incorporated into prices in
8:56
ways that significantly misprice stocks and
9:01
lead to extremely high volatility, which
9:03
the traditional EMH does not account for.
9:06
However, it does align very well with
9:08
the principles of behavioral finance.
9:10
If you were able to understand how
9:12
people would react to everything, you
9:13
certainly may have been able to profit
9:15
and say, okay, people are going to
9:17
buy now, people are going to sell now.
9:20
If you were able to understand that, you
9:22
could have sold when it was at that super
9:23
high $400 price and bought when it
9:26
started going up a little bit because you
9:28
knew people were going to keep going up.
9:31
For active management
9:33
and implication of it,
9:37
this would be supported by the fact
9:39
that traders who successfully
9:41
navigated the volatility achieve
9:43
significant abnormal returns, which
9:46
suggests opportunities exist to outperform
9:48
the market if you look for it. However,
9:51
passive management for long-term passive
9:53
investors is certainly also supported by
9:57
this as there was so much risk taken on in
10:00
that that a lot of people probably lost
10:01
money as well. And by just avoiding that
10:04
altogether, you could have avoided losing a
10:08
heck ton of money in this whole situation.
10:11
And so either way, you would have
10:13
had to be a very good active manager
10:15
and also gotten lucky and understood
10:16
when to sell and when to buy.
10:18
Now the efficiency policy implications,
10:22
market transparency, questions were certainly
10:25
raised about the transparency of short
10:27
interest data and retail trading volume,
10:29
policies that enhance the visibility of these
10:31
factors could be considered, and this is
10:35
sort of an example of market manipulation.
10:39
while distinguishing between genuine
10:41
sentiment and manipulative behavior
10:43
on social media is challenging.
10:44
This event certainly sparked discussions
10:46
about the potential for coordinated
10:47
action to manipulate markets and whether
10:49
existing regulations are sufficient.
10:50
We know that Robinhood actually
10:53
stopped the buy button, which was
10:55
sort of against this, and probably
10:58
saved some money in the long run,
11:00
but was also considered to be somewhat
11:05
unethical and not allowed, and so it
11:08
was hard for people to understand what
11:11
was really the right thing to do there.
11:14

",FALSE,1,"My name is Ethan Sleet and this is my market efficiency investigator.
[10:10] on the GameStop short squeeze. So the objective of this project was to test how efficiently markets incorporate new information.
[20:20] specifically whether GameStop's Extreme Price behavior in 2020 and 2021 have violated the efficient market hypothesis or EMH.
[30:30] The star I verified the factual claim for our assignment starting or stating games
[40:40] 2020 and using the Yahoo Finance data, the lowest adjusted close that month was around $4.00 not 4 cents. So that statement was...
[50:50] clearly inaccurate. So, documenting, correcting this kind of data claim is critical because we analyze
[60:00] market efficiently.
[70:10] um so the it's
[80:20] The efficient market hypothesis, the EMH, has three forms, the weak form semi-strong and the strong form, which you see right here. And our main focuses...
[90:30] semi-strong efficiency which tests how quickly and accurately markets react to new and public information. Alongside this, I consider the behavioral bias.
[100:40] and like overconfidence, hurting and loss of a version that may explain the anomalies in the real markets such as the GameStop Frenzies.
[110:50] So I implemented an event to study using the CAPM framework to measure the abnormal return.
[120:00] the process automated in the Python. Download it for...
[130:10] You want to download GME SMP 500 and the T-Build proxy dated with Y Finance. Then you can commute that.
[140:20] access returns to the GME in the market and then estimate alpha and beta over 200 today estimation window and then you
[150:30] calculate the abnormal returns in the cumulative abnormal returns in the negative 10 to plus 10 day window around each day.
[160:40] And then unless you want to run statistical tests like T-tests in scientists who evaluate whether those abnormal returns are significantly different than zero.
[170:50] And then the code is a modular, meaning that is easy test or easily test new events or triggers with one line of input.
[180:00] So my results are here. The statistical results showed that the wall game stop had extremely high short.
[190:10] I have no road turns around key new dates. These effects were persistent or were not persistent. I'm sorry. Event day I have no road turns where statistically s-
[200:20] significant for January 27th, 2021 and then when reddit driven short squeeze pete it quickly mean-roverted.
[210:30] the pattern suggests temporarily an efficiency followed by rapid information and corporation, which still aligns with semi-strong EMH when viewed over.
[220:40] slightly longer horizon. But however the behavioral component is undeniable.
[230:50] combination of hurting behavior and overconfidence, created large short lived, mispronunciations and apertures and couldn't
[240:00] fully exploit due to the trading holds and the risk constraints. Classics examples of limits of arbitrage and then
[250:10] These are my numbers.
[260:20] And then to reflect this, so then to find this cover we clarified that
[270:30] misinformation and identify key event dates represent we modeled expected returns using CAPM and marketing module
[280:40] We perform statistical tests on AR or CAR results. Evolve the frames.
[290:50] work easily send the multi-firm studies like momentum and size anomalies and then reflect the evidence shows at wall markets.
[300:00] Our most efficient behavior researchers can temporarily break down. So from an investment standpoint, these results are reinforced by passive investing remains dominant but it consists of
[310:10] of his heart to sustain the market digest information. So in conclusion, my finding show that use such as Serbs was in an album.
[320:20] explained. Explainable through the NOMH and behavioral finance procedures, presses do not react, but efficiency.
[330:30] largely for return as new information was absorbed. The project combined finance theory, data analytics and empirical testing.
[340:40] I'm sure you have modern market B8 under pressure. Thank you for watching my analysis on market efficiency in the games that I've case study.",,0,1

Um, my name is Evan and I'm using a new
0:07
device thing called OBS.
0:09
Um, so I'm hoping that my face is still
0:13
showing along with my code.
0:20
So here here is my collab code right
0:25
here on the side.
0:28
I hope this works. We're going to give
0:29
it a shot. Uh in this project, uh I'm
0:32
testing how efficient the stock market
0:33
really was during the 2020 2021 GameStop
0:36
short squeeze. Uh the goal is to see
0:38
whether GameStop's price movements
0:39
followed the efficient market hypothesis
0:42
or they were mainly just driven uh by
0:45
behavioral trading. The first claim I
0:47
verified was that GameStop traded at 4
0:49
cents in August 2020, which turned out
0:51
to be false. Um the actual data shows
0:54
prices around$1 to $2 per share. Um, and
0:58
my plan is to use the daily price data
1:00
for GameStop and the S&P 500 for the
1:02
Yahoo Finance. Uh, I'll estimate
1:04
GameStop's beta with the um, market
1:07
calculate
1:09
um, expected returns using the CAPM
1:11
model and finding abnormal returns,
1:12
meaning the extra gains beyond what the
1:14
theory predicts. Then I'm going to focus
1:17
on my event window between Ryan Cohen
1:20
September 2020 investment and January
1:22
2021's short squeeze peak. Uh here the
1:27
code downloads data, calculates daily
1:29
returns, estimates data or beta and um
1:32
builds the abnormal and cumulative
1:34
abnormal return series or the C. Uh
1:37
these numbers show how GameStop's price
1:40
deviated from what an efficient market
1:42
would expect. Uh next, I used a t test
1:45
on the event window to see if the
1:47
average abnormal return is statistically
1:49
different from zero. And the results
1:52
show that a significant abnormal return,
1:54
meaning that the semi- strong form of
1:56
market efficiency was was likely
1:59
violated and the prices didn't
2:01
immediately reflect all of the public
2:03
information.
2:05
Uh in this chart, the blue line right
2:07
here shows the cumulative abnormal
2:10
return skyrocketing right here around
2:13
late January
2:16
um 2021 when the Reddit community
2:20
coordinated buying the pressure in the
2:22
price and the volume chart also shows a
2:23
10-fold jump in the trading activity.
2:26
clear evidence is extreme and hurting
2:29
behavior. But overall, the weak form and
2:32
the semi- strong form of the EM EMH,
2:35
they both appear violated and uh since
2:38
trends in public news created profit
2:40
opportunities, the strong form still
2:42
kind of holds because the inside the
2:43
insiders didn't systematically profit.
2:47
Uh behavioral biases like this are they
2:50
heard mentality and FOMO. They explained
2:52
much of the frenzy, but the trading
2:54
limits and the short selling
2:56
restrictions. They also made it hard for
2:58
uh rational investors to correct the
3:00
mispricing. But um this this project
3:03
pretty much demonstrates all eight
3:05
learning goals. I tested the EMH with
3:07
real data. Uh distinguished its forms
3:10
and applied behavioral finance to um
3:13
some anomalies. um evaluated the market
3:17
uh evidence, analyzed an actual event
3:20
using the driver driver framework and I
3:22
integrated the theory with uh some data
3:24
and communicating the uh finding clearly
3:28
for the uh professional audience. Um but
3:32
this is my um this concludes my market
3:35
efficiency investigation and the
3:37
analysis shows that uh GameStop surge
3:40
was not fully efficient but um and it
3:43
was heavily heavily influenced by
3:46
behavioral forces. I also recommend if
3:48
you haven't seen the um the little show
3:52
in the little movie on Netflix about
3:54
GameStop stock, it is really really
3:56
good. Um but here is my um here's my

00:00:02.480 ider and this is my session eight
00:00:05.440 assignment. Um so starting off this is
00:00:10.880 um we're going to be investigating the
00:00:12.480 market um efficiency using GameStop
00:00:15.759 short squeeze event of 20 2020 to 2021
00:00:20.080 as a case study and verifying the
00:00:22.400 accuracy of stated facts. analyzing the
00:00:24.720 price behavior relative to the efficient
00:00:26.480 market hypothesis predictions and
00:00:28.800 evaluate whether market anomalies
00:00:31.359 constitute evidence against market
00:00:33.440 efficiency or they can be explained
00:00:35.440 without existing frameworks. Um so
00:00:39.520 that's just defining the problem. So um
00:00:42.559 we're going to use the GameStop case
00:00:44.320 study. Um, we will need historical price
00:00:47.440 data from August 2022, September 22, and
00:00:52.879 um, sorry, August 2020, September 2020,
00:00:56.399 January 2021. And then we're going to
00:00:58.719 verify specific claims um, for example,
00:01:02.000 the um, critical first step that
00:01:04.559 GameStop traded at 4 cents in August
00:01:06.880 2020. Um, and then we're also going to
00:01:09.119 analyze specific theories like E MH
00:01:12.159 versus behavioral. And then the three
00:01:15.439 forms of market efficiency is weak form.
00:01:19.040 Um prices reflect all past price and
00:01:22.479 volume information. So technical
00:01:24.640 analysis won't work here. And then semi-
00:01:26.799 strong form. So these prices reflect all
00:01:29.680 public um publicly available
00:01:31.600 information. Fundamental analysis also
00:01:33.840 doesn't work. And then strong form which
00:01:38.000 is prices reflect all information. So
00:01:41.040 including private information. So,
00:01:43.200 insider trading doesn't work. And then
00:01:46.799 the plan um for this project is this
00:01:50.960 assignment. And then I'm also going to
00:01:52.479 provide like the code that we'll be
00:01:53.920 seeing later for like the implement
00:01:55.520 stage right under it. But um our plan is
00:01:58.399 we need to get GameStop's entire price
00:02:00.880 history. So that will be seen as the get
00:02:04.719 GME data function. Also, GME is like the
00:02:08.399 stock um name on like Yahoo Finance or
00:02:11.760 anything like that um for GameStop. And
00:02:14.400 then our next um step is to tackle the
00:02:16.319 critical first step of checking if um
00:02:19.120 GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August
00:02:21.360 2020. And we're doing that by the
00:02:24.480 implement stage in verify price claim
00:02:26.720 function. And then I need the other key
00:02:29.040 data points from the timeline. So the
00:02:31.520 $483 as peak and the September 2020
00:02:37.280 price to do my analysis
00:02:40.560 and then this will be represented as
00:02:42.959 find key event prices function. Then
00:02:45.440 lastly part of my plan I need to connect
00:02:47.200 this data back to the assignments
00:02:48.560 questions in regards to EMH
00:02:52.080 and um
00:02:54.560 um behavioral and this will be shown
00:02:57.440 represented as the show evolve reflect
00:03:00.239 prompt function. Okay. So getting into
00:03:03.280 the code. Oh starting off sorry I put
00:03:05.760 this all in Gemini like the assignment
00:03:09.440 and then I put a prompt create a Python
00:03:11.599 code that answers the assignment. use
00:03:12.879 the KISS principle and driver method to
00:03:14.800 make it super easy to understand and
00:03:16.400 teach someone with little financial
00:03:17.840 knowledge. Um and then I just put it in
00:03:22.080 and it gave me the output and then here
00:03:25.200 that is.
00:03:27.599 So, um, as you can see, I just got a
00:03:31.440 Python script, and this specifically,
00:03:35.599 um, uses, um, Yahoo Finance, um, library
00:03:40.000 to gather all the information needed.
00:03:43.200 And it also uses the KISS principle
00:03:45.120 throughout to keep it um, simple and
00:03:48.080 stupid for anyone who is seeing this.
00:03:51.040 And it also goes through like a little
00:03:52.400 bit of driver as well.
00:03:54.640 Um
00:03:56.239 so as you could see I already went
00:03:57.680 through the define stage and the
00:03:59.120 represent stage and then this script is
00:04:01.439 what we're on right now and then later
00:04:03.280 on it'll um validate it throughout our
00:04:06.480 findings and also we'll get into like
00:04:08.400 reflection and evolving as well. Okay so
00:04:12.879 um starting here like I said it fetches
00:04:15.360 data from Yahoo Finance. So this is like
00:04:17.440 this section over here um about GameStop
00:04:21.440 specifically. So it will be gathering um
00:04:25.440 specifically its stock market name and
00:04:28.720 its entire history of um
00:04:34.160 oh sorry yeah uh so this is so it's this
00:04:37.600 is the Yahoo Finance like library we
00:04:39.520 like set it up within the script and
00:04:41.280 then going on to the implement stage of
00:04:43.280 the code. So the first section is we're
00:04:46.400 getting all the GameStop stock data um
00:04:49.680 through Yahoo Finance. So the first one
00:04:51.840 is just getting its stock market name.
00:04:54.240 So that's GME. The next we're getting
00:04:56.320 its entire history of its price. Um
00:04:59.759 literally the entire the entire history
00:05:01.680 of it. Um third is we're just checking
00:05:04.960 to see if all data was actually
00:05:06.720 retrieved at the end making sure there
00:05:08.800 was no errors and if there was it would
00:05:10.720 print an error message and then also a
00:05:13.520 success message if it was good. And then
00:05:18.320 um we return the data so that other
00:05:20.160 functions can use it as well. And then
00:05:24.880 then oh yeah then we're going to go on
00:05:27.520 to the next section. This is going to
00:05:30.320 print um this is the critical first step
00:05:34.800 from the assignment. So seeing if it's
00:05:36.479 actually the 4 cents in 2020. So, like I
00:05:40.400 said, um text the price in 2020 and it's
00:05:43.520 going to validate if GameStop traded at
00:05:45.600 4 cents in August. So, starting off, we
00:05:48.800 will be um defining the range we care
00:05:52.320 about. So, August 1st to August 31st in
00:05:56.320 2020.
00:05:57.840 And then it's going to be grabbing all
00:06:00.400 the data within the rows in that date
00:06:03.440 range. And then it's going to be finding
00:06:06.639 also the lowest and highest price within
00:06:09.919 that month. And it's going to print our
00:06:12.240 findings as well. And then um it's just
00:06:16.400 going to format it nicely as well. And
00:06:19.440 then we're checking the 4% claim
00:06:24.319 um whether it's like likely on the
00:06:26.960 pre-split or the post-split and all that
00:06:29.759 stuff.
00:06:31.520 And then
00:06:34.160 moving on to the next function that's
00:06:39.039 going to find is going to find key
00:06:40.800 prices from the timeline to help with
00:06:42.800 the rest of the analysis. So we're going
00:06:45.840 to be finding the um the peak price in
00:06:49.039 January 2021. So the range would be from
00:06:52.720 January 1st to January 31st in 2021. And
00:06:56.240 then it's also going to find the price
00:06:59.440 uh around September 2020 for Ryan Cohen.
00:07:04.319 Like I said, September 1st to September
00:07:06.479 30th in 2020. And then it's going to
00:07:10.000 print that. And then lastly, it's going
00:07:12.319 to um this whole kiss section. This is
00:07:16.479 just printing like the questions that
00:07:18.639 we're going to be answering um at the
00:07:20.720 end in like the evolve and like reflect
00:07:23.599 section with like some of the answers as
00:07:26.160 well. And then down here is just a to-do
00:07:29.360 list of what we're just going to cover.
00:07:31.680 So the define and represent and then the
00:07:35.120 implement with like grabbing the
00:07:36.800 implement and validating again like I
00:07:38.720 said just grabbing GameStop's data
00:07:40.800 validating and making sure it's actually
00:07:42.639 4% traded in August. Um, and then the
00:07:46.880 key key events on the timeline and then
00:07:49.599 finally our and discussion.
00:07:52.960 Okay, I'm gonna run this.
00:07:55.440 Awesome. It worked. Um,
00:07:59.039 so going off of this.
00:08:02.879 Let me scroll on this side. So, I ran
00:08:04.720 the script. Um, so the one thing we
00:08:09.039 really wanted to do was validate whether
00:08:12.720 GameStop traded at 4% in I mean 4 cents
00:08:15.919 in August 2020. So this scripts output
00:08:20.400 clearly shows the claim that GameStop
00:08:23.680 traded at four at 4 cents in August 2020
00:08:28.080 is incorrect.
00:08:30.080 Um,
00:08:32.080 and um,
00:08:35.120 oh yeah, it says it right here for you
00:08:36.958 to see.
00:08:38.719 And then it also shows like the highest
00:08:40.958 and lowest range, which is what I was
00:08:42.479 talking about before. Um,
00:08:45.920 and yeah, so the actual like lowest
00:08:48.800 price in August 2020 was, let me scroll
00:08:53.120 a little bit. Um, the actual price in
00:08:55.200 August 2020 was $41.
00:08:59.839 So this price is the post stock split.
00:09:03.360 So the original claim could have been um
00:09:06.080 based on a different data source or it
00:09:08.720 was a typo. And it found that the lowest
00:09:11.279 price was $1 and the highest was $1.79
00:09:18.240 um during August 2020.
00:09:21.519 So um then moving on to this part, this
00:09:26.880 just identifies um the peak price in
00:09:29.279 January 2021 as
00:09:32.800 127 I mean $120.75
00:09:36.959 on January 28th, 2021. It also notes the
00:09:41.839 difference with the assignments $483.
00:09:46.320 um the claim explaining that this would
00:09:48.000 be due to the pre-market or intraday
00:09:51.279 highs not captured by the high column um
00:09:55.600 in the daily data. It also provides
00:09:59.519 um the average closing price in
00:10:01.440 September 2020 as $2.13
00:10:06.240 which is relevant to um understanding
00:10:09.040 the stock price before the major short
00:10:11.760 squeeze event.
00:10:14.240 And then
00:10:16.160 um also
00:10:21.040 um
00:10:23.440 yeah, so the script's data just like
00:10:25.200 perfectly validates that the $483
00:10:28.480 claim is demonstrating a correct
00:10:30.399 understanding of the split adjusted
00:10:33.519 data.
00:10:35.040 And then moving on to the fun stuff. So
00:10:41.360 talking about um oh these were all the
00:10:44.160 like the questions that I was talking
00:10:45.600 about like in the prompts from the
00:10:47.519 before. So the market efficiency was
00:10:50.720 this violated. Um so this is the
00:10:54.959 validated data um strongly challenges
00:10:58.079 the semi- strong and strong form while
00:11:00.959 the weak form was most likely held. So
00:11:03.920 the weak form um which was held this
00:11:07.920 form says that you can't predict future
00:11:09.760 prices by looking at past prices. So
00:11:12.320 technical analysis doesn't work. The um
00:11:15.680 GameStop spike was sudden and external
00:11:19.680 event driven by social media not a
00:11:22.880 predictable pattern from its um past
00:11:25.279 price chart. And then um no standard
00:11:29.680 technical model would have predicted it.
00:11:32.000 So the weak form holds in the past
00:11:34.640 prices are useless.
00:11:37.920 And then for semi strong this was
00:11:40.880 obviously violated. Um this form just
00:11:44.079 says all public information instantly
00:11:46.560 reflected in the price and this is the
00:11:50.640 most obvious violation. And then um
00:11:52.959 there was like public news like Ryan
00:11:55.200 Cohen um disclosed his 13% stake in
00:11:58.320 September 2020.
00:12:00.399 And then also data from like my script
00:12:03.120 is it shows the price in September 2020
00:12:05.839 was only around $160 to $2.70 which is
00:12:10.000 split adjusted. Um and then the market
00:12:13.279 did not instantly price
00:12:16.399 in this major public news and it took 4
00:12:18.720 months into social media frenzy for the
00:12:21.360 price to react. So this 4 month lag is a
00:12:25.760 massive violation.
00:12:28.959 This is obviously said it in like a
00:12:31.440 shorter version than I just did, but um
00:12:34.399 for the strong form um this form just
00:12:37.440 says all information public and private
00:12:39.440 is in the price and no one can beat the
00:12:41.200 market. This is almost always considered
00:12:43.920 false, but GameStop is obviously a great
00:12:46.639 example. And the private information was
00:12:50.320 the collective plan in sentiment
00:12:52.720 building within the um community for um
00:12:58.320 for a time. Also, the group did
00:13:01.839 um did beat the market, proving that
00:13:03.839 this private knowledge had value at some
00:13:07.519 point. And then moving on to
00:13:12.480 whether
00:13:14.079 um could rational investors have
00:13:15.600 profited systematically.
00:13:17.680 So um systematically means um
00:13:20.560 reliability over and over. Could you
00:13:22.639 have known to buy in September 2020 and
00:13:25.279 sell at 483? And could you have known
00:13:28.160 when to get out? Um is this a one time
00:13:31.279 thing, not a system? Um so could a
00:13:35.120 rational investor profit systematically?
00:13:36.880 No. a rational investor could not profit
00:13:40.079 systematically. Um, systematically just
00:13:42.639 implies repeatable, reliable,
00:13:45.360 riskadjusted strategy. And the GameStop
00:13:47.920 event was very chaotic in a one time per
00:13:51.440 stock event driven by the social media
00:13:53.920 frenzy, not really a system. And then
00:13:57.040 looking back, it's easy to say like buy
00:13:59.279 in September and sell in January. Um,
00:14:04.959 so you really couldn't have known. Um,
00:14:08.000 rationality versus speculation. So
00:14:10.399 looking forward like a rational investor
00:14:12.720 must weigh risk and buying GameStop in
00:14:15.440 December 2020 was pure speculation, not
00:14:18.959 a strategy. And then you had no way to
00:14:21.680 know if January 28th was the peak or
00:14:24.320 just the beginning.
00:14:26.000 um the risk of a total collapse was
00:14:28.320 enormous and um enormous at every second
00:14:32.639 and there was also no exit signal. There
00:14:35.040 was no rational quot system to tell you
00:14:37.839 when to sell. So the people who profited
00:14:40.079 did so through luck, timing and just
00:14:42.560 speculation, not a repeatable system.
00:14:46.079 And then moving on to the last section,
00:14:48.560 what behavioral finance explanations
00:14:50.639 fit? So hurting
00:14:53.440 um everyone on Wall Street bets buy
00:14:56.720 spying at once overconfidence believing
00:14:58.560 that the stock could only go up to the
00:15:00.240 moon limits to um arbitrage which didn't
00:15:04.800 rational investors short it at $483.
00:15:09.920 Um so going on to that hurting this is
00:15:13.040 the most obvious. Millions of individual
00:15:15.360 investors coordinate on the Wall Street
00:15:17.920 forum. Um all did the same action which
00:15:20.480 was buy GameStop at the same time. Um
00:15:23.760 which is this the definition of hurting
00:15:26.000 behavior buying at once.
00:15:28.720 Um overconfidence. So the narratives on
00:15:33.360 the forum like diamond hands which means
00:15:36.079 like they never sell and like to the
00:15:37.760 moon which means the price will go to
00:15:39.760 infinity are classic examples. Um
00:15:42.720 investors become overconfident in their
00:15:46.240 us versus them narrative ignoring the
00:15:49.360 company's actual um fundamentals which
00:15:52.480 were poor at the time and the immense
00:15:55.680 risk of a crash. So the li the limits to
00:15:58.959 arbitrage this is the most important
00:16:01.680 financial con concept. It just means um
00:16:05.600 when rational investors correct a wrong
00:16:08.800 price. So by short selling an
00:16:11.199 overstocked um an overpriced stock. So
00:16:14.560 the price of GameStop was wrong and it
00:16:16.959 was not worth $483.
00:16:19.360 So why didn't rational why didn't
00:16:22.959 rational investors fix it? it's because
00:16:25.920 it was too risky and then um the
00:16:29.120 arbitrageers, the hedge funds like
00:16:31.040 Milton Capital, they were trying to
00:16:33.360 short it and um they just became
00:16:36.240 bankrupt by the hurting of the retail
00:16:39.360 and so the risk of unlimited losses from
00:16:41.839 shorting and the cost of borrowing the
00:16:43.519 stock were so high that the rational
00:16:45.360 trade became impossible. And this is a
00:16:48.399 limit to arbitrage which allowed the
00:16:50.800 wrong price to exist for a short time.
00:16:54.720 And then um
00:16:58.480 ending things off like reflecting on
00:17:00.800 this assignment. So the GameStop event
00:17:04.160 shows that the market is not a simple
00:17:06.559 efficient machine. It's a complex system
00:17:09.599 driven by both rational analysis and
00:17:12.079 powerful behavioral forces. And then the
00:17:16.160 EMH is a useful baseline, but it's
00:17:18.480 incomplete. So behavioral finance is
00:17:21.039 essential for explaining um anomalies
00:17:23.679 like this which are becoming more common
00:17:26.240 in the age of social media. And then
00:17:28.880 this lastly this event shows that while
00:17:31.280 passive investing like index funds is
00:17:34.720 smart for most there is a clear rule for
00:17:37.440 active management that understands
00:17:39.039 market structure sentiment and it also
00:17:41.840 limits to arbitrage. But that is it and
00:17:46.480 thank you guys for listening.

um and this is session 8 assignment
0:10
um we're supposed to investigate market
0:11
eventually using the GameStop um GME
0:14
short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021
0:19
and then for the first part for divine
0:21

initial data requirements our primary
0:28
goal of this um case studies to
0:30
investigate the GME short squeeze to ac
0:33
assess market efficiency and evaluate
0:36
the role of behavioral finance. Some key
0:38
questions to ask was the initial price
0:40
statement of for cents in August 2020
0:42
accurate? Which form of EMH was
0:45
potentially violated? And could a
0:47
rational investor have generated
0:49
systematic risk adjustment abnormal
0:51
returns?
0:53
Um
0:55
and then discover an initial data check.
0:59
um immediately create create a reliable
1:02
financial data source for GME's
1:04
historical trading data from August 2020
1:06
and then we're supposed to verify the
1:08
accuracy of the 4 cents in August 2020
1:12
but the actual price was likely the to
1:14
the $4 to $6 range so it was um
1:18
incorrect
1:20
4 cents next step is to represent
1:24
um our data requirements and acquisition
1:26
plan data points um gi price and volume.
1:29
Um, S&P 500 or Russell 2000 market
1:32
returns for abnormal return calculation,
1:34
the historical short interest data for
1:36
GME and the relevant news social media

testing use auto auto correction of

daily returns and risk test to check for

2:00
supposed to identify map behavioral
2:02
biases hurting available bias and
2:04
confirmation bias.
2:07
for the I we're supposed to execute the
2:09
plain analytical models using the
2:11
acquired data and Python code. Um
2:15
and then if we we have this code down
2:17
here um
2:21
here's all the code
2:24
um over here. Um if we look at some
2:29
individual things
2:31
um
2:33
the the code gene analysis pon py uh
2:38
load loads the necessary libraries y to
2:41
download data um for the man manipul
2:46
manipulation for plotting um some other
2:49
ones fetch and verify data it's fetching
2:52
data from other websites like fan
2:54
finance and figuring out um
2:59
like uh the different
3:03
prices like GameStop traded at 4 cents
3:05
in August 2020 but that was incorrect is
3:07
an incorrect statement. Usually it
3:09
traded at between $4 to $6 range. And
3:13
then the calculate returns is just
3:15
calculating um in finance log returns
3:18
are preferred over simple returns
3:20
because they're additive making
3:22
cumulative calculations easier and
3:23
better approximate continuous
3:24
compounding. Um as we move on to um the
3:30
Eve portion of driver um the EMH
3:33
violation conclusion the strongest
3:34
conclusion the event primary primarily
3:36
violated the semi- strong form EMH
3:39
because the price 483 severely deviated
3:43
from the public fundamental value to 10
3:44
to 40 range. Um weak form check if the
3:47
time series analysis showed non-random
3:49
returns during an event. It also points
3:51
for a weak form violation. Um the strong
3:54
form check the fact that insiders um and
3:57
retail traders had information
3:59
coordination not available to the
4:00
general public or institutions suggest a
4:02
violation of strong form efficiency as
4:03
well. Um for the behavioral finance
4:07
assessment hurting in social media
4:08
conclude that the GM event is classic
4:11
example of crowd behavior driven by
4:13
social media. The large volume spikes
4:15
confirm hurting um the rational investor
4:19
profitability conclusion. Expost looking
4:21
backwards systematic profit was possible
4:24
for lows with superior information or
4:26
coordination. However, X anti-
4:28
irrational risk averse investor could
4:31
not have real reliably predicted timing
4:33
or magnitude of the squeeze thus
4:35
preventing systematic risk adjustment
4:37
profit. The high volatility implies the
4:39
risk returns came from unacceptably high
4:42
risk.
4:43
Now for the R report and refine key
4:47
takeaways, the GMA short squeeze
4:48
represents a severe short-lived semi-
4:50
strong market anomaly driven by
4:51
combination of high short interest and
4:53
social mediadriven hurting behaviors. Um
4:57
while EMH defines the price
5:01
um the framework preference while EMH
5:03
defines the price as a massive
5:04
mispricing the behavioral fire finance
5:06
framework is better equipped to explain
5:08
the mechanism duration of anomaly the
5:10
hurting plus limits to arbitrage
5:13
um policy implications. The event
5:15
highlights the need for reviewing rules
5:17
around short selling disclosure trade
5:19
settlement times and the ability of
5:20
brokerages to restrict trading. Some
5:23
limitations in future work. Um some
5:25
limitations. The current analysis based
5:26
on daily data. Intraday data would
5:29
provide deeper insight into the speed of
5:33
um of price changes. Statistical
5:36
significance testing was optional. So
5:37
it's basic here. Uh the refinement
5:39
future work could involve building a
5:41
regress a regression model to more
5:44
rigorously estimate the expected return
5:47
and calculate abnormal returns with

",FALSE,1,"Okay. Okay. There we go. Uh, hello. My name is Trevor Squire and this is my session 8 assignment on market efficiency investigation. So, a little bit of an overview. Um, I'm supposed to investigate market efficiency using GameStop um, short squeeze event of 2020 2021 as a case study. I am supposed to verify the accuracy of the facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies sorry excuse me and evaluate whether market anomaly anomal anomalies um constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So I given my event timeline, key data points and required analysis and just some questions I have to answer. So I have everything organized. Um I have the assignment description tab, Gemini right here with the collab code, collab with the code, and then lastly the notes that I will be using to talk about. Um so yeah, I'm just going to get right into it cuz this is going to be a very long one. I'm going to be honest. I put a lot of um detail into this and I also have some notes on the collab I'm going to talk about. Um so first to find and discover. So my main goal is to look at the um 2020 2021 GameStop um short squeeze as a case study for the efficient market hypothesis. So main questions I have to answer um fast check um is the GameStop first like look in the statement um GameStop traded the 4 cents in August 2020 um or $04. I was supposed to see if that's true. Um, EMH violation. Which forms a market efficiency? Weak, semi-strong, strong seem to have been violated. Profitability. Could a rational investor by the EMH definition have actually made money from this? EMH versus reality. How do the predictions um from EMH stack up against what really happened with the GME price? Um, and then alternative explanations. do behavioral finance ideas um like her behavior or FOMO do a better job of explaining it. So discover um first thing I do was check if this was fact. Um so I just searched up Doomst stock price August 2020 and what I found multiple reliable financial sites like Yahoo um Finance, Bloomberg, etc. and even SEC filings all have confirmed that GME did not trade um that amount in August 2020. Back in August 2020, GME stock price was in the range of $4 to $6.50. So the statement gave stock trade at 4 cents is totally wrong by a factor of 100. So the huge error and changes the So this huge error and changes the nearby bankruptcy story. So the price was low. It's $4 650. Um it is low but not fractions of a penny low. Next represent um so I planned out how tackle the full analysis based on what I found. Um so my main plan part one how to handle the data error. So I'll state clearly um that the four cents is wrong. I'll give the correct price range and mention like my historical data to show it's accurate. How I tell the professor? Um, dear professor, while doing the um critical first step the assignment, I found a um error in the August 2020 price in the amount list at 4 cents, but historical data from uh sources like Yahoo Finance um and SEC's own report showed that um it was actually in the $4 to $5 price range. I just want to verify if I should proceed with the correct historical data or if the figure was intended to be hypothetical. So it's the reason why I say this it's not confrontational shows I did the work it just I just asked for clarification part two um which is literally answer the rest of the questions. So how was EMA violated versus weak form? I'll check if past um price or volume data which is public could have been used to predict the squeeze. Um, the Wall Street Bets community did use historical price and more importantly public short interest data to predict the squeeze. So, this looks like a yes. Um, the semi- strong form I'll check if the price reflected all public info. So, this looks like um the biggest violation the price which was $483 had nothing to do with the company's actual value like um like earnings. Um the 140% um wow 1440% short interest was public info and the market's reaction um first ignoring it then you're reacting shows the price wasn't efficient. Lastly strong form I'll check if private info was involved. This seems like less important because the whole thing was driven by public post and data not inside tips. Um next is could a rational investor have made money. First, I'll define a rational investor, which is someone who believes the price reflects the company's true value. This kind of investor would have thought GME was way overpriced at $50 or even $100 and definitely $400. They would not have bought. What about shorting it? Um, yes, this wasn't a systematic profit. Uh, shorting at $50 rational move um would have wiped them out before the price ever came back down. The profit was made by speculators betting on market mechanics and irrationality, not by rational investors. What EMH predicted versus what actually happened. So prediction price should um just randomly walk around its real value. Reality the price went crazy driven by social media feedback loop and market mechanics. short covering then using um behavioral finance to explain it. This framework seems way more useful here versus her behavior. The um Wall Street bets phenomenon overconfidence bias. Uh retail retail traders thinking they could beat the hedge funds. Prospect theory/fomo. People buying at $100 or $200 weren't buying on the value. They were just scared of missing out. And then finally, narrative economics. The David versus Goliath story was a powerful motivator that had nothing to do with financial data. Next is implement. Uh I'm going to do the analysis and writing the answers as they will be in the assignment. So analysis of the GameStop short squeeze verification stated facts. Again, critical step. Uh as required, I first checked the statement. GameStop traded at four 4 cents in August 2020. This is factually incorrect. After reviewing historical data from say Yah from Yahoo Finance and SEC reports, I can confirm GME split adjusted price in August 2020 was in the range of $4 to $6.50. The 4 cents figure is off by a factor of 100. I'll use the correct historical data for the rest of my analysis. Which parts are violated? Weak form efficiency violation likely. This one says you can't use past price and volume data to predict future prices. The GME event challenges this. The whole Wall Street Bets idea was based on public data. The low star price, the crazy high short interest 40% a float. They use this public data to predict a short squeeze and the price explosion um prove them right at least at first. Semi- strong form efficiency very clear violation. This is the clearest violation. It says prices um should reflect all public info instantly. The GME um price completely disconnected from any public facts. Fundamentals public um analyst estimates said G wow public analyst estimates said GME was worth $10 to $40. The price hitting $483 shows this info is being ignored. Short interest the 140% short interest was public. Inefficient market might have bumped the price up to fix this. Instead of the market ignored it then violently overreacted. Next is strong form efficiency which is not primary This like that all private info priced in wasn't the main issue. The squeeze was driven by a mass coordination of retail traders acting on public data and sentiment not inside information.

Question. Could a rational investor have profited? A rational investor by EMH definition trust that prices reflect true value. Such an investor would have concluded GME was overvalued as it passed $40, $50 and $100. They would not have purchased the stock. Could they have profited by short selling? No. If they shorted the stock at $50, which would be the rational move, they would have gone bankrupt. Then the price has soared to $483. the price the timing was impossible to predict. So therefore systematic profit for a rational investor was impossible. The people who profited or speculators who correctly bet that irrationally would win out in the short term. This is or market mechanics. Fourth is EMH predictor pred.
Okay, hello again. Um, so EMH prediction prices should reflect the um company's value. Uh, new info like Ryan Cohen buying in should should cause a price adjustment from like $6 $15 and then the price should go back into the random block. Observe behavior. The price became doubled from the value. It wasn't driven by new info about GameStop's business, but by info about other traders, the short interest. Um, this created a feedback loop where buying just created more buying a bubble, which is the opposite of EMH.

So, explaining with behavior finance, honestly, behavioral finance explains this way better than EMH. Um, her herd behavior and social proof. Millions of investors coordining on uh Wall Street bets created a herd that felt safe in numbers. FOMO, fear of missing out. As prices shot up, people bought in just because they were afraid of missing the massive gains. Availability cascade. The D versus GL story was everywhere on social media and became a powerful narrative that drove buying regardless of the financial data. Uh short squeeze market mechanics. This is the technical uh spark. It's not a behavioral idea but it was a cataly catalyst. Yeah. And all the behavioral factors fanned into a fire. So next is verification checking my worst against original goals. Uh fact check for sense yes corrected. EMH violation yes analyze all three rational profit. Yes. Concluded it was not possible. AMH versus reality. Yes. Contrasted behavioral finance. Yes. assessed framework tech driver framework. Yes, I did um I did DNR before I um how strong my analysis I think is very strong. I correctly point to the semi- strong form as the main violation. It separated rational investors from speculators.

So then a little bit of evolve and reflect. Um so things to fix or improve fix the four cents fact. This is the most important thing. The analysis is non uh nonsense without it. Um be clear about the squeeze versus the bubble. So I can improve the paper by separating the event in two phases. Phase one, the short squeeze. Um a mechanical event based on a somewhat rational high-risisk trade buying stock to for shorts with greater than 100% short interest to cover. Phase two, the FOMO bubble, which was late January 2021. a behavioral event where the price surged way beyond what squeeze required driven by her behavior in media type. So why does this matter? I could argue phase one was a risky efficient punishment for the market for the market or the market ignoring the 140% short interest while phase two was pure irrationality. And these are some extra extra ideas I want to throw in. There's the gamma squeeze. So the assignment didn't mention options but they were a huge deal. A gamma squeeze is when massive purchases or of call options the right to buy stock force the people who sell the options market makers to buy the actual stock to hedge their bet. This buying from market makers adds rocket fuel to the price creating a feedback loop. Prices rise more more call options are bought. Market makers buy more GME stock. Prices rise even faster. Adding this will make my analysis look much more thorough. There's the Robin Hood market uh structure mess. I could discuss the trading restrictions. Why did Robin Hood and others suddenly halt buying and not selling? Um this gets into the weeds of market structure, clear house collateral, T plus2 settlement, etc., etc., PFO. Um an argument. Some people argued this was rigged system violating strong uh form efficiency since powerful players acted on non-public decisions. The official reason was the brokers couldn't meet the cloud requirements from the volatility. This is a very high level point to add. Lastly, SEC report. Oh, sorry, not not lastly. Next is SEC report. To make this look really well researched, I should reference the official staff report on equity and options market structure conditions early 2021. Uh SEC said the volatality was not caused by a single issue, but rather a convergence of factors including a game of squeeze and high shot interest. They didn't find evidence of manipulation, but they did point out the risk of social media driven her behavior. Last conclusion about long-term versus short-term efficiency. A good concluding thought would be the GME event shows that while markets can be very inefficient in the short term like bubbles happen, they tend to be efficient in the long term. The GME price didn't stay at $483, it eventually crashed back down showing the fundamental value act like a center of gravity. Let me just double check my time so I can see if I can do two. Okay, perfect. Five minutes. So, next I'm going to go into the collab script walkthrough. I'm going to be very quick so I have enough time for it to be two videos. So I have my Gemini here with all the data which I then put into Collab here. I was going to do a quick run through of Collab. So first is the um PIP install Y Finance. Um first I have to install the Y Finance library. The exclamation point just tells Collabad to run this as a terminal command. I need this library because it's what lets me pull all the historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance. Oh no, I didn't pause it, did I? Okay, sorry, I forgot this thing pops up. So, right here, the exclamation commands and the work to install packages. Um, pip install Y fin Finance. Next is import Y Finance as YF and import pandas as PD. Here I'm importing the libraries I'll need. I give Y fin Finance a nickname Y F and pandas a nickname PD uh pandas are pandas is great for organizing the into a table which Y finance gives me it makes it really easy to work with and that is right here next is the oh yeah next is the ticker um so this line where I tell script I'm interested in games using its official stock symbol GME which is right here to find the stock ticker equals GME ticker equals YF ticker ticker symbol. I really don't like saying that word, I'm not going to lie. Um, historical data. So, this is the main command. I'm telling the GMBB object to get its history for the specific dates, start date, end date. It grabs all the day, all the daily data, uh, open, high, low, etc. Uh, for August 2020, saves it in my historical data variable. The best part is the day is automatically split adjusted which is why I need for accurate historical comparison. So that is define the data range. Here are the dates and then it fetches the historical data. Um data was automatically split adjusted which is what we want for accurate historical comparison. And then next is the price data equals historical data low high um price data. So I make a smaller cleaner table called price data that only has the low and high columns since that's where all I care about this fact checked. I print this table so I can show the exact daily prices as my primary evidence. This table clearly shows the prices aren't anywhere near the 4 cents. So these this is step five display revival data and then the low and high prices to verify the range and then find the absolute minimum maximum for that month. So that's the next part. So I just find the single lowest, the minimum from the low column, and then the single highest from the maximum column for the whole month, which is right here. And then lastly is the lowest price min lowest price um minimum low print. So finally print my conclusion. I use an S string. Who's texting me? Okay. Finally, I put my conclusion. I use a string. Yeah. at the beginning to put my uh minimum, low, maximum, high variables right into the sentence. The 2F makes the makes sure the money wait the 2F just makes sure it looks like money um two decimal places. So, it gives me the final clear summary that proves that f the price was in the $4 to $6 range and that the 4 cents um was incorrect. So, that's the very end here. This is the conclusion and yeah um perfect. I got one minute left. That is pretty much it for this assignment. Um I wanted to again add more data for the collab because a lot of times I'm reading it, I don't understand it. So I asked Gemini to um give me the collab and then create give me this short description for each tab. So I helps me better understand it. But yeah, um Gemini was definitely a big help for this assignment. Um, I get as I found a lot easier since there were less numbers, not a lot of math to calculate. It was just more historical data and research, which I actually like doing. So, I got to say I really like this assignment. But yeah, that's pretty much it. And thank you for listening.",,0,1

Hi everyone, my name is Sharanya and um
0:04
in this project I analyzed the market
0:07
efficiency of the 2020 2021 GameStop
0:11
short squeeze using the drivers
0:12
framework. So basically today I'm going
0:15
to walk through each of the drivers
0:17
stage in order and show how the data,
0:21
the code and my graphs support my
0:23
conclusion.
0:25
So in the define stage um I set up the
0:28
core research problem. So in this um our
0:32
prompt gave several factual cla claims
0:35
about GameStop.
0:37
Um
0:39
but before doing any of the analysis I
0:41
needed to verify the accuracy of these
0:43
statements and our most important one
0:46
because it can change the entire
0:47
narrative was GameStop traded at 4 cents
0:52
in August 2020.
0:55
Um and so my first research question
0:59
became became is that statement actually
1:02
true? Then I defined the broader more
1:06
analytical questions. Um how did GME
1:08
prices and volume behave around major
1:10
events like the Ryan Cohen stake
1:12
announcement, the January 2021 short
1:15
squeeze peak and the congressional
1:17
hearing? Two, what do abnormal returns
1:20
around those events tell us about weak
1:22
form and semi- strong form market
1:25
efficiency? Three, did statistically
1:27
significant abnormal returns exist and
1:30
could rational investors systematically
1:33
exploit them? Four, how do behavioral
1:36
biases like hurting, overconfidence, and
1:39
FOMO explain the extreme market behavior
1:42
that we saw?
1:44
So in the discover stage I collected
1:47
clean historical data um and using
1:50
Python and the Y finance library I
1:54
downloaded the daily price and volume
1:56
data for GME and for the S&P 500 proxy
2:00
spy from 2019 to the present. So, this
2:04
gave me 1,727
2:07
observations, adjusted close prices,
2:10
volume data, and enough pre-event
2:12
history to build proper estimation
2:13
windows. Here is my um
2:18
notebook output
2:22
right over here.
2:24
Starts over here,
2:27
right? Perfect.
2:29
um with you can see the merged data set
2:32
with the GME prices
2:35
and um volume on the left and spy prices
2:38
on the right.
2:42
In the represent stage, I designed my
2:45
analytical plan. Basically, my blueprint
2:48
for how the study event would work. Um I
2:50
plan to compute log returns for GME in
2:53
the market. Use a 110day estimation
2:55
window before each event to estimate the
2:57
CA capm alpha and beta. Define a 21
3:02
event um window like 10 day trend 10
3:07
trading days before and after each event
3:09
that we have. Four, calculate the
3:12
abnormal returns and the cumulative
3:14
abnormal returns. And then five, test
3:18
how extreme and statistically
3:20
significant um the cumulative abnormal
3:23
returns were.
3:25
So my three main events were August
3:28
31st, 2020, Ryan Gohan takes a stake,
3:31
Jan January 27, 2021, short squeeze peak
3:36
near $483.
3:38
And February 18th, 2021, the
3:41
congressional hearing. So this step made
3:44
sure my implementation had structure and
3:46
it wasn't just a random analysis. So
3:49
implement this is where the coding
3:51
happened. Um first of all I fact checked
3:55
the um 4 cents claim. So the code
3:59
filtered August 2020 prices and found
4:02
our minimum prices to be $14 and our max
4:07
price to be $167.
4:10
So the statement is completely false and
4:13
um here is the graph that showed the
4:15
actual August trend August 2020 trend
4:19
and
4:21
over here as you can see um this would
4:24
need to be corrected politely by showing
4:26
the actual split adjusted figures.
4:29
Um number two our estimation of the CAPM
4:34
parameters. So for each event, my code
4:36
estimated the alpha and the beta.
4:42
Um
4:43
for example, Ryan Gohan's event was the
4:46
alpha was 0.00.6
4:50
and the beta was 1.02.
4:54
Uh
4:56
as we can as we have written right over
4:58
here, our short squeeze peak the alpha
5:02
was 0.0125.
5:05
and our beta was 1.77.
5:10
And here are the graphs for
5:13
both.
5:15
And these high betas confirm that G um
5:18
confirmed GME was already extremely
5:22
volatile heading into the squeeze.
5:25
So,
5:28
um, looking back up to our
5:32
abnormal returns and the Ryan Cohen
5:35
stake, there is a large positive
5:38
abnormal return on the event day. Our
5:41
the C rises sharply to about 045,
5:46
meaning 45% of abnormal performance in
5:49
the window. So, that's statistically
5:52
significant. Our T stat is around 23. So
5:55
this suggests a semi strong EMH
5:58
violation.
6:01
Um
6:03
next we have the short squeeze peak.
6:06
So
6:08
our AR
6:12
spikes massively right before the peak.
6:14
Our car reaches around 2.5 or 250% of
6:20
normal return.
6:22
um followed by an extremely negative
6:24
equally extremely negative ARS and this
6:27
volatility is not explainable by
6:31
rational pricing.
6:35
Then um we have our congressional
6:38
hearing.
6:39
So
6:41
our alpha for this is 0.01772
6:46
and our beta is 1.85.
6:49
Um, so it shows that the pre-event car
6:52
is negative. The event day shows a sharp
6:55
positive AR and the postevent car turns
6:58
upward. So this behavior again looks
7:02
like it's influenced by sentiment, not
7:04
the fundamentals.
7:07
And then um
7:09
here is my last screenshot sorry graph.
7:14
Um in January 2021
7:17
uh where is January 2020? There we go.
7:20
In January 2021 the average daily volume
7:24
jumped from about 26 million all the way
7:29
up to 265 million. So that is around a
7:32
9.9 times. It increased nearly 10 times.
7:36
Sorry. So, this is a classic hurting
7:38
behavior amplified by social media
7:41
especially um by Wall Street bets.
7:47
Last um then we have validate. So now
7:49
invalidate I evaluated evaluated sorry
7:53
whether the abnormal returns were
7:55
statistically meaningful or not. So from
7:57
the output table we can see that Ryan co
8:01
Ryan Cohen's car t stat was 23.0. Um
8:07
um
8:09
our the squeeze peak car t stat was
8:11
about 6.6
8:14
and um the congressional hearings car
8:17
stat was about.77.
8:21
Um so this basically means that the
8:23
first two events show highly significant
8:26
abnormal returns far beyond what the
8:29
semi- strong EMH would follow u sorry
8:32
would allow. Um the hearings event is
8:37
mildly positive but not a statistically
8:39
extreme. So this validates that the
8:42
market did not efficiently in um
8:45
incorporate
8:46
um information especially during the
8:49
short squeeze
8:51
in the evolve stage. I connected my
8:53
empirical findings to investment
8:55
implications.
8:57
So when I compared postsque squeeze
8:59
returns um it showed that GME fell down
9:03
to -65.
9:06
It fell to um 65% from February 2021 to
9:10
um February 2022
9:12
and our SPY rose to a positive 24%. So
9:18
this is a dramatic mean reversion. So
9:22
while the inefficiencies existed, they
9:24
were not reliably exploitable by our
9:28
rational investors because short sellers
9:31
faced unlimited risk. Broke brokers
9:35
sorry uh restricted trading and um
9:38
borrow fees and liquidity constraints
9:40
were extreme. So this falls under the
9:42
limit under the limits to arbitrage
9:45
concept.
9:47
Finally, in the reflect stage, I looked
9:49
back at the entire analysis. So, this
9:52
event shows a clash between EMH, EMH,
9:56
and behavioral finance. Um, there's a
9:59
weak form efficiency was violated
10:01
because the prices showed massive
10:03
massive predictable momentum. Um, the
10:06
semi strong form was violated because
10:08
public news did not incorporate um
10:11
smoothly. So, um the prices overreacted
10:13
wildly.
10:15
strong form was definitely violated
10:17
since hedge funds themselves were caught
10:19
off guard. Um behavioral factors like
10:23
herd behavior, FOMO, narrative trading
10:26
and social mediadriven coordination
10:28
explain the explosive car patterns and
10:31
volume spikes for better trai better
10:34
sorry um volume spikes far better than
10:38
traditional EMH and overall a realam GME
10:43
is a real example of a market behaving
10:46
irrationally not efficiently.
10:49
So um thank you for watching my
10:52
analysis. Um using drivers helped me
10:55
structure my thinking clearly from
10:57
defining the problem that we had to
10:59
validating and reflecting on the results
11:00
that we get from the code.
11:03
Um, thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and today
this is the session 8 video assignment.
So here in this scenario, it says that
we've spent weeks analyzing GameStop
using every technique from sessions one
through six previously
and our CAPM based valuation shows
intrinsic value of $12 per share, but
the stock is trading at $200 currently.
And in our mind, we come up with three
explanations for that.
First one is just that we're wrong
simply just a user error and that our
analysis may have missed something
important.
Your second option is oh you know maybe
the market is wrong and that the
fundamental analysis reveals there was
some sort of mispricing.
And your third explanation is just, you
know, markets are weird, prices reflect
psychology as much as fundamentals at
this point. So, which one of these seems
to be the most accurate?
So for the specific case of this
GameStop
um scenario,
the most accurate explanation in my
opinion
would be a combination
of the second explanation as well as the
third.
And since the the price was pretty
clearly like a bubble, which is kind of
what explanation 2 is about,
um, it has like some unique behavioral
biases
and it also has some like market
dynamics with those biases, which is
basically what the third explanation is
trying to get at.
So,
I don't think this one is correct.
Um, it just
it's completely overridden by like the
market mechanics and psychology thing.
So, I personally believe it is a mix of
these two right here.",,0,1

Today we are going to do our session 8
0:03
weekly assignment. So first we're going
0:05
to go over what the assignment is about.
0:07
I'm going to give you my final answer.
0:08
I'm going to go over the math concepts
0:10
all while using the driver framework to
0:12
guide my analysis and my method. So
0:16
first what we're solving today the topic
0:18
is market efficiency investigation.
0:21
Here we are investigating market
0:23
efficiency using the GameStar short
0:25
squeeze event of 2020 2021 as a case to
0:29
study. We're going to verify the stated
0:31
facts, analyze price behavior related to
0:34
efficient market hypothesis predictions,
0:36
and evaluate whether market anomalies
0:38
can constitute evidence against market
0:40
efficiency or can be explained within
0:42
existing frameworks. So the first step
0:44
is to verify the statement of GameStop
0:47
traded at 0.04 $04 in August 2020. We
0:51
have an event timeline here which I
0:53
won't read out loud. We have key data
0:56
points. And then our required analysis
0:57
today is to verify all the stated
1:00
historical price data and document
1:02
corrections. Test which form market
1:04
efficiency, weak, semi- strong or strong
1:06
violated. evaluate whether rational
1:08
investors could have profited
1:10
systematically and compare the efficient
1:12
market hypothesis predictions to observe
1:15
behavior and assess behavioral finance
1:18
explanations for observe an anomalies.
1:21
The main financial concept today is the
1:24
capital asset pricing model otherwise
1:26
known as CAPM which we'll go into later
1:29
in my analysis. So the answer is the
1:32
GameStop event of 2021 represented a
1:36
profound though temporary violation of
1:39
the semi- strong form of the efficient
1:41
market hypothesis. The market was
1:44
inefficient because GME's price became
1:46
completely decoupled from all publicly
1:48
available fundamental information,
1:51
company performance, analyst valuations,
1:54
and e economic outlook. Instead, the
1:57
price was driven by a behavioral social
2:00
media campaign, technical market
2:02
mechanic, a short squeeze, which are
2:04
elements that the semi-strong EMH argue
2:07
should not be able to systematically
2:08
move prices away from their fair value
2:10
shortages greater than 140% of float.
2:13
The implication of this information,
2:15
which we'll get into in more detail
2:17
later in my analysis, is the breakout
2:19
breakdown in rational pricing. This
2:22
wasn't a small fluke. It was a clear
2:23
sign that the stock price had completely
2:25
disconnected from the company's real
2:27
value. It proves that investors who were
2:29
just following social media behavioral
2:31
momentum could make huge profits which
2:33
shouldn't happen if the market was
2:34
rational and efficient. Key takeaways
2:37
are behavioral finance is not a footnote
2:39
to EMH. It's a core driver. Hurting
2:42
sentiment and prospect theory can and do
2:44
create bubbles and market structure
2:46
itself can create an inefficiency. That
2:49
finding means that the hedge funds had
2:50
borrowed and sold 40% more
2:53
shares than they actually existed for
2:54
the public to trade. This created a p
2:57
powder keg because all these short
2:59
sellers were eventually forced to buy
3:00
back shares that weren't easily
3:02
available, creating a massive
3:03
unstoppable spike when retail investors
3:06
started buying.
3:09
Okay, continuing on,
3:12
we're going to start basing my analysis
3:14
on the driver framework. We already
3:17
let's go to that part. We already did
3:19
the define and discover. We defined the
3:21
objective test a semi-short form of EMH
3:23
using the GME January 2021 anomaly as a
3:26
case study. The hypothesis was if the
3:29
EMH was violated, we should be able to
3:30
quantify massive cumulative abnormal
3:33
returns C that is explained by market
3:36
risk data and the key assumptions that I
3:38
already mentioned again was all the data
3:40
we were provided but also daily adjusted
3:42
closing price. This is from Y finance
3:45
and then the market proxy. We have the
3:48
S&P 500 is a valid proxy. The model is a
3:52
simplified market model visual
3:53
visualized by comparing cumulative
3:55
returns is sufficient to illustrate the
3:56
abnormal return.
3:59
And then the event window is January to
4:01
February 2021. R and driver framework
4:04
represent our analytical plan. We
4:06
already I already kind of went through
4:07
this but to prove the semi-trong form
4:09
was violated, we must show that the
4:11
price moved independently of fundamental
4:13
value and that we will conduct a
4:15
simplified event study. The visual stat
4:18
strategy to make sure it was easy for
4:19
other people to understand was to plot
4:21
the GME's price against a market
4:23
benchmark, the S&P 500, and to show its
4:26
massive deviation.
4:29
Next, we had to plot GME's trading
4:31
volume to visualize the retail frenzy
4:33
and calculate and plot the cumulative
4:35
abnormal return to quantify the
4:36
inefficiency. The key formula is
4:39
abnormal return. The core of an event
4:41
study is the abnormal return, which is
4:42
the actual return minus the expected
4:44
return. Pretty self-explanatory. Here's
4:46
the formula list out and of course A R
4:49
is abnormal return. R is actual return
4:51
for GME on day T. And then the E of I
4:54
int is expected return of GME on day T.
4:58
And the expected return is typically
5:00
calculated using a model like CAPM the
5:02
main financial concept of today which is
5:04
the E of R of it equals R of FD plus
5:07
beta of R of MT minus R of FD. And for
5:11
the visual analysis we will use a
5:12
simplified market model which where E of
5:15
R of it which is approximately the beta
5:17
of R of MT by plotting JM's key limit of
5:21
return against the markets we
5:22
representing the C on collab. So before
5:27
I show you the the collab and the code
5:29
we're going to talk about I and driver
5:31
which is implement financial logic which
5:34
is we're going to use Python and pull
5:36
the data from Yahoo Finance. The step
5:38
one was data verification. We'll first
5:40
check the August 2020 price and correct
5:44
it if needed. Step two, pro price and
5:46
volume plotting. We will plot the GE
5:48
adjusted close price and it's trading
5:50
volume two separate subplots. The price
5:52
chart will show the what the and the
5:54
spike and the volume chart will show the
5:56
how. Step three was to add more more
5:59
turn visualization. We'll normalize the
6:00
starting price of GM and the S&P 500 to
6:02
one on January 1st, 2020. And by
6:04
plotting this cumulative growth, it'll
6:06
be a nice visual way to see the vast gap
6:08
between the two lines. And that proves
6:10
the price was not moving with the
6:12
market. So here we're going to go into
6:14
our our code at this point. Here's the
6:17
code. Let me go all the way to the top.
6:21
We have all our libraries imported. And
6:23
then we have the configuration and
6:26
assumptions. All this information was
6:28
given through the assignment. And then
6:31
we have the modular calculation blocks
6:34
blocks. Sorry. Here we are downloading
6:37
histo historical data
6:40
and it helps us get the calculations
6:42
ready.
6:44
And then here we are validating the
6:47
data. Very important. And then here
6:48
there's several warnings and okays that
6:52
the user can see to see if there's
6:53
missing data. The data is in the event
6:55
window if it's valid data. Very
6:57
important. And the v and dryer framework
6:59
is validate which I'll touch on a little
7:00
bit after I finish showing the code. And
7:02
then we have the professor's data check.
7:06
And then we have the plot price volume
7:09
which is where we are seeing the the
7:11
code for how to plot and then we have
7:13
the plot one code and the plot two code.
7:19
Continuing on now we have the important
7:22
calculations. We are calculating the C
7:25
and that calculation is right here. And
7:28
as you can see, it follows the same
7:29
formula I mentioned in my analysis.
7:33
And that's also plotted on the figure as
7:35
you can see. And then we have the main
7:37
exe execution
7:39
right here. So now the output it runs
7:42
all the validation guard rails. The data
7:44
is complete. No nas validation is K.
7:46
Event window data is present. Validation
7:48
complete. All this data is ready. And
7:51
now we have the decisive KPI
7:53
calculation. The peak GME cumulative
7:56
return is 55.07. CR7 the market S S&P
8:00
return at peak is 1.17
8:03
and that means the peak cumulative
8:04
abnormal return C the main financial
8:07
concept is about 5390%
8:11
which is a very abnormal
8:14
here we have the two graphs that I'm
8:17
going to go three graphs sorry that
8:19
we're going to go further into an
8:21
analyzing right now. So, we're going to
8:24
go back to the top of our analysis.
8:27
The first part, the peak GI cumulative
8:29
return of 55.07%.
8:32
This means $1 invested in G on January
8:35
1st grew to 55.07 at the very peak of
8:38
the spike in January 2021. And you can
8:40
see this in one of the graphs that I'll
8:41
mention in a second. The market one is
8:44
the exact same moment GME peaked at
8:46
55.07, 07 with the $1 invested in the
8:48
rational overall market, the S&P 500,
8:51
had only grown to $1.17.
8:54
Very little growth. Now, the peak
8:57
cumulative abnormal return of the
8:58
5,390%.
9:00
This is the unexplained part or the
9:02
proof of inefficiency. It's a massive
9:04
difference between the GME actually did
9:05
$55.07
9:07
and what the rational market expected it
9:09
to do, $1.17.
9:11
And that's where you see 55.07 07 minus
9:15
1.17 gets 53.90 and as a percentage
9:19
that's the abnormal return and now the
9:22
graph tells the same thing the price and
9:23
volume graph shows why this happening
9:25
you can see the gray GME volume bars
9:30
here
9:35
the GME volume right here let me move
9:38
the screen a bit
9:43
and Then
9:45
going back exploded in January 2021 and
9:48
that can be seen again right here.
9:53
And that's why the retail buying and
9:55
that was the retail buying frenzy. This
9:57
massive volume is what caused the red
9:59
GME price line to spike. Here's a visual
10:02
proof.
10:04
And the cumulative returns graph shows
10:05
the result of that frenzy. The red line
10:07
GM's growth completely detached from the
10:09
blue line, the rational market's growth.
10:10
And that's where the 5390%
10:13
car is the size of that graph proving
10:15
that price is driven by the volume
10:16
frenzy, not by rational market
10:18
fundamentals, which is the whole point
10:20
of this exercise. And that can be seen
10:22
right here. They're fully disconnected
10:25
right here. It's fully disconnected.
10:27
Very big gap between these two lines.
10:33
Okay, going back down to validate. I
10:35
showed you the validation framework in
10:37
our code and the output of that but just
10:40
logical validation. The charts will
10:42
confirm the narrative and it did. It
10:43
matched the numeric numerical answers.
10:46
It considered all and it considered
10:48
alternate explanations is the EMA
10:50
proponent would argue if it was so
10:51
mispriced why didn't rational
10:54
arbitrators
10:55
short it back to $40. And the reason I
10:58
think that's not valid is the event is a
10:59
perfect example of why inefficiency can
11:01
persist. fundamental risk the rational
11:04
short could have gone wrong implement
11:06
implementation costs the cost to borrow
11:09
GM shares to short becomes astronomical
11:12
and then noise trader risk again
11:15
now for E more sophisticated tests can
11:18
always be done rigorous event study
11:21
with GM's true alphas and betas this can
11:25
calculate more precise calculations the
11:27
sentiment analysis use NLP to scrape
11:31
we
11:32
correlate the volume of GE to other
11:35
things like nextj trading volume returns
11:37
just proving the social media impact and
11:41
now reflect conclusion is the GI event
11:44
is defining
11:46
moment for behavioral finance. It proves
11:48
that markets are not always rational.
11:50
Behavioral concepts like hedging and
11:53
prospect theory can create a collective
11:54
voting machine. Those are very key
11:56
concepts and terminology used in the
11:58
financial word world. And likely key
12:01
learning is market efficiency is not a
12:03
binary state. True or false, but a
12:04
spectrum. While markets are mostly
12:07
efficient, the GI saga shows that a
12:09
perfect storm behavioral factors, social
12:11
media technology, and flawed market
12:13
mechanics can create massive
12:16
inefficiencies.
12:19
So now before I go into my final answers
12:21
for the questions to consider, I wanted
12:23
to explain some of the parts of the math
12:25
and financial concepts deeper because
12:27
that is the ultimate reason we're doing
12:28
these assignments. And for the efficient
12:32
market hypothesis EMH the weak form
12:37
all past sorry all past trading data
12:40
prices and volumes already reflected in
12:42
the price you cannot profit from
12:44
technical analysis this the gen event
12:48
likely violates this as a momentum
12:49
self-sustaining the semi-rong form on
12:52
the other hand all publicly available
12:54
information as reflected in the price
12:56
you cannot profit from fundamental
12:58
analysis this is the form that was most
13:00
clearly violated and that's why we did
13:01
all of our analysis based on that strong
13:04
form. All information public and private
13:06
insiders reflected in this price. This
13:08
one was wildly considered to be false
13:10
though. Now, short squeeze. I know I use
13:12
that term, but I want to explain it
13:14
more. This is the mechanic that fueled
13:16
the bubble. Shorting a hedge fund
13:18
borrows one share of GME at 10 and sells
13:20
it hoping to buy back for five. Return
13:21
the share in pocket $5 difference. It's
13:24
a squeeze. That's when retail traders
13:26
like Wall Street coordinate to buy GME
13:28
driving the price up to $400.
13:31
Margin call. The short sellers broker
13:33
demands their closer position. They must
13:34
now buy back the share at $400 to return
13:36
it realizing a $390 loss. And that's the
13:40
feedback loop. Feedback loop force
13:43
buying to cover shorts pushes the prices
13:46
even higher which forces forces other
13:48
short sellers to buy creating a cascade.
13:50
This is what happened when short
13:51
interest exceeded 100% on the floor.
13:53
There literally were not enough SHs to
13:55
go around and that was the problem and
13:56
that was what caused the inefficiencies.
14:00
Now just a little comparison EMH and
14:02
behavioral human
14:05
behavioral assumes investors are humans
14:07
driven by psychology
14:09
with hurting confirmation bias and
14:11
sentiment those psychological concepts
14:13
coming in. EMH is more rational assumes
14:15
investors were rational objective econ
14:17
who value assets based on their future
14:19
cash flow.
14:21
Okay, answering just quickly the
14:24
specific questions we wanted to
14:25
consider. Was the market efficient
14:26
during this episode? No. The price
14:28
became fundamental
14:31
fundamentally unmed from any rational
14:33
valuation.
14:35
There's a clear representation of a
14:36
market bubble. What type of efficiency
14:38
was violated? Semi strong was definitely
14:42
violated. Public fundamentals was
14:44
completely ignored. Furthermore, the
14:45
public information that 140% of the
14:47
float was short. It was very um
14:49
information retal retail traders used to
14:52
trigger the squeeze. All those financial
14:54
concepts I just talked about. The weak
14:56
form was also probably violated.
14:59
Should a rational investor have
15:00
profited?
15:04
This one's a bit difficult. A rational
15:05
investor would have seen the stock $100
15:08
and concluded it was overvalued. Either
15:11
shorted it or stayed away. This investor
15:13
would have lost a fortune. But a
15:15
different type of investor who
15:17
understands the behavioral dynamics of
15:19
market mechanics could have profited.
15:21
The investor could have rationally
15:23
identified the short interest as an
15:25
unstoppable powder keg.
15:29
And what does this say about market
15:30
efficiency theory versus behavioral
15:32
finance? It proves that behavioral
15:33
finance is a critical lens for under
15:35
understanding markets. It shows that
15:37
efficiency is not a given. The market is
15:40
a complex system for humans. Behavior
15:42
and sometimes it's rational models
15:44
breaks down completely. suggests that
15:45
while markets may be efficient on
15:47
average, they're highly susceptible to
15:49
black swan events. And that's the
15:50
primary thing I took away from this

",FALSE,1,"Okay. So this is WVA8 on uh market
efficiency and uh behavior focused on
the efficient market hypothesis and uh
the abnormal return formula.
So let's go to the actual prompt. So,
basically, we'll want to investigate
market efficiency using the GameStop
short squeeze in uh 2020/2021
as a case study. Uh, and we're going to
want to verify the data the book gives
us. Um, and then there there's a general
timeline here. Uh, and then key data
points that we'll all have to verify.
So, basically in August 2020, GME wasn't
doing too well. Uh
I believe its stock was around a little
more than a dollar, which isn't very
good for such a big um retailer. And
then at some point
uh at least my knowledge before I went
into this and do research is that some
guy named Roaring Kitty made a YouTube
video where he shorts it. And eventually
that snowballed into a whole Reddit
thing where a lot of people shorted it
and basically uh some of them at least I
hope got a lot of money. Um and then
there was hearings about whether it was
considered market manipulation etc. Then
there's some data here that um
I think is maybe not exactly what we
want. So the short interest just means
that a lot of people were shorting the
money
and um
so the retail trading volume increased
10fold because uh you know everybody on
Reddit suddenly got into this nothing
stock and then um there were trading
restrictions and yeah other stuff like
that. really good idea is that the
fundamental value of the stocks were
like 10 to 40 maybe.
So before I even get into define and
discover, I want to talk about a crucial
first step is verify the information. So
generally through facteing I figured out
all the information is there is correct
except for this that says GameStop
traded at 4 cents in August 2020.
Untrue. So I believe the highest that
month was was 132 and the lowest was
105. So uh we definitely want to resolve
that data point because it's very
important.
Click this.
So um now basically because one piece of
data has been gone into question it
would be smart to look at everything and
verify the accuracy. Fortunately for us
everything does check out. Um and
there's the bonus in that we've sort of
started our verification process. Uh now
let's move to discover and define. So
what's our objective here? What do we
want to get done? Is we want to compare
the efficient market hypothesis against
the reality of GameStop. So there are
three forms. The weak, the strong and
the semi- strong. Weak says the market
captures all historical price data.
Semi-rong says it does that and it adds
all public data. And then the strong
form says it also includes um
insider data.
Um so what's our scope? We to be really
broad at the moment. we want to look
around August 2020 to perhaps even look
at towards February 2021 because that's
like the to the moon event where the the
stock price shot up um because everyone
was buying it and then um
we want to talk about the aftermath
talk about the bonus later with the with
our constraints. Uh let's think about
what we have to analyze here. So we have
the historical stock data and the method
we're going to use abnormal return
calculation and sort of use that to make
a conclusion about historical stock
data. Our success metric is going to be
a uh can we make a well ststructured
explanation of whether this violates or
follows the efficient market hypothesis
based on abnormal returns.
Sanity check. I expect large abnormal
returns because GME really wasn't worth
as much it was trading for. It was uh
trading for hundreds of dollars at some
point and we know that the uh the
fundamental value is around 10 to 40 per
share.
Next, let's talk about S uh this is our
standard. Let's talk about benchmark. I
think what we're going to see is a a
very very big abnormal return
within our specific period and then we
may also uh see a return to normal as
time progresses.
Now we can move to the represent stage.
So what are we going to look at? We're
going to use an estimation period. So
uh basically I guess I'll skip down
there to the formulas. But to figure out
the expected return we have, we need to
find alpha and beta values for the
stock. And uh the only way for us to do
that is to use data or given to us. I
prefer using data um because it's alpha
and beta right now might not be the same
as it's alpha and beta in 2020. So I
made a sort of estimation period from
888 to11.
That way we have some buffer between it
but we are very close and we're using a
lot of days. So our data will be
accurate but not manipulated by the
event itself. And then um I call January
13th 2021 day zero. And then um
we call January 4th to January 29th
uh sort of the peak days. Um because
what we want to analyze here is not
necessarily looking at oh every single
piece of data that's happened in this
period of like a year or two. We want to
look at these specific concentrated
clusters. And I think here we want to
look at the point where the price peaked
which is right during that time. Uh this
test is specifically going to be about
the semi- strong form. Um but I will I
will eventually get into what this says
about the weak and the the completely
strong form. And then our formulas
normal return is alpha plus beta times
the return of the market. That's pretty
standard. Um and then we'll find alpha
and beta by using the historical
returns. And then our abnormal return
will be hey what's the difference
between what we expected and what
actually happened? that'll tell us what
like arbitrage occurred.
Okay. So for the implement step
um on the bottom left first is where you
should look. Um that basically
calculates uh within that set of like 10
to 14 days what the return was that we
of the market what the return of the
actual stock what it was what we
expected to be and then the difference.
So you can see on 127 something crazy
happened like a huge increase and then
on day uh on the 28th of January it it
had a crazy drop. Um, in terms of our
conclusions from our implementation
step, I'm going to say the average daily
abnormal return is 21% which is very
very high and the cumulative amount was
almost 400.
Um,
and then um, sorry something is blocking
my view.
Okay. And then we need to talk about the
market efficiency. So uh the semir has
been violated because uh generating
those kinds of abnormal returns
shouldn't be possible in a extremely
efficient market. And the insights I'm
going to have is that the semi strong
predicts that all the public information
like the short interest information
um should be priced in like nearly
instantly or very fast. uh we found our
our analysis found like even like months
uh of uh time for arbitrage if you want
to call it that and then you know the
market failed to efficiently process
this information like quickly so that's
a pretty standard violation now I want
to go to my collab and just explaining
the generals of my code so we want to
import uh sort of use Wi-Fi panda pandas
inside so that we can use financial
data, put it in a data set and then
analyze it with stats.
So these are our tickers and then this
is our time frame that we're inputting
and then what we're doing is we're
downloading the data and then we're
finding the percent change. So that
allows us percent change is like the
definition of return from year to year
at least. Um and then it's just dropping
anything that uh doesn't exist. So any
data we have or don't have, we're just
ignoring it. In this case, we are not.
So that's fine.
Um and then now we need to make code for
the estimation stage.
So we set a start date and end date
and then we find the returns
from the start to the end.
And then basically we estimate uh the
spy return on average and then we
estimate the uh
returns of games and then we perform a
linear regression using stats is
probably one of the best ways to do it.
Um that's basically going to minimize
error in our results and then basically
it's going to find an alpha value and a
beta value. So that line has an
intercept and a slope. And so beta is
the slope that scales with how much the
market is doing. And then the alpha is
uh just the intercept there.
Great.
So we should expect a high beta.
Anyways, now we actually going to
implement uh the analysis.
So we set event start date and event end
date and then
see we copy it and then basically we're
calculating what the return should be
based on the market by doing alpha plus
beta times the data. It's a very simple.
It's just doing it parallelly. So it
looks a little complicated.
And then um basically it's just putting
all that information we just calculated
in the chart. And then
right here,
right here is printing it. So that's
great. And then now it's just saying
some stuff about uh the efficiency test
uh which is basically
uh the conclusion I just told you.
there's not much stuff that I haven't
already covered there. So, it's uh some
insight into my code.
Now, I want to talk about verifying. So,
let's talk about the significance of our
results and its real world impact. So,
is it like statistically significant? Is
this something that occurred just by
chance? Uh or do we at least have some
reason to think that it's not by chance?
And I would say yes because when the
cumulative percent is like 400 that is a
crazy amount. There are people that like
are getting like
I mean in my high yield savings account
I'm getting like 4% a year. 400 is
crazy. That's what you expect from an
extremely extremely risky investment
that like gets pretty close to throwing
money away or something incredibly
lucrative. So yeah, that's something is
definitely going on here that's not just
up to chance when it comes to economic
significance. Yes, because um one of
these stocks alone was worth hundreds of
dollars from from single dollars. So
that's if someone puts $100 in, they get
$10,000 out and a lot of people can
afford to put in 100 and their lives
would be changed by 10,000. So it is
significant in this very real world
sense of some some big changes are
happening here
and then um when it comes to does this
keep happening or is it a one-off uh
this sort of thing has been going on
cycllically with GME a couple times not
quite as strong as the initial time but
I believe it it's at least happened uh
two times at this point and then uh is
this just a result of investors taking
on more risk and happening to get lucky.
No, because
GME as a retailer, it's not like the
things you would expect 400% interest
from are like
I don't know like mobsters like mostly
illegal things or like if you're
investing in an incredibly lucrative
company like Open AI, you might expect
that like at the very beginning, but
even them, they're not going to keep
that up. So uh no there there's no
amount of risk that uh sort of justifies
this happening.
Now we move to the evolve step. So
basically I use my code from before with
alpha and beta values except instead of
using an estimation period I just
slightly change them in one way or
another.
Um
so the middle value is uh what I found.
uh beta equals 2 it's about what I found
beta equals 2.5 and a=.3%.
So, uh, the center of the graph is the
situation we are currently looking at.
And then I just varied them because I
wanted to see, hey, maybe it's a data
issue. Maybe our estimations are just
off and that's throwing us off. But you
can see I'm having huge variances. I'm
almost having and doubling B and then
alpha is going like negative and like
tripling. And even then, the abnormal
returns are still in the high 600%
cumulatively for every single one of
these situations. Meaning, you know,
even if our estimates like were way way
way off, like we wouldn't expect any of
this to happen. So, um
we'd be in a similar situation. So, uh
that's I guess an extended verification
of how good our estimation is. And we
know for sure it's good because every
situation generates uh this scenario.
Now let me make a conclusion about the
fishing market hypothesis. Uh so let's
start with semi- strong form. Um this
was violated because we didn't
uh I talked about short interest, right?
because so many people are shorting the
stock uh that they didn't account for
the both of the risk for them and the
return for other people of buying the
stock from them when they flood the
market. So um the semi- strong form
generated abnormal we generated abnormal
returns meaning we know the semi-rong
was not uh doing well then we can talk
about the strong form uh this is sort of
just logically violated because stronger
is more strict than semi- strong. So uh
if the semi-rong is violated the strong
also must by definition be violated. Um
just sort of logically there. Uh I'm
unsure about any insider info. Obviously
I don't have any good insight into that.
Uh I tried to look but I I couldn't find
anything. Um so yeah and then uh the
weak form we can sort of logically say
this was violated because
the historical price data didn't reflect
what was happening. The week says the
price at least considers
the historical data but it wasn't it was
violated. it considered it was uh it was
mispriced
in the sense I guess if you look at it
one way uh it was overpriced because
everyone was buying into it and it was
violated by momentum right everybody
says everybody needs to buy it suddenly
we all buy it suddenly we all want it
and suddenly the price goes up that's
what happened right and the converse
would be sell when going down but that
hasn't quite happened as much um and
then from another perspective you know
the true value of this is $10 to $40
guys uh based on our our past details.
Um and like it was trading for like a
dollar. So maybe it was a little
undervalued. Uh like I say little but it
was like 10% of its actual value but
like relatively
slightly undervalued but really it was
like massively undervalued if you think
like 400 is like the real value. But uh
I think the first one is more accurate
where the weak form has been violated by
momentum and sort of this craze of
investors and uh psychology like the
human element.
Now I can move to the reflect stage
because I've uh I've pretty much covered
the prompt. So
what I've learned is that
we're kind of iffy on the efficient
market hypothesis. It is just a
hypothesis and it isn't always true and
it doesn't always work. um people being
irrational on Reddit about buying into
things because it's going to it's going
to moon, it's going to make me rich,
etc. And then things like structural
flaws like some people not realizing
that uh that short interest was so high
makes us have very very inefficient
market outcomes. So
uh that's a very interesting thing where
the human element can sort of take us
out of what we calculate and what we
expect. Another thing is I realized that
public info is not just financial,
right? That info that people look at
isn't just hey the returns this that
like analytical stuff like we might be
looking at. It's also hey like oh who
bought not even who bought shares. It
could be like oh what did someone say
about this or on Reddit how are people
talking about this? Which is something
that's very hard to regulate and
control. It's very interesting. Uh a lot
of my conclusion is that we should
respect the markets pricing but we
should also doubt it um because there
are opportunities for arbitrage
everywhere for us to make a profit.
And then finally um
we need to be active in the market uh at
least in the way we interact with it not
passive. So passive is just accepting
the prices that come your way. What we
need to do is aggressively uh be looking
at hey this is how it's valued but you
know it isn't always valued right. So uh
we want to bring in some sort of house
view. you know, as a VC, as an investor,
even as an individual, you want to be
looking actively at how uh stock prices
both change based on financial data and
like social data.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"00:00 Hello, my name is Ryan Swan, and today I will be presenting my Session 8 assignment using the Driver Analytical Framework.
00:13 I will begin with the Define and Discover stage. The primary objective of my analysis is to investigate market efficiency using the 2020-2021 GameStop GME Short Squeeze as an empirical case study.
00:30 My goals are to verify all new, Numerical claims, especially the statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020, evaluate how GameStop's price behavior aligned or conflicted with weak-form, semi-strong, and strong-form efficiency.
00:48 Determine whether rational investors could have earned systematic or risk-adjusted abnormal returns. And assess behavioral finance explanations, including hurting, overconfidence, and fear of missing out, and limits to arbitrage.
01:09 To begin the discover stage, I gather data from Yahoo Finance, SEC filings, and historical reporting about the event. I also outline the key event timeline.
01:20 August 2020, GME trades between roughly $1 and $5, near long-term lows. September 22nd, 2020, Ryan Cohen discloses a 12.9% stake via Skype.
01:36 January 2021, massive Reddit-driven price surge, $483 on January 28th, February 18th, 2021 Congressional hearings on the market event.
01:57 My success metrics include verified factual accuracy, especially price history, clear classification of which EMH forms were violated, and success. Statistically meaningful abnormal return analysis, integration of behavioral finance insights as well.
02:19 Getting into my represent stage, I will represent my analysis plan behaviorally. Before implementing any code, uh, data acquisition plan.
02:29 I will download the following data from Yahoo finance, the daily OHLC prices for GME between August, 2020 and February, 2021, the daily trading value.
02:40 benchmark returns for the S&P 500, volatility measures, short interest data from FINRA and market reports, event study design.
02:56 I will, define event windows around major public announcements, Cohen 13-D filing which took place on September 22nd, 2020, rocketing of retail volume in January 2021, trading restrictions on the on January 28th, 2021, and congressional hearing February 18th, 2021.
03:19 For each event, I will calculate expected returns using the market model, abnormal returns, the AR, and cumulative abnormal returns. E&H testing framework, weak form, auto-correlation of daily returns, volatility patterns, and momentum patterns.
03:44 Reversals, semi-strong form, speed of price adjustment after public announcements, and then for strong form, evaluate whether insiders of privileged agents earned persistent returns.
04:00 And then for behavioral finance, I will examine hurting and social contagion, overconfidence, and narrative bias, limits to arbitrage faced by the hedge funds, and short squeeze mechanics due to, due to greater than 100% short interest peaking near 140%.
04:26 Moving into my implement stage. Now I will move, uh, into implementation using Python code, uh, that I will create with the help of AI.
04:42 Uh, so to start we're going to verify the 4 cents in August 2020 claim. And using Yahoo Finance data from August 1st, the lowest closing price was $1.04 and the intraday low was $1 on August 3rd.
05:01 This was found using this code. It pulls in information from Yahoo Finance and looks for, uh, game stops, uh, close, high, low, open, and volume for the dates of August 3rd through August 4th.
05:20 As the code shows, the low on August 3rd was $1, not $0.04, which disproves the original statement that it was $0.04.
05:36 Therefore, the GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 is factually incorrect by two orders of magnitude.
05:52 Weak form EMH test. I calculated daily returns from 2020 and 2023, and examined the autocorrelation function, uh, and using this configuration.
06:08 I was able to use numbers from Yahoo Finance, and the code created a graph, multiple graphs that I could use to evaluate if the weak form, uh, occurs.
06:24 efficiency was valued, was, uh, valid, violated. So, looking at our autocorrelation of GME graph, which can be shown here, the first several lags exceeded the 95% confidence bounds, and this indicates several dis-dependence, uh, violating weak form efficiency, uh, GameStop's extreme momentum, and, and
06:56 mean reversion patterns are inconsistent with a random walk, uh, what this means is that the weak form EMH was violated.
07:07 For the semi-strong EMH test, using event windows, I calculated abnormal, normal return surrounding major announcements. So, showing my code, here is the code that I created with the help of AI, if you need to you can pause and look through it, uh, however I cannot read through it.
07:28 So, I each line of it in time, so pause and read through. So, it created me this graph, which shows the price during the time we are evaluating and how it, moved with information.
07:48 What this shows us is that during Cohen's 13-D filing led to a delay multi-week drift rather than immediate adjustment. In January 2021, prices exploded.
08:00 Far beyond even the most optimistic fundamental values estimates of $10-40, and public information did not incorporate instantly. Instead, speculative dynamics dominated.
08:15 What this means is that the Semi-Strong EMH test was violated. Moving into the Strong Form EMH test. Strong Form requires that no insider or privileged party can consistently earn abnormal returns.
08:32 In the GameStop case, there is no evidence of insiders systematically profiting, or, systematically profited. Hedge funds with, uhh, sophisticated- data, like, short interest ana-analytics and order flow signals actually suffered massive losses.
08:56 An example is Melvin Capital with a minus 53 percent, and retail order flow routing through holes- er, sellers, did not convey unfair insider profitability.
09:11 Thus, strong form EMH was not violated. Moving into our validate stage, to validate the robustness of my results, I re-routed multiple date windows to ensure consistent AR and carve values.
09:27 I verified price, history, agent, multiple sources to estimate data sourcing artifacts. Auto-correlation results were stable across sampling frequencies.
09:40 Carve remained significantly positive and abnormal across all event windows confirming reproducibility and Thanks. Bye. This can be shown in this code that we created.
09:56 Uh, my results are therefore statistically and conceptually validated. Uh, moving into our Evolve 2.0.
10:08 Evolve analysis beyond the base assignment extended the event study by estimating GameStop's beta relative to the S&P 500. GameStop displayed a low, unstable, and sometimes negative beta, meaning market risk could not explain itself.
10:24 GameStop calculated expected returns and compared them to realized returns. Cars spiked massively during January 2021, confirming that price movements were discoupled from fundamentalism.
10:40 This evolution step shows that even sophisticated risk adjustment models failed to explain GameStop's behavior, supporting behavioral explanations.
10:56 GameStop clearly violated weak form, and semi-strong EMH.
11:12 Information incorporation, uhm, and speculatation blow-off. Uh, the strong form EMH held as insiders did not consistently earn abnormal returns.
11:26 Uh, behavioral health. Uh, emotional hurting, social signaling, fear of missing out, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage explain most of the anomaly, and no rational investor could have achieved systemic excess returns.
11:43 X and Z. Uh, enormous profits were large, luck, and timing, not skill. Using the driver framework forced me to structure my research, verify data early, and avoid premature conclusions.
11:59 This case study of offered powerful insights into how real-world markets can diverge sharply from theoretical efficiency, especially when behavioral forces overwhelm fundamentals.

",FALSE,1,"My name is Cody TEK and today I will be
0:04
presenting my investigation into market
0:06
efficiency using the 2020 GameStop short
0:09
squeeze as a case study. This assignment
0:12
required us to analyze this event
0:14
through the lens of the efficient market
0:16
hypothesis. Evaluate behavioral expect
0:18
explanations and as a critical first
0:20
step verify a specific historical fact.
0:24
Um to start with the define and discover
0:27
phase. So following the driver
0:29
framework, I started with the define and
0:30
discover stage. Obviously uh the
0:32
assignment's goal is to investigate
0:33
market efficiency using uh the GME
0:36
event. A critical first step was to
0:38
verify a specific claim that we were
0:40
given that GameStop traded at 4 cents in
0:43
August of 2020. My analytical scope was
0:45
defined as the period from August 1st,
0:48
2020 to March 31st, 2021, which allows
0:52
us to capture the leadup, the squeeze
0:53
itself, and then the immediate
0:55
aftermath. The data source I identified
0:57
was Yahoo Finance uh accessed via the Y
1:01
finance library in Python. Uh the
1:03
required data points were the standard
1:05
date, open, high, low, close, and
1:08
volume. I also noted potential
1:10
limitations such as the accuracy of the
1:12
free data versus professional terminals
1:15
and the need to use adjusted close
1:17
prices for accurate historical
1:19
comparisons, which Yahoo Finance
1:20
thankfully handles.
1:23
Next is the represent phase. Um, this is
1:26
where I actually like planned the data
1:28
acquisition. This was a very
1:30
straightforward plan. First, I'd import
1:32
the uh Y finance in the pandas library.
1:36
Then define the ticker GME and then the
1:39
uh start and end dates. Finally, I'd
1:41
then use the YF download function to
1:44
fetch the data. And then, as you can see
1:46
from the slide and my notebook, I then
1:48
called uh head and info on the new data
1:51
frame. This was to ensure the data
1:53
loaded correctly and all the columns
1:54
were proper data type for analysis.
1:58
Then we get to our implement stage. This
2:00
is where I executed that critical first
2:02
step uh verifying the statement that
2:04
GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of
2:07
2020. Before analyzing the why of the
2:09
squeeze, I had to make certain of the
2:12
what. My process in the notebook was
2:14
simple. Uh first, I filtered the main
2:16
data frame to isolate the August 2020
2:19
price. Second, I used the min function
2:22
on the low price column and the idx min
2:24
function to find the exact date this
2:26
minimum actually occurred. Finally, I
2:28
compared this actual minimum price to
2:30
the stated 4 cents. The results were
2:32
conclusive as the output shows the
2:34
minimum low price for uh GameStop in
2:36
August 2020 was a dollar, not 4 cents.
2:39
This low occurred on August 3rd, 2020.
2:42
Therefore, the premise that GME was
2:45
trading for pennies is inaccurate. While
2:47
a dollar is still pretty low, it
2:49
reflects its near bankruptcy status. Uh
2:52
it's a significant uh factual difference
2:54
from the 4 cents. This verification was
2:56
crucial before proceeding with the rest
2:58
of the analysis. Moving on to the
3:01
validate stage, I analyzed the data to
3:03
understand the squeeze behavior and
3:04
compare it to the predictions of the
3:06
efficient market hypothesis.
3:08
I calculated and plotted several
3:10
different uh technical indicators. So
3:13
this first chart is the most telling. It
3:15
shows the GMA closed price in blue
3:18
against its 50-day and 200 day moving
3:20
averages.
3:22
You can see the price was flat around $1
3:24
to4 from August to December of 2020.
3:27
Then in late January 2021, an explosive
3:29
surge to over $80 on this chart and then
3:32
an actual peak of $483.
3:36
The second chart uh here shows the
3:38
trading volume. The volume spikes are
3:40
astronomical uh corresponding perfectly
3:43
with the price surge in late January
3:44
confirming that this was a frenzy of
3:46
activity.
3:50
Then there's the code with it. My
3:51
notebook also includes the RSI chart.
3:54
The relative strength index um peaked
3:57
well above 90 signaling wildly
3:59
overbought conditions far beyond what
4:01
traditional analysis would deem
4:03
rational.
4:05
So then let's test this against like the
4:08
forms of market efficiency. Was the weak
4:10
form violated? This form says you can't
4:12
predict future prices from uh past data.
4:16
The GME event driven by momentum seems
4:18
to violate this, but it's arguable as
4:20
the squeeze itself was based on public
4:22
data. Um namely the high short interest.
4:26
Uh was the semi- strong form violated? I
4:29
believe so. Yes. Uh this form says all
4:31
public information is already reflected
4:33
in the price. Uh here the short interest
4:36
data was public for months but the price
4:39
didn't move until a coordinated social
4:40
media fed acted effort effort acted on
4:43
it. The price was clearly not reflecting
4:45
fundamentals which analysts estimated
4:47
around $10 to $40. Was the strong form
4:50
violated? Yes. This form says even
4:53
private info is priced in the
4:55
coordinated non-fundamental buying
4:57
clearly drove the price which is
4:59
inconsistent with this form. The price
5:01
behavior was completely
5:03
was completely an anomaly uh that
5:06
rational investors could not have
5:07
systematically profited uh without
5:09
taking on massive um unquantifiable
5:13
risk. Then we get to our evolve phase
5:16
where we evaluate why this happened. If
5:19
EMH can't fully explain it, what can?
5:21
This is where behavioral finance and
5:23
then market micro structure actually
5:24
come in. So, first behavioral proc
5:27
finance provides several key
5:29
explanations. Um, hurting behavior. This
5:33
was the primary driver. Millions of
5:35
retail investors coordinated on Wall
5:37
Street bets uh popular Reddit and then
5:39
acted as a single massive entity. Um,
5:42
narrative driven trading. This wasn't
5:45
just about money. It was about the
5:46
story. The David versus Goliath um
5:50
narrative was incredibly powerful. This
5:52
narrative com narrative combined with
5:54
FOMO uh led to buying pressure that was
5:57
completely divorced from fundamental
5:58
value. We also saw confirmation bias as
6:01
investors sought info that confirmed
6:03
their belief in the squeeze and the
6:05
availability bias from the intense media
6:07
coverage. Second, market micro structure
6:11
is key. The event was possible because
6:13
short interest had peaked at 140% of the
6:16
float. This created what's known as
6:18
limits to arbitrage situation. It was
6:21
structural vulnerability.
6:23
The retail herd exploited this, igniting
6:25
a short squeeze. As the price rose,
6:27
hedge funds like Melvin Capital were
6:29
forced to buy shares at any price to
6:31
cover their short positions, which only
6:33
pushed the price higher in a feedback
6:35
loop. This wasn't about fundamentals. It
6:38
was about the mechanical supply and
6:39
demand.
6:41
So the implication is that while markets
6:43
may be mostly efficient, they are not
6:45
perfectly efficient. The GameStop event
6:47
shows that a combination of behavioral
6:49
biases and market structure
6:50
vulnerabilities can create massive
6:52
short-term anomalies.
6:55
Finally, we get to our reflection phase.
6:57
This brings us back to the beginning. So
7:00
first, the the summary of findings. Uh
7:03
the professor's statement that GameStop
7:05
traded at 4 cents in August of 2020 is
7:08
inaccurate. The actual low was a dollar
7:11
on August 3rd, 2020. Uh, this analysis
7:14
of GameStop squeeze demonstrates a
7:15
significant though likely temporary
7:17
deviation from market efficiency, best
7:19
explained by a combination of behavioral
7:21
finance and market microructure issues.
7:24
Second, the stage requires determining
7:26
the appropriate communication approach
7:28
for correcting the professor.
7:31
The objective is to be respectful while
7:33
demonstrating through analysis. So our
7:35
approach would be first to acknowledge
7:37
the professor's statement as the
7:38
starting point for the verification.
7:41
Um then state my finding in verifying
7:44
the historical data. I analyzeed the low
7:46
prices for GameStop in August of 2020
7:48
from Yahoo Finance. I found that the
7:50
minimum was a dollar on August 3rd 2020
7:52
rather than the 4 cents mo uh mentioned
7:55
in the original prompt. The key is to
7:57
frame this as not like a you are wrong
7:59
but as an important finding to ensure
8:01
the rest of the market efficiency
8:03
analysis was built on correct and
8:04
precise foundation.
8:08
This entire exercise um from define and
8:11
discover to reflect demonstrates the
8:13
value of the driver framework starting
8:15
with a clear question verifying
8:17
assumptions implementing an anal an
8:19
analysis and then reflecting on a
8:21
broader on the broader implications of
8:23
the findings. Thank you.",,0,1

Hi guys, my name is Law and for today's
0:03
um video we are on session eight market
0:07
efficiency in behavioral finance.
0:11
So our assignment is to investigate
0:13
market efficiency using the GameStop GME
0:17
ticker short squeeze event of 2020 to
0:22
2021 as a case study. Verify the
0:25
accuracy of stated facts. analyze price
0:28
behavior relative to efficient market
0:30
hypothesis predictions and evaluate
0:33
whether market an anomalies consuted
0:37
evidence against market efficiency or
0:39
can be explained within existing
0:41
frameworks. So our first critical step
0:44
is verify the statement GameStop traded
0:46
at
0:48
0.04
0:50
cents in August 2022 against actual
0:53
historical data. If incorrect, document
0:56
the accurate figures and determine

Historic price data and documents are

2:12
semi strong, was validated.
2:14
Evaluate whether rational investor
2:16
should have probably profited
2:19
systematically. Compare efficient market
2:22
hypothesis prediction to observe
2:23
behavior access behavior as finance
2:26
components. Okay.
2:28
Um Okay. So our assignment is to analyze
2:31
the 2021 GameStop short squeeze um
2:34
framed as a test of the efficient market
2:38
hypothesis.
2:40
I will be following the driver framework
2:42
for this um analysis. So our first step
2:45
is to verify whether GameStop traded at
2:48
0 or 4 cents
2:52
in 0.04
2:55
cents
2:57
in August 20. So
3:01
I went ahead and
3:05
asked
3:08
Google Collab to verify that data using
3:12
browsing from what's it called? Yahoo
3:14
Finance and it came back saying that
3:17
that is incorrect.
3:20
Um, the lowest price in August was
3:22
actually a dollar
3:25
and with the assignment
3:28
saying it traded at the lowest was
3:32
04.04
3:35
which is that would make it incorrect
3:40
and okay
3:42
so here are my notes that I will be
3:46
going through. So the first stage is to
3:49
discover um critical requirements is to
3:53
verify that data which we just did um
3:57
because the prompt claims that it was
4:00
GameStop traded at 4 cents in August
4:02
2020.
4:04
Um before I can test any
4:08
theories,
4:12
I would have to um implement the stage
4:15
and pull the data directly, which is
4:20
what we did for the discover.
4:24
And
4:27
so so that would basically kind of do
4:30
the implement task before the R but
4:34
we'll also do the implement as well. So
4:37
to represent my analysis um so basically
4:42
after doing that that brings me back to
4:45
the represent stage which is this is
4:47
where my um analytic plan is. First I'll
4:51
visualize um the full event using the
4:54
data and second I will validate um the
5:00
data against three forms of um efficient
5:04
market uh hypothesis and then thirdly I
5:08
will um evolve the analysis by using
5:12
behavioral finance to explain the what
5:16
EMH
5:17
can't and then basically Ally finally
5:20
I'll reflect on that. So that is a
5:24
basically walk through what we will be
5:26
doing.
5:29
Okay to the implementing stage here.
5:33
So the chart that I showed here or I
5:36
didn't really show it but the chart here
5:38
is um shows the entire event from 2020
5:43
August of 2020 to 2021.
5:47
and then
5:49
of the basically how much the like how
5:54
much the stock was getting traded at and
5:57
such and such etc.
6:00
Um so basically the green bar here to
6:03
show you you guys the green bar here
6:05
represents the $10 to $40 range that um
6:10
analysts believe that the company was
6:12
actually worth. And in January 2021,
6:17
the price completely uh detached from
6:20
the reality exploring to 483
6:25
in event driven by um
6:29
social media fuel buying frenzy which I
6:32
believe is like when people pump
6:36
stocks.
6:39
All right. So that is it for the stock.
6:45
Okay. And then for the to validate this,
6:49
you guys can also here read my notes,
6:51
but I'll just kind of summarize the
6:53
notes and go over it. Um to validate the
6:57
the efficient market hypothesis against
7:00
um this event.
7:02
Um first the weak form.
7:08
Let me see.
7:14
There you go. The switch valid. Okay.
7:17
All right.
7:20
So, first the weak form was violated. Um
7:22
the theory says you can't use past data
7:25
to win, but Wall Street's bets community
7:29
did exactly that. Um they looked at
7:32
public historical number.
7:36
the 140% short interest and
7:41
correctly predicted a massive uh future
7:44
price surge too.
7:47
Um and then second the the semi- strong
7:51
form was spectacularly um validated as
7:54
well.
7:56
The three the three says um all public
8:00
information is already in the price but
8:03
the 140
8:06
the with the 140%
8:09
uh short interest was public
8:12
for months and the price stayed low. the
8:15
market failed to um incorporate this
8:17
information allowing the an um just the
8:23
anomaly to exist and the strong form
8:26
which deals with private info is not
8:29
really relevant here as this was a
8:32
public
8:33
um phenomenon.
8:36
All right, last word validate.
8:40
Here you go. These are basically short
8:43
version. I'm just summarizing it going
8:45
over the the notes here.
8:49
Um so with our evolve is if not EMH then
8:54
what? Um so this would explains
8:58
uh to evolve this analysis if the market
9:01
wasn't efficient what was it?
9:05
This is where behavioral um finance
9:07
takes over. So like we saw a classic
9:11
hurting as millions of investors on
9:14
social media act as one. We saw a
9:17
powerful
9:18
narrative apes versus suits that fueled
9:21
the overconfidence
9:25
game. But the most important concept is
9:28
um limits to average adage. The EM
9:34
uh relies on
9:37
rational investors to quote unquote fix
9:42
mispricing.
9:44
But in this case, it was too risky. Um
9:47
like Melvin Capital tried to be a
9:50
rational investor and they were bankrupt
9:53
for it. The risk of shorting a stock
9:56
with this much momentum
9:59
was infinite. The market can stay
10:03
irrational longer than
10:06
you can stay solvent and this allows the
10:10
bubble to grow for to evolve.
10:16
And then for the EMH model. So like I
10:21
said, these are my notes that you guys
10:22
could just look at and summarizing them
10:26
for the reflection. Um the GameStop
10:29
events um proves that efficient market
10:32
hypothesis is a useful model not an
10:36
unbreakable law. It shows that the
10:39
market is not a cold rational machine.
10:42
It is complex adaptive system driven by
10:47
human psychology.
10:50
So like could a rational investor have
10:52
profited? Looking back it seems easy but
10:56
at the time it was a pure gamble
10:59
and like what this
11:02
takeaway is that markets are are often
11:07
efficient. They're not always efficient.
11:09
And when human behavior, social media,
11:13
and flawed market structure like the 140
11:16
short interest collide, the market can
11:19
become spectacularly
11:22
I guess irrational.
11:26
And I think that is from my reflect.
11:29
Yes, that is it
11:33
for this assignment I believe. So yeah,
11:37
here's my code and stuff to implement
11:39
and validate as well.
11:42
If you guys
11:45
here the code
11:48
and then as if you guys want to double
11:51
check or to see you could also look at
11:55
the
11:57
the stock itself
12:01
of GameStop
12:03
for the time 2020 and 2021.
12:07
Here you can see
12:10
all the prices that it was um
12:16
basically
12:22
trading at as you guys can see
12:26
low of one for example low
12:29
into 2021. So,
12:34
so here before 2021
12:36
like GameStop was trading around one is
12:38
$1 to $6 range to um
12:44
for that assignment.
12:49
And that is it. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, my name is Isaac and this is my video presentation for session 8, market efficiency and behavioral finance. My analysis will focus on the GameStop short squeeze event, which I've investigated using the driver framework to test the very foundations of market efficiency.

On my agenda today, I'll first introduce the scenario, the 2021 GameStop event, where a retail stock defied all traditional financial models. My objective is to analyze this anomaly by testing the efficient market hypothesis or EMH against observable market data. And to do this, I will be following the six-step driver framework, moving sequentially from discover and represent through implementation and validation and concluding with the evolve and reflect.

Starting with the discover stage, the core of this assignment is a conflict between two major financial theories. On one side, we have the efficient market hypothesis, which states that all available information is already reflected in the stock's price. In this view, GME's price should have been near its fundamental value, which analysts place between 10 and $40. On the other side, we have behav behavioral finance which argues that human psychology biases like hurting and overconfidence can create massive irrational bubbles. My financial objective is to systematically analyze the GMA event to determine first if market efficiency was violated and if so, which form. Second, what behavioral biases can explain the price action? And third, why why limits to arbitrage prevented rational investors from correcting this clear mispricing.

The assignment includes a critical first step which is to verify a specific data point from the prompt. The cla the claim was that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. My first analytical action was to verify this against historical data from Yahoo Finance. My finding is that this claim is incorrect. The actual split adjusted low for GameStop in 2020 was approximately $4 per share. The 4 cents claim was likely an error based on pre-split data as GameStop conducted a 41 split in 2022. This diligence is critical as my entire analysis must be based on correct verified historical data which is what I'll be using from this point forward.

Now in the represent stage I will outline my analytical plan. First I need to acquire the historical price and volume data for both GameStop GME and the market benchmark. I've chosen the S&P 500 ticker SPY to represent the market's expected return. Second, I will plot this data to visually identify the anomaly and confirm that claims confirm the claims from the prompt. Third, and most importantly, I will conduct a market efficiency test based on calculating the abnormal return or AR. This will allow me to quantify the inefficiency. And finally, I will use these outputs to test the three forms of the me and identify the behavioral factors at play.

My analysis is built on two foundational concepts from our textbook. First are the three forms of efficiency market hypothesis. Weak form states that past price and volume data have no predictive power. Semi-rong form states that price reflects all publicly available information and strong form states that prices reflect all public and private information. To test this, I am using the abnormal return AR formula which is AR= R minus ER. My input my inputs are simple and powerful. The actual return R is the daily percentage of sorry the daily percentage change of GME and the expected return ER is the daily percentage change from the S&P 500 SPY. In an efficient market the abnormal rate sorry the abnormal return should average to zero. In an inefficient bubble we would expect to see large sustained positive abnormal returns. This is the hypothesis that I will test in my implementation.

I'm now in the implement stage which I used Google Collab and Python coding. My first block of code is for data acquisition. The financial logic is to pull all the raw data I planned for in the represent stage. The code itself is pretty straightforward. I import the Y finance pandas and mattplot lib libraries. I define my tickers GMA and spy and my data range. Then I use the yf.d download function. It's imp it's important to note as I discovered during my analysis that Y finance now defaults to auto adjust equals true. This means the close column it provides is already the correct split and dividend adjusted price. Therefore, I'm selecting the close column for my prices and the volume column for volume. After running the code, you can see the output on the right hand side. The data has was sorry has loaded correctly. The prices head output shows the split adjusted GME price from August 2020 starting around $13 which confirms my finding from the discover stage.

Next, I will visualize the anomaly. The financial logic here is to create a visual confirmation of the event before I quantify it. My code uses the map plot lib to create a figure with two subplots. The plot X1 will show GME's adjusted closing price and the bottom plot AX2 will show its trading volume. I've also I've also highlighted the key squeeze period in red for clarity. After running the code again, you can see the output on the right. The plots will be analyzed in the validate stage. Um, you can also see that the code has printed a key statistic, the verified peak price from that period, which my code calculated to be $86.88.

This final implementation step is the most critical. I'm now executing the test that I designed in the represent stage. The final logic logic is to calculate the plot sorry calculate and plot the abnormal return a r= r minus r

um and that's r gma minus the rspy.

My code does this in three steps. First I use the pct_ch change function to calculate the daily returns for both GMA and spy. Second, I create a a new abnormal return column by simply subtracting the spy return from the GME return. And finally, I plot these abnormal returns and also print key statistics for that squeeze period.

After the code is executed, you can see in the outputs on the right, it has calculated the returns in the AR and it has printed the statistics which are frankly outst astounding astounding.

I will now move to the validate stage to analyze these outputs in detail.

We are now in the validate stage. This is the first chart on my Python code generated. The analysis is crystal clear here. On the top plot, you can see that the price of GME was flat, trading for just a few dollars through all of 2022. Then in January 2021, the squeeze window, the price explodes in a par parabolic curve, reaching the $86.88 split adjusted peak that my code verified. You can see here on the bottom plot, the volume perfectly mirrors this, confirming the assignment's claim of a t-fold increase. Volume goes from negligible to massive spikes, confirming this was a high participation trading driven event.

The second chart is like the smoking gun of my entire analysis. This is the abnormal return plot generated by my code.

First look at the black dashed line at zero. As you can see here, this line represents the efficient market hypothesis prediction. In an efficient market, the purple line should just be random noise around this black line. Now look at the purple line. This is the observed reality that my code calculated for most of the 5-year period. It does look like noise. But inside the red squeeze box which you can see here

reality and theory completely diverge. The purple line explodes upwards. This is a massive stained positive abnormal return and it is definitive proof of market inefficiency. More importantly my code quantified this. The mean AR during the squeeze was 9.9%. This means on average day during that period, GME beat the market by nearly 10%. The max AR was 137.3%. My analysis found that on its peak day, GameStop's return was 137% higher than the return predicted by the market. This is the quantitative undeniable evidence that the market was not rational.

So to answer the question, which form of market efficiency was violated? My analysis based on the codes output concludes that all three forms here were actually violated. First of all, we have weak form which was violated. The weak form says that past price and volume can't predict future returns. My AR chart shows the exact opposite. a clear momentum pattern where past positive returns did predict future positive returns. Next up, we have the semi- strong form which was also violated. This is the clearest violation. The market completely ignored all rational public information like analyst reports valuing the stock at $10 to $40 and instead priced the stock based on a social media sentiment.

Third and last we have the strong form which was violated. This form says that even private information is reflected in the price. Here the coordinated sentiment and buying plans on the R wall street bets forum acted as a collective private information set. This group had an information advantage and profited from it before the broader market could react. This is a classic strong form violation.

In the evolve stage, we ask why and look at the broader implications of the analysis. First, could a rational investor have profited? The answer here is no. This event is a classic example of limits to arbitrage. A rational investor would have shorted this stock at $50, $100, or $200. But as the hedge fund Melvin Capital learned, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. They were forced to capsulate and buy back at massive losses. This entire event is only explainable through behavioral finance. My analysis identified hurting. This was a textbook case of a retail investors following the crowd on our Wall Street bets. Next, we have overconfidence. This group genuinely believed they could overestimate their abilities and forced a squeeze. And last, we have loss aversion. This is what forced the short the short sellers to capulate. The acute pain of their mounting losses forced them to buy back at any price, which is what completed the squeeze.

Finally, in the reflect stage, I will conclude with my key learnings and a summary of my process.

This assignment required me to follow the driver framework sequentially, and this process was critically was critical to my findings. My discover stage began with data verification where I corrected a factual error in the prompt establishing a solid foundation. My represent my represent stage laid out the financial logic building my analysis around the abnormal return formula for from our textbook. My implement stage which I used Google Collab and Python was where I executed this plan. My code successfully downloaded the data, navigated a change in the Y fin Finance library, and then calculated the exact quantitative proof that I needed. My validate stage used these code inputs, the charts, and the statistics to prove the abnormal return reached 137%. And that all three forms of the EMH were indeed violated. and my evolve stage connected this data to why identifying the behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage that made this anomaly possible. My final takeaway is that while markets are mostly efficient, there are complex systems run by humans. And as this case study proves, behavioral finance is a critical tool for understanding real world events where human psychology can and does overpower rational fundamental analysis.

",FALSE,1,"For this session assignment, uh we are
to investigate market efficiency using
the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020
to 2021 as a case study. Verify the
accuracy of stated facts, analyze price
behavior relative to efficient market
hypothesis predictions, and evaluate
whether market anomalies constitute
evidence against market efficiency or
can be explained within exist existing
frameworks. So before we get into the
critical first step, let's look at the
event timeline. August 2020, GM near
bankruptcy levels. September 2020, uh
Ryan Cohen acquires 13% stake. January
2021, Reddit r/wall street bets driven
price surge to $483.
February 2021, congressional hearings on
market manipulation. Uh and then present
postevent price stabilization. Key data
points short interest peaked at 140%
afloat. Retail trading volume increased
10fold during squeeze. Trading
restrictions implemented a peak. Hedge
fund Melvin Capital sustained 53% uh
loss requiring bail bailout.
An analyst fundamental value estimates
$10 to $40 per share. So let's look at
the first critical first step. So it is
uh the critical first step is to verify
the statement GameStop traded at 4 cents
in August 2020 against actual historical
data. If incorrect document accurate
figures and determine appropriate
communication approach for correcting
the professor. So, uh, what I would do
is I would say after looking at the data
in Yahoo Finance, I've come to the
conclusion that Gamestock stock was
priced at $167
in August 2020. So, if we look at Yahoo
Finance
and then look for August 2020,
we can see it it closed at $167.
So
after doing that critical step uh so to
investigate the GameStop short squeeze
as a case study to test the efficient
market hypothesis. I will analyze price
behavior against EMH predictions,
evaluate behavioral finance explanations
and assess whether the event created
systematic profitable opportunities for
rational investors. So the three main
questions I'm going to be answering are
which firm of market efficiency was
violated? What behavioral biases and
market micro structure issues best
explain anomaly? Did this event create a
repeatable profit opportunity for
rational investors?
So let's go to the represent stage. In
the implement stage, I will be using the
S&P 500 as a benchmark to compare the
data from GameStop. In order to do this,
I will be getting the data from S&P 500
and GameStop from January 1st to
February 1st, 2022.
So, we we'll be using the abnormal
return calculation to find the abnormal
return. And let's look at the
definitions of or what it means for each
market efficiency. So, for a weak market
efficiency, prices reflect all past
price and volume information. For
semi-trong prices reflect all publicly
available information and strong prices
reflect all information including
private information.
So in the implement stage I asked Gemini
to give me a way to visualize the data
in using the
cumulative abnormal return.
So this is what it gave me. Uh we can
look at the the code here. So it defined
the tickers in Windows. It used uh
GameStop and S&P 500. A normal period
before the squeeze. Uh we will use the
full year 2020 to calculate alpha and
beta. So from January 1st, 2020 to uh
December 31st.
the 10day period around trading halt. Um
so as stated earlier is uh 2021 January
28th
and then calculate the daily returns and
then run regression to find alpha and
beta
calculate abnormal returns in the window
and finally plot the final results. So
if we look at the graph here um we see
that it starts from January January 21st
and then it goes up to February 3rd. Uh
as we can see um from January 1st uh to
January 27th uh it grew drastically. Uh
this means that the market was
inefficient and symbolized the hurting
and the market structure failing. Uh
this is not due to new information about
the company's value. That is something
important to note. The drop off on
January 28th is due to brokers
restricting buying. This provides
evidence of the form of market
efficiency that was violated being semi-
strong when the negative information the
restriction became public. The price
reacted instantly. As we can see here on
January 28th, uh there's a dash line and
on from January 27th to January 28th it
lost
0
uh like 08.
So I also asked Gemini to give me a way
to look at the risk.
So uh here
see define the time periods calculate
the volatility
uh and then print the results.
So if we look at the data here we have
the normal daily volatility uh in 2020
7.46% 46% and then during the squeeze
daily volatility is 41.89%.
So analysis the volatility risk during
the squeeze was 5.6 times higher than
normal. This demonstrates the extremely
high risk for the stock in January. Uh
the risk during the squeeze was 5.6
times higher than the risk in 2020. This
explains why Melvin Capital sustained a
53% loss. The volatility was also
increasing daily, which means that this
investment wasn't a repeatable one
instead of one-time event. And to look
at the drop off um from the stock, uh I
see it says Gamestock stock uh closes
down more than 40% after brokers place
restrictions on trades. We can see it
says GameStop closed at $193.60 60 cents
per share down 44.3% from Wednesday's
Wednesday's closing price closing
closing price.
So it looks like the data looks about
right from this graph here. Okay. So to
evolve um I wanted to look at active
versus passive investors and how they
were affected. So passive investors uh
were mainly unaffected uh because those
who are passive investors invest in
index funds like the S&P 500 and don't
generally try to beat the market while
active investors attempt to identify and
capitalize on market inefficiencies. So
since this was a inefficient market in
GameStop uh they would be more
interested in the GameStop stock. uh
some investors were rewarded while
others like Melvin Capital would suffer
significant losses. As stated earlier,
they sustained a 50 53% loss and
required a bailout. So what did this
event demonstrate? It demonstrated that
inefficiencies are very unpredictable
and rarely provide consistent
opportunities for existing returns.
Melbourne Capital was one of those uh
that was unable to predict the the
inefficient market and lost a lot. So to
reflect in this event, we able to see
that the form of market efficiency that
was violated was a semi- strong
efficient market. The market biases that
explained the anomaly were the hurting
and the limits to arbitrage. It proves
that inefficient markets are not easily
or safely exploitable.
That is all. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Hillary Tobias, and this is my video for the Session 8 Assignment. I'll start with the Define & Discover stage of the DRIVER framework. The objective for this assignment is to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021 as a case study. For the scope and horizon of this assignment, I will use historical stock data from January 2020 through June of 2021 to analyze the event and understand its present-day implications. A constraint for this assignment is that it could potentially be difficult to find information on the event since it happened almost 5 years ago, but I don't think that should be too difficult. My success metric for this assignment will be understanding connections between the GameStop event, Efficient Market Hypothesis, and behavioral finance. And my benchmark for this assignment will be the S&P 500 index because it is representative of the whole market. Continuing with the Define & Discover stage of the DRIVER framework, I will go over the data inventory of what was provided for this assignment. I was first given a timeline, and it started with August of 2020 where GameStop was near bankruptcy levels and the textbook stated that GameStop was trading at just 4 cents per share in August of 2020. The next event was that in September of 2020, Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, acquired a 13% stake in GameStop. Then the next event was that in January 2021, the GameStop stock price surged to $483 per share. And this was driven by a Reddit page called Wall Street Bets. And then in February of 2021, there were congressional hearings on market manipulation. And finally, in present day, the stock price of GameStop has stabilized.

Also for the data inventory, I was given some key data points for this situation. It said that short interest peaked at 140% of float. Retail trading volume increased 10-fold during the squeeze. Trading platforms such as Robinhood implemented restrictions at the peak of the squeeze. The large hedge fund called Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss during the squeeze and required a bailout. And analysts estimated that the fundamental value of the GameStop stock was just about $10 to $40 per share during this whole event. Moving on to the Represent stage of the DRIVER framework. I came up with seven steps that I will go through in order to complete this assignment. My first step will be to verify the information that was provided. My second step will be to understand the GameStop short squeeze and all of the events that happened and also define some key terms related to the event. My third step will be to use Python code to visualize this event and compare the returns of GameStop to the market. Step four will be to compare Efficient Market Hypothesis predictions to observed behavior of what actually happened. Step five will be to determine which form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis was violated by this GameStop short squeeze. Step six will be to assess behavioral finance explanations for the observed anomalies. And step seven will be to evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically during this event.

Now I will start the Implement stage of the DRIVER framework and start with the first step in my plan which was to verify all of the provided information. I did this by asking Google Gemini to verify the event timeline and key data points that were provided. And I also asked Gemini to provide me with its references so that I could ensure it was giving me reliable results. And I found that everything was correct except for the stock price of August 2020. The textbook stated that GameStop was trading at just $0.04 in August of 2020, but I found that it was actually trading at $1.04 according to Google Finance. But other than that, all of the other information was good. So then I moved on to step two of my plan, which was to understand the GameStop short squeeze and just understand all the key events involved. So, revisiting the timeline that was provided, in August 2020, GameStop was near bankruptcy levels as I noted, trading at just $1.04 per share. So you can see it was really struggling at this time. And then in September 2020, the founder of Chewy, Ryan Cohen, acquired a 13% stake in the company. And it was also announced in the following months that he would be joining their board of directors. So this brought a lot of increased media attention to GameStop and also caused the stock price to increase a little bit. And then by January of 2021, the price of the GameStop stock had surged to $483 per share. And the price surge was driven by a bunch of social media attention from a Reddit page called Wall Street Bets and also a massive wave of individual retail investors. Users of this Reddit page noticed that large hedge funds were betting on GameStop crashing. So whenever you bet on a stock crashing, it is called short selling, which is when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, anticipating that the price will decline and they will be able to later repurchase it for a profit. So, for example, an investor might borrow a security that is currently worth $10 and sell it for $10 on the market. And then if the price declines as they are betting it is going to, down to say $3, then they will repurchase the security for $3 and then they have just made a $7 profit. Short selling is very risky because if stock prices don't decline like the investor think it's going to and the stock prices actually increase, they can rise indefinitely which means that the short seller can lose more than their initial investment. So, with a really large number of GameStop stocks shorted, the Reddit users realized that they could buy more and more GameStop stock and push the price up and this would somewhat punish the large hedge fund investors because then they would be required to repurchase their shares at a higher price.

So, the massive price increase in the GameStop stock did lead to a short squeeze, which occurs when the price of a stock increases unexpectedly, compelling short sellers to buy back their stocks at a higher price. So and then whenever the investors buy back their stocks during a short squeeze that continues to push the stock price even higher. So, the overall effect of a short squeeze is a rapid and chaotic response from investors as they all try to exit their positions and cover their positions.

And then the next event on the timeline was that in February of 2021, there were congressional hearings on market manipulation. And during this time there were complaints that it was unfair for trading to be restricted like it was at the peak of this event. And then that triggered an investigation into potential manipulation. And the last event on the timeline is that the stock price of GameStop has stabilized currently and it is currently trading at about $21 per share.

I will continue with the Implement stage of the DRIVER framework and move on to step two of my plan which was really understanding this GameStop short squeeze. So, the key data points that were provided for the assignment, the first one was that short interest peaked at 140% of float, and short interest is the number of shares sold short as a portion of total shares outstanding. So, the fact that short interest was 140% means that there were more shares sold short than the number of shares outstanding, which means that the same shares were shorted multiple times. And just for comparison, short interest ratios are usually less than 15%, so 140% is an extremely high number. The next key data point was that retail trading volume increased ten-fold during the squeeze. So as the price of the stock increased, so did the trading volume. There were huge increases in the number of individual retail investors trading GameStop stock daily and on January 22nd of 2021, 197.2 million GameStop shares were traded. The next point is that trading restrictions were implemented at the peak of the squeeze, and it gave Robinhood as an example. So, what happened was brokerages like Robinhood were unable to immediately meet the massive collateral requirements, so they restricted the buying of really volatile stocks such as GameStop to reduce their risk exposure and lower their collateral demands. And as I mentioned on the previous slide, this then raised a question as to if these restrictions were fair or not. The next point is that the hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss that required a bailout. And this is an example of how large hedge funds were forced to repurchase their stocks at higher prices than what they sold them for. And it demonstrates the massive losses that short sellers may suffer during a short squeeze. And the final point is that analysts estimated that the true value of the stock was just about $10 to $40 per share while it was trading for hundreds of dollars. And this indicates that there was a market inefficiency in place.

Now I will move on to step three of my plan which was to use Python code to visualize this event. In order to do this I asked Google Gemini to write simple Python code to visualize the event and I asked it to consider things like stock prices, abnormal returns and the CAPM formula. So now I will go to Google Colab and show you my code. So it starts with a comment that explains that this script downloads historical data for GameStop and the S&P 500 to demonstrate the abnormal return that occurred during the 2021 short squeeze, which is a key anomaly in the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The code starts by first downloading or installing the libraries that it needs and then it sets up the tickers which is 'GME' for GameStop and 'SPY' for the S&P 500. Next, it sets the dates for the event. So, it is going to pull data from January 1st of 2020 through June 30th of 2021. So we can see what the returns looked like before the event, during, and after.

The next section of code is where it downloads the price data and it downloads it from the database called Stooq and it sorts the data and cleans it up to make sure that it is good to use. And it also has code that will handle any missing data and give a message if there are any errors that occur. And then the next thing that the code does is calculate the daily returns, and then it uses those daily returns to calculate the cumulative returns and then it plots those results. It starts by plotting the GameStop cumulative returns and then plots the S&P 500. And it says that the date is going to be on the x axis and the cumulative returns will be on the y- axis. And then it adds titles to the plot and labels for the axes. And then it also adds a vertical line that will mark the peak of the short squeeze. And then it adds a legend to the plot. And finally has code that will display the plot. So now I will run the code. And you can see it says it's downloading and calculating the data. And then this is the graph that it produced. So you can see the date is on the x-axis, the cumulative return is on the y-axis. And this red line shows the cumulative return of GameStop. And the blue line is the cumulative return of the S&P 500. And the gray line indicates the peak of the short squeeze, which occurred on January 28th of 2021. So you can see that prior to the short squeeze event, the cumulative returns of GameStop and the market were pretty similar and the CAPM formula would likely predict that the GameStop stock would continue to move with the market while also taking into account the beta of GameStop. And so the fact that the red and blue lines are together at the beginning of 2020 show kind of normal returns and what you would expect, but then this large gap that formed between the red and blue lines during and after the short squeeze event show massive abnormal returns. And the fact that there were these large abnormal returns indicates that the GameStop event did violate the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

So now I will go back to my slides and I will move on to step four of my plan which was to compare Efficient Market Hypothesis predictions to observed behavior. The Efficient Market Hypothesis states that all pertinent information is already incorporated into prices in an efficient market and therefore there are no undervalued or overvalued stocks and there is no way to beat the market. So considering these things, I will compare what the EMH predicts should happen and what actually happened in this GameStop event. Starting with stock price, the EMH predicts that the price is a rational reflection of the fundamental value of a company. And the fundamental value includes things like future earnings, assets, and debt. And from the GameStop situation, we saw that the price was completely detached from its fundamental value. The fundamental value was estimated to be about $10 to $40 per share, but the price was $483 per share. So, you can see that the price was not a true reflection of the fundamental value. Then in regard to information, the Efficient Market Hypothesis predicts that the price of the stock will only move with new public information about fundamentals like earnings reports and new product lines. However, in this situation, we observed that the price moved based on nonfundamental public information from social media like Reddit and the whole narrative and the hype of the whole situation. In regard to investor behavior, the Efficient Market Hypothesis predicts that investors are rational, and they analyze all of the information that is available to them before making their decisions. However, with the GameStop situation, we observed that people were irrational and they were buying the GameStop stock simply because everyone else was buying the stock and they were not buying based on rational valuation. When it comes to market opportunities, the EMH predicts that it is impossible to beat the market and profitable opportunities that do exist will be immediately arbitraged away by rational investors. However, in the GameStop situation, it was observed that there was an obvious inefficiency demonstrated by the 140% short interest. And this was publicly identified and exploited by retail investors. And then finally, when it comes to price movement, the Efficient Market Hypothesis predicts that prices follow a random walk and are not predictable based on historical prices. However, in the GameStop situation, we observed that prices were following a self-reinforcing loop. So, rising prices brought more attention to the stock, which drove more people to buy the stock, which drove prices higher, and so on. And that loop just continued, and the price got caught in this predictable loop.

Next, I will move on to step five of my plan, which was to determine which form of Efficient Market Hypothesis was violated. So, there are three forms of market efficiency that are part of Efficient Market Hypothesis. The first form is called weak form and that form states that past price movements are not useful for predicting future prices, stock prices reflect all current information, and technical analysis does not work. The second form is semi-strong form and that states that stocks adjust quickly to absorb new public information, only private information is useful to gain an advantage, and fundamental analysis does not work. And the third form is strong form and that states that market prices reflect all public and private information, so insider trading does not work. The form that was violated by the GameStop situation was the semi-strong form and this form claims that stocks adjust to new public information, so it is impossible to achieve any abnormal returns by trading on information that is publicly available. However, in the GameStop situation, the short interest data and all the social media sentiment was all public information and the market did not adjust to that. The abnormal returns persisted for several days as was shown in the graph that was generated by my code. Now I will move on to step six of my plan which was to assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies. So, the first anomaly that was observed was that there was this massive, synchronized buying from millions of independent retail investors. And the behavioral finance explanation for that is herd behavior, which is when people tend to mimic the financial behaviors of the majority of the herd. So, in this case, seeing a growing crowd investing in GameStop attracted new investors, which drove the price up and pulled in a bigger crowd, which continued to draw the price up. And so people weren't buying based on their own analysis, they were just buying because everyone else was and they were just following the herd. The second anomaly that was observed was that investors held the stock even as its price plummeted. And the explanation for this is loss aversion, which refers to the fact that people feel losses more acutely than equivalent gains. And this causes people to hold on to stocks that are losing because they still have hope that the stock will return to its higher price. And then the third anomaly that was observed was the dismissal of negative news such as analyst reports and warnings from short sellers. And the explanation for this is confirmation bias, which refers to the human tendency to search for, favor, and recall information that confirms your pre-existing beliefs. So through social media, people built a one-sided view of reality, and they only believed what they wanted to, and they wanted to believe that the stock price would continue to climb, and this caused them to exhibit irrational behavior. Overall, these behavioral finance explanations show how psychological factors and biases caused people to act irrationally, which contributed to the market inefficiencies and abnormal returns during this GameStop event. Now, I will move on to step seven of my plan, which was to evaluate whether a rational investor could have profited systematically during this event. And the answer to that is yes. If a rational investor was able to see through the narrative and the hype surrounding this situation and understand that it was really just a temporary deviation from the true value of the stock, they would have been able to profit. One thing they could have done was buy both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date, which is essentially betting that the price would move dramatically but not betting on the direction of the movement. So they basically could have just bet that the price is going to either go up or down by a lot and they didn't have to pick a direction, and they would have been able to profit on that. And another thing they could have done was bet on the inevitable collapse by buying put options or short selling at the peak of the short squeeze.

Now I'll move on to the Validate stage of the DRIVER framework. In order to validate my analysis, I verified all of the information that was provided and I corrected it when necessary, such as the August 2020 stock price. I also checked multiple sources to verify my information whenever I was ensuring everything was correct and also doing research on the Efficient Market Hypothesis and behavioral finance elements. And then I also ensured that the graph from my code made sense. I double checked that the market remained steady over time and that the GameStop short squeeze peak was identified on the correct date, and it was, so that was all good.

Now moving on to the Evolve stage of the DRIVER framework. This case study can be used to inform my own investment strategy. This case shows that the market is mostly efficient but not completely rational because people are not rational. And so an investment strategy based on this could be a combination of passive and active management. I would probably do about 80 to 90% passive management. And I would invest in broad market index funds. So by doing this, I would be accepting the market's average return, minimizing transaction fees, and really capturing the steady long-term growth of the economy. And this would also avoid the chaos that ensued in the GameStop situation. And then the other 10 to 20% I could actively manage. And I would do this by applying insights from the observed anomalies from the situation, such as not getting caught in herd behavior, loss aversion or confirmation bias. And then I would also try to be rational even when others are irrational. And one way to do this would be to bet on the collapse of a bubble rather than going down with the collapse.

Finally, I will move on to the Reflect stage of the DRIVER framework. So, this GameStop short squeeze is an example that markets are mostly efficient, but inefficiencies still exist at times, and those inefficiencies can be explained by behavioral finance. As we saw from the graph that my code generated, the market did appear to be efficient prior to the short squeeze as the GameStop and market returns moved pretty much together. But then major inefficiencies occurred when behavioral finance elements were present, and those elements were herd behavior, loss aversion and confirmation bias. So this indicated that when people behave irrationally, markets tend to react irrationally. So Efficient Market Hypothesis and behavioral finance come together to explain why markets work the way they do. Efficient Market Hypothesis explains the fact that markets are mostly efficient. But then behavioral finance comes in to explain that irrational behavior from humans can create inefficiencies in markets at times. So overall this assignment taught me a lot about understanding the whole GameStop short squeeze event. I learned a lot of new terminology, such as short squeeze and short interest. And then it also taught me about the three different forms of Efficient Market Hypothesis and how behavioral finance can be used to explain market inefficiencies. And then another large takeaway is a good investment strategy that will combine passive and active management, and I think this will be really useful in my future. Thanks!

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Andrea Typaldos and in session 8, I'm looking at one big question. If my model says GameStop is worth $12, but the market price is 200, then who's wrong? Is it me because my model is missing something? The market since it might be a bubble or a market just weird mixing fundamentals with psychology. That's the tension between market efficiency and behavioral finance. and I'll walk through how I think about it using driver. First, for driver, I define and discover and I define the problem. My core question is how efficient are markets really and what does that mean for my analysis and my strategy. My goals in this session are to understand the efficient market hypothesis also known as EMH. Uh it can be either weak, semi-strong or strong form. Then to connect EMH to real strategies like technical analysis, fundamental analysis and passive indexing. And third to bring in behavioral finance, how biases and hurting can make prices move away from fundamentals. This session is basically about answering this question. When should I trust market prices and when is there a chance to earn alpha? To represent uh the I now I have to represent the ideas with simple frame frameworks. First, EMH in plain language. Uh, I already divided it into three categories. Weak, semi, and strong. A weak form. In when they're in weak form, prices already reflect past prices and volumes. That means chart patterns shouldn't give easy profits. If it's semi-strong, prices reflect all public information, including financial statements, news, and earnings. And this means basic fundamental analysis shouldn't consistently beat beat the market. If it's in a strong form, prices reflect all the information, even the private one. And that means even insider trading wouldn't work, which we know is unrealistic, basically. Second, the event study picture to test efficiency around an event like earnings I think in three basic windows uh with the code I'm going to show um well the code you're seeing right now before the announcement is in minus 10 days to minus one and the event date would be day zero and after the announcement would be would be + one to plus five or 10 days For each day, I can compute the expected return from CAPM and the abnormal return, which the formula is actual return minus expected return. If markets are semi-strong efficient, most abnormal return should show up on day zero, not slowly over several days. Third, the behavioral finance overlay. Then I layer on behavioral ideas could be overcompetence, anchoring, hurting, loss aversion, mental accounting and abnormalities like momentum, value effect and size effect. This lets me compare the clean EMH world versus the real world with humans and biases. Next step is to implement with my Python code that you can see here. Now I implement a simple event study style simulation in Python. And I'll explain really quickly what I'm doing. I'm simulating daily market returns from day minus 5 to day + 5. Um using a beta to compute the stock's normal return. And I add a big positive surprise on day zero. I also add a small drift for a few days after and compute abnormal returns and see how much of the total move happens on day zero. When I run this code, I see abnormal returns before event which should be close to zero and a big um and a big abnormal return on day zero and the small a smaller abnormal returns on day 1 to three. The efficient ratio tells me what share of the total reaction happened immediately. If most of it is on day zero, markets look mostly efficient and if a lot happens later, that looks more like a drift in possible efficiency. So here is my complete code and when I run oh sorry when I run it you can see here um the post earning announcement drift simulation with all the percentages in market stock and AR and the day from minus zero sorry from minus 5 to five and here I also put a summary um so then I validate And the next step in the driver framework is to validate. And in validate I ask myself is this pattern real or is it just noise? And I have to check first statistical significance which means that are average like I have to ask myself are average abnormal returns really different from zero. Then I check economic significant significance where I ask myself are they big enough to matter after fees and trading costs. Then I have to check persistence where I ask myself does this pattern show up across many stocks and time periods not just one lucky sample meaning are there any outliers basically if it if the drift is tiny or disappears when I include costs the prob it's probably not an exploitable inefficiency um then next step in the next step in the driver framework I evolve and in evolve I apply the lesson more broadly Let's say for big liquid markets my view is mostly efficient then there may still be pockets of inefficiency uh especially where information is complex attention is limited or behavioral biases are strong that suggests a hybrid strategy which I should use passive index funds as a core to respect efficiency and I should add targeted active strategies only where there is good evidence of persistent abnormalities. ities. My last step in the driver framework is to reflect and I reflect on what this means. I decided to reflect in this session what this means for me as an analyst as an analyst personally. Uh first of all, I shouldn't assume the market is dumb just because my model says a different number. Second, I learned that EMH gives me a discipline check. Prices usually contain a lot of information. Uh and thirdly, behavioral finance reminds me that humans are not fully rational and sometimes that creates opportunities. So my big takeaway is to treat the market prices as a strong sharing point but not as the final truth and to combine respect for efficiency with healthy skepticism and a datadriven search for real validated anormalities. And well, that's my driver walkthrough for session 8 and my code. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"prefacing the assignment in terms of the objective is to investigate the GME event against the EMH and to verify the specific price claims that are within the assignment. Uh in terms of the scope and horizon, I'm analyzing GME with this GameStop and its daily price data focused on August 20 August of 2020 to Mar the March 2021 time frame. In terms of constraints, the most critical task is the first question that I asked which is to verify the statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. In terms of data inventory, I have the event timeline analyst estimates of about $10 to $40 somewhere within that range. And so, first I need to pull the actual historical data. In terms of a successful metric, it's a clear data back answer for each of the five required analysis questions, which I'll get into next. And in terms of a benchmark, my analysis would be benchmark against the two numbers, which is a 4 cents the 4 cents claim, and then the $10 to $40 of fundamental value estimate that I provided earlier. Next, in terms of what I go into next, my plan here is to import white finance. as you can see right here and then create one data gathering function called get key data for each of the five separate um uh each of the five separate um functions for one of each for each required analysis question. So you get as you see you get like analysis one analysis two. Yes. And then I'll start by moving on to each of the questions. So the question that the first the first question that it asks here is what I said earlier in terms of verifying the four cents claim. So in order to do that I use the wife finance like I said earlier um it so it would this here the ticker history it would just go through um all of the Y finance and then find the numbers for those particular months. As you can see, you get like the August low August low date and things like that here. And then from the output, you can see that it actually wasn't 4 cents as the lowest split adjusted low price for GME in August of 2020 was $1, which was on the 3rd of August of 2020. So, we can conclude that the 4 cent claim is incorrect and that the actual low was $1, which is 25 times higher than the claim. Next moving on to our second uh question that we need to answer which is test which form of market efficiency was violated. This function provides a real number to answer this question. So in order to do that the script would compare the peak price against the fundamental benchmark of $10 to $40 like I said earlier. And then as you can see in this output here, you can see that the price surged to uh $483 in January of 2021. Uh and that's a claim for the unadjusted price. As it says right here, the 44 for one split means the adjusted equivalent is $120.75. And so we found that the highest split adjusted high price for GME in January 2021 was $120.75 on December 20 uh January 28th of 2021. In terms of a conclusion, we can say that the $483 claim given in the question is correct as it corresponds to the split adjusted peak of $120.75. That's the second part of Okay. In terms of analysis two, we'll go back here. Let me find it real quick. Yes. So, in terms of analysis two, we just go in, you know, it just finds numbers for us here. So, for analysis 2, it finds the market price like I said earlier, that was in the earlier thing that I said, which is a peak of $120.75 as you see here with my cursor. And in terms of a benchmark, we find that the all public fundamental analysis put the estimate value at somewhere between $10 to $40. Then we found that the pricing peaked at three times its highest rational estimate. And so by that we can conclude that the uh weak form is violated as the squeeze was a momentum event based on past price action. Uh the semi- strong one was also clearly violated. Well, the first one was arguably. The second one was clearly violated as the price was completely detached from all public info. And then the strong form was violated as well as the price was driven by a mechanical squeeze and social narrative and not superior private information. Third, talking about analysis three here answers what evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically. This function provides the real numbers. There's this question and so just prints numbers from all the data that we had previously loaded through Y finance. So in order to do that we can see that the rational investor by EMA standards would value GME at about $10 to $40. Like I said earlier this rational investor would have shorted shorted the stock or stayed out leading to massive losses. uh a value investor buying in 2020 paid about maybe $2.13 per share from what I gathered and then the value investor could have sold at a peak of about $120.75. Uh and so conclude the answer to the question would be no and that the rational investor could not have systematically profited as the event was a singular anomaly and not a repeatable system. So next moving on to number four here it asks compare efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior and so in order to do that we have to find the EMH prediction the observed behavior the gap and then the EMH prediction as like I said earlier just using those numbers again from back and then um let's see here from the code you can see that all we're doing is comparing EMH uh predictions versus the observed behavior. We can see that the price should be a rational reflection of the fundamental value. Um the observed behavior is that the price hit $125.75 as I said earlier on January 28th of 2021. In terms of the gap, the observed price was $80.75 higher than the top end fundamental estimate. So in terms of the prediction, we can see that the price adjusts instantly and biasly to new public information. The observed behavior is that the price built a low chaotic bubble bubble from September of 2020 to January of 2021, then crashed. This was a biased herd driven and inefficient adjustment. So next, moving on to the na last analysis section. Uh let's see here. It's right here. Assess behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies. And so from this code here, you can see that the anomaly is explained by the price gap of $80.75, which is the difference between the $120.75% peak and the fundamental high of $40. EMH as we can tell here is the that EMH cannot explain this gap but behavioral finance can as a in terms of hurting and social proof as that the Wall Street bets were acting as collective the narrative fally which is the whole David and Goliath thing as it became more powerful than the company's balance sheet and then also a short squeeze as short sellers face unlimited potential loss forcing them to buy back at any irrational price to calculate their losses. And so to end all of this, uh, through all this, I learned that the, well, the first thing I learned was that the 4centent claim was incorrect, but the $483 claim was correct. Data clearly showed a massive quantifiable violation of the semi-strong image due to my behavioral factors. And then the last part I would say next another step that someone could take would be to analyze trading volume to quantify the 10-fold retail increase or the impact of the uh Robin Hood uh restrictions.

Simon and
0:10
says, ""Investigate market efficiency
0:13
using the GameStop short squeeze event
0:15
of 2020 2021 as a case study. Verify the
0:20
accuracy of state facts. Analyze price
0:23
behavior relative to efficient market
0:25
hypothesis predictions and evaluate
0:28
whether market anomalies constitute
0:32
evidence against market efficiency or
0:34
can be explained within existing frame
0:37
works. And the critical first step is to
0:39
verify the game the statement GameStop
0:42
traded at 0
0:44
uh 4 cents in August 2020 against actual
0:47
historic data historical data. If
0:49
incorrect, document the accurate figures
0:51
and determine appropriate communication
0:53
post for correcting the professor.
0:56
Okay, before we get into the collab,
0:57
we're going to get into this.
1:02
So, give me a second.
1:05
All right.
1:09
So, the provided analysis of GameStop
1:12
short squeeze identify several behavior
1:15
concepts that help explain the event.
1:16
these concepts just that the market
1:18
during that period was driven by
1:19
rational rationality and emotional
1:22
trading rather than purely rational
1:23
decision making based on fundamentals.
1:26
So the here are some behavior uh biases
1:29
and impacts according to the event that
1:32
happened and I'm just going to read off
1:34
all of them. So the bias was about
1:37
hurting and and basically was when
1:39
traders copied each other's actions uh
1:42
primarily coordinated on social media
1:44
platforms like Reddit and what that led
1:47
to was massive retail buying and it
1:50
created initial price spike in momentum.
1:53
So uh overconfidence was one and it was
1:57
when retail traders believed they could
2:00
beat the be wall street by collectively
2:03
driving up the price and this caused
2:05
traders to ignore fundamental valuation
2:07
signals. Um and it pushed the price far
2:10
beyond what was warranted. And there was
2:12
FOMO uh which was late buyers that felt
2:15
pressure to enter the trade to
2:16
participate in the perceived massive
2:18
gains. And uh this drove bubble behavior
2:21
with buyers buyers entering at peak
2:24
prices and it contributed to the rapid
2:25
runup and anchoring which was when
2:28
traders focused on past low prices of
2:30
the stock and that caused traders to
2:32
misjudge future value and the actual
2:34
risk of the trade as the price rose
2:36
dramatically and there was limits to
2:39
arbitrage and it was a structural
2:41
factors like trading halts and the
2:42
extreme short interest which made it
2:44
difficult for rational traders
2:47
to execute trades to correct mispricing
2:49
quickly and it and this prevented an
2:51
immediate market correction allowing the
2:53
price bubble to inflate further and
2:56
prolonging the short-term inefficiency.
2:58
So the challenging market efficiency
3:02
um
3:04
for short-term and long-term was that
3:05
for short-term the price did not simply
3:07
reflect on only new fundamental
3:10
information. Instead they reflected
3:12
hype, coordination and emotional buying.
3:14
The huge positive abnormal returns
3:18
confirm this short-term violation
3:21
and
3:25
to
3:28
yeah and then so that's for one of them
3:31
and then for the for the event study
3:34
market model estimation equation was
3:36
this right here
3:40
then I submitted the parameters of alpha
3:42
and beta by using daily log returns
3:44
during the pre-event window which was
3:46
from June 1st, 2020 to December 31st
3:49
um 2020
3:52
and the stat model output
3:56
provided the specific values for these
3:58
parameters and for the alpha this the
3:59
intercept of the regression representing
4:01
the expected daily return of GME when
4:04
the S&P 500 return is zero the beta it's
4:06
the slope of the regression it represent
4:08
the GME systematic risk or sensitivity
4:11
to the market typical pre-squeeze beta
4:14
for Jimmy was likely close to or
4:16
slightly above 1.0 indicated that it
4:18
moved roughly with the market.
4:22
And for the abnormal return, I used the
4:25
estimated uh alpha and beta to calculate
4:28
the expected return for each day in the
4:29
event window from January 11 to 28 some
4:32
21. I did all this sample.
4:38
So to interpret the results, there was a
4:40
huge positive abnormal returns. The
4:42
sharp spike in car between January 13
4:45
and January 28, 2021 confirms that
4:47
Jeremy's returns was were uh vastly
4:50
greater than what systematic risk mod
4:52
could explain. This is the quantitative
4:54
evidence of the short-term market
4:56
efficiency semi strong efficiency
4:58
breakdown. Just the price surge was not
5:01
justified by any equivalent release of
5:03
positive fundamental public information.
5:05
The semi- strong form of EMA was clearly
5:09
violated and prices reflected high
5:10
coordination and short covering pressure
5:13
and efficiency restoration
5:16
rapid drop in CR in early February
5:18
suggest that N that rational forces and
5:20
fundamental valuations $10 to $40 begin
5:23
to restore efficiency after the
5:24
immediate bubble burst.
5:32
Okay. And
5:39
basically I talked about the behavioral
5:41
rational
5:44
and such.
5:46
So it included the EMAs forms.
6:00
So if we looking for the code that I
6:02
did, it's the import finance. Um
6:06
downloading the data, the GME, the SPF,
6:09
SPX, excuse me. It's the daily log
6:12
returns. you can find and the estimate
6:15
the alpha and the beta for here and then
6:18
the abnormal returns
6:21
this the plot cumulative normal returns
6:25
see our
6:28
and the study strongly suggest the
6:30
conclusion that Jimmy short squeeze was
6:32
a temporary but severe breakdown of
6:34
market efficiency and it was driven by
6:36
behavioral biases and structural factors
6:40
detailed in your in my uh evolve
6:45
Evolve section.
7:04
Technically the whole thing was just
7:08
behavioral thing and it wasn't really
7:11
rational.
7:13
It was like it says here, it was
7:15
temporary and it was it was very severe
7:18
for the market. Uh look for it to be
7:20
efficient and

",FALSE,1,"All right. So, recession 8, market efficiency and behavioral finance. The question is, are markets perfectly rational or are we all just predictably crazy? Here's section one, the financial hook, the analysis paradox. You spent weeks analyzing GameStop using every technique from sessions one through six. Your CAPM based valuation sells intrinsic value of $12 per share, but the stock is trading at $200. Three explanations in your mind. Explanation one, I'm wrong. Um, so our analysis missed something important. The market knows information we don't have. Better analysts have driven the price to fair value. Explanation two, the market is wrong. Retail investor mania has created a bubble. Fundamental analysis reveals mispricing. Patient value investors will eventually profit. And explanation three, markets are weird. Prices reflect psychology as much as fundamentals. Behavioral biases create systematic patterns and traditional models miss important market dynamics. Um so here's a timeline visual visualization. Um here's a traditional theory. So fundamental value of $12 intrinsic rational analysis professional traders and the current market price should be $12 but here's the reality that we reser observe 200 mark dollar price actual trading. So which time represents how markets actually work and this session will examine the tension between theoretical and observed market behavior uh which is crucial for understanding when uh our analysis can beat market consensus. So our learning goal with AI is developing a sophic sophisticated understanding of how market efficiency theory impacts practical investment investment analysis and strategic development. Um and so we go on. So quick knowledge check. What is the efficient market hypothesis claim? Stock prices reflect all available information. Uh according to strong form market efficiency which strategy should not work. Insider trading. What is anchoring bias? Over relying on the first piece of information received. And if markets are semi- strong efficient, what information is already reflected in stock prices? All publicly available information. And so we go into section two, the efficient market hypothesis. And our EMH principle um stock practice fully reflect all available information making it impossible to consistently achieve abnormal returns through analysis of publicly available data. So there's three forms of market efficiency. Weak form prices reflect all past price and volume information. Technical analysis doesn't work. Semi- strong form prices reflect all publicly available information. Fundamental analysis doesn't work. Strong form prices reflect all information including private information. Insider trading doesn't work. So our key implications are random walk. Future price changes are unpredictable. No free lunch risk adjusted returns cannot consistently beat market information efficiency. New information is quickly incorporated into prices. And so we move on to part two where we testing where we're testing the market efficiency. And again, here's our timeline again. Normal returns, abnormal returns, and then after event return to normal. In efficient market, price adjusts immediately to new information. An inefficient market price adjust slowly or overreacts. Here's the abnormal return calculation. And then part three, behavioral finance challenges. Common behavioral biases, overconfidence, investors overestimate their analytical abilities, anchoring, over relying on first piece of information received, hurting, following crowd behavior rather than independent analysis, loss aversion, feeling losses more acutely than equivalent gains, mental accounting, treating money differently based on its source. Um, and their market anomalies, momentum, past winners continue winning in short-term value effects, low PE stocks outperform high PE stocks. size effect. Small companies outperform large companies in January effect. Um, small stocks perform especially well in January. So, our learning goal with EMH forms and trading strategy selection is mastering the practical implications of different market efficiency level levels for developing appropriate investment strategies. And here's uh our prompt that we put into, you know, GPT or Gemini. Uh I'm analyzing how different forms of EMH should guide strategy selection yada yada yada. Um what evidence do fund managers use to justify active management supposedly efficient markets and so why this shows a professional strategy development? You know efficiency thinking, strategy matching, cross market awareness, evidence-based decision- making. And here we go on to part four practical applications for analysis. So or strong efficiency use passive index investing semi-rong efficiency focus on private information and superior analysis weak efficiency fundamental analysis can work technical analysis cannot inefficient markets multiple strategies can generate alpha and then our connections to our previous sessions. Sessions 1 through six valuation assumes you can find mispriced securities. Session seven examines whether mispricing actually exists and persists and sessions 8 through 12 apply insights to corporate financial decisions and um we go on into the partner practice. So keep going through that and then we get into section four um our driver learning guide and then here's a case scenario for the coaching post earnings announcement drift analysis technology stock reported earnings 15% above consensus estimates stock rose 5% on announcement day but continues rising 1% daily for the next week question does this gradual price adjustment represent market inefficiency or rational information processing and here's our analysis framework market prediction observe pattern and then investigation is this inefficiency irrational adjustment to complex information. And so we move on to Discover frame the efficiency investigation. So our goal is to design systematics test of market efficiency around earnings announcements. Um so we do this with AI copy this and then our outcome we need to analyze whether continuing price movement represents market inefficiency inefficiency exploitable for profit rational processing of complex information or compensation for additional risk factors not captured in simple models and then we move on to represent. So here we're mapping the efficiency testing framework. Here's a timeline the benchmarks return analysis and then our implementation. So here we're coding the market efficiency analysis and this is obviously starting code. We use um our AI to help us figure out you know what to do with this and then we just validate it. So the robustness efficiency findings our goal return analysis distinguishes true efficiency from statistical noise and um so statistical significance or abnormal return statistically different from zero. Economic significance are profits large enough to overcome transaction costs, persistence and risk adjustment. And we go on to evolve efficiency insights across markets where we just apply our efficiency lessons to other market contexts and investment decisions where we recognize the efficiency patterns in various market settings. And we keep going and then onto the reflect. And so ultimately we did synthesize insights about market efficiency for practical investment approach and our approach earnings drift analysis suggests markets are mostly but not perfectly efficient which creates a nuanced investment philosophy. Respect mark respect market wisdom while maintaining healthy skepticism about perfect pricing. And that is it.",,0,1

Transcript
00:00:03 Speaker 1
Hello, for today we'll be going through session 8.
00:00:06 Speaker 1
We'll be talking about the efficiency market hypothesis and this AI slop problem that our professor made.
00:00:16 Speaker 1
I'd be interested to see if the professor's actually grading or if the AI is, because I would like that to be included in my next feedback of my next low grade.
00:00:34 Speaker 1
an AI, I think an AI grades this, but we'll see.
00:00:38 Speaker 1
00:00:40 Speaker 1
First, we're going to define and discover.
00:00:43 Speaker 1
We're going to analyze the GameStop short squeeze to evaluate the efficient market hypothesis.
00:00:51 Speaker 1
We're going to discover and we're going to analyze the critical data verification and see if
00:00:58 Speaker 1
GME traded at 0.04 cents, which is obviously false.
00:01:04 Speaker 1
We'll have our core analysis.
00:01:06 Speaker 1
We'll verify facts.
00:01:07 Speaker 1
We'll test whether the efficient market hypothesis was violated.
00:01:12 Speaker 1
And we're going to ask if a rational investor could systematically profit.
00:01:17 Speaker 1
We're going to compare efficient market predictions to what actually happened.
00:01:22 Speaker 1
We're going to use behavioral finance to explain the anomalies.
00:01:25 Speaker 1
And some of the things we know from this problem is that GameStock was near bankruptcy.
00:01:29 Speaker 1
And then they appointed a new CAO, Ryan Cohen, who bought some stock.
00:01:34 Speaker 1
And then after that, there was a frenzy where GameStock peaked at $483.
00:01:40 Speaker 1
And then in February 2021, Congress investigated if there's any wrongdoing.
00:01:50 Speaker 1
Some key data, 140%
00:01:53 Speaker 1
There was 140% short interest from institutional investors who believed that GameSock would go bankrupt and they would make money on the price of GameSock falling.
00:02:04 Speaker 1
There was 10 times retail volume, probably higher honestly, which we'll prove later, which signified how big it became.
00:02:17 Speaker 1
Rob Hood then restricted the stock of people buying it, which then caused it to fall.
00:02:23 Speaker 1
Melvin Capital, who's one of the short sellers, had a 53% loss.
00:02:29 Speaker 1
And analyst value for the stock was $10 to $40.
00:02:33 Speaker 1
For stage two, we're going to represent and we're going to outline the step-by-step plan and execute the analysis.
00:02:40 Speaker 1
So first, we're going to data, we're going to verify the data.
00:02:45 Speaker 1
See there's stock price.
00:02:49 Speaker 1
Communication, we're going to make this video.
00:02:52 Speaker 1
Efficient market analysis, we're going to test all three efficient market hypothesis forms.
00:02:59 Speaker 1
Semi-strong is the main violation that we'll see.
00:03:03 Speaker 1
Systematic profit analysis, we're going to differentiate the money-making from systematic profit.
00:03:10 Speaker 1
Comparative analysis, we're going to make a table.
00:03:14 Speaker 1
Behavioral assessment, we're going to apply behavioral concepts like curve behavior and narrative to explain the event.
00:03:20 Speaker 1
So obviously this had a lot to do with behavioral finance.
00:03:24 Speaker 1
On stage 3, we're going to implement the analytical plan.
00:03:27 Speaker 1
So now that we know what we're going to do, we're going to execute the data verification.
00:03:32 Speaker 1
So the statement that GameStock traded at 0.04% is apparently incorrect.
00:03:39 Speaker 1
They had a stock split, but the low, 2022 low, was 2.57 split adjusted.
00:03:45 Speaker 1
And the price was around 3 to 4.50.
00:03:48 Speaker 1
So that .04% figure is off by a lot.
00:03:53 Speaker 1
If you go here, GME stock price, we'll go max.
00:04:08 Speaker 1
Nothing around here was lower than 83 cents.
00:04:11 Speaker 1
It looks like, you know, if you scroll through,
00:04:17 Speaker 1
Obviously, there's the bump, but you can see if you just look at a chart that the stock price was not at.04, which would have been like 4 cents.
00:04:30 Speaker 1
We're going to execute and test the market efficiency forms.
00:04:34 Speaker 1
So the weak form was violated.
00:04:36 Speaker 1
There was clear momentum, which allowed traders to profit.
00:04:40 Speaker 1
And it violates the random walk idea that it was random.
00:04:46 Speaker 1
there's a clear upward momentum, which is why people were buying it.
00:04:51 Speaker 1
That was pretty much the only reason why they were buying it.
00:04:53 Speaker 1
And if the weak form was violated, then the other ones are also violated.
00:04:57 Speaker 1
So semi-strong form, public info was not known by most of the retail investors.
00:05:06 Speaker 1
You know, they didn't know the revenues, the financials, and that kind of indicated that it wasn't
00:05:16 Speaker 1
that people didn't have all the information or else they wouldn't have bought the stock, to be honest.
00:05:22 Speaker 1
They're just going off the information they saw on Instagram.
00:05:25 Speaker 1
Strong form violated.
00:05:27 Speaker 1
Like we said, semi-strong is violated.
00:05:30 Speaker 1
Strong forms violated.
00:05:36 Speaker 1
For #4, we're going to evaluate the systematic profit and see if retail and rational investors can practice systematically.
00:05:43 Speaker 1
Systematically.
00:05:45 Speaker 1
The analysis is no.
00:05:46 Speaker 1
Obviously, rationally, GameStock was not worth $480.
00:05:52 Speaker 1
The real price of the stock was, I want to say, I want to say a rational investor could have profited a few dollars, but not to the same extent.
00:06:08 Speaker 1
I think Hello Kitty's or whatever his name was, Tsis, made
00:06:14 Speaker 1
was somewhat rational, but once the stock got a certain point, potentially over like $20, then it became irrational.
00:06:24 Speaker 1
So I think people could profit a little bit at the beginning, but obviously once it got to a certain level, an investor can't systematically make money based on riding the wave.
00:06:38 Speaker 1
They would have seen it as overvalued and as a black swan event.
00:06:42 Speaker 1
So now we're going to execute, we're going to test the efficient market hypothesis predictions compared to the observed behavior.
00:06:51 Speaker 1
So in the efficient market hypothesis, for all information is known, the fundamental value of the stock is around $10 to $40, but the price hit $483.
00:07:01 Speaker 1
People know that 140% is short priced in.
00:07:07 Speaker 1
but people didn't know or care, but then it became explosive fuel once people found out about it.
00:07:15 Speaker 1
The efficient market prediction says it was random, but the price followed a massive coordinated trend from social media, so not true.
00:07:26 Speaker 1
Investors are rational in the efficient market hypothesis, but
00:07:32 Speaker 1
In this situation, they just said, they said, investors said they had diamond hands, which meant they were going to hold the stock regardless of the outcome.
00:07:40 Speaker 1
This is irrational behavior because, you know, the rational thing to do is sell it at the most optimal price, but you're just holding it to make a point.
00:07:50 Speaker 1
So it's not rational.
00:07:54 Speaker 1
And in efficient market, shorters correct the price, but
00:07:58 Speaker 1
They got bankrupt in the scenario, even though they were somewhat right that GameStop was a failed company.
00:08:07 Speaker 1
In an efficient market, you have both sides kind of correcting each other, but in this scenario, the people buying the stock kind of beat the shorters and cause behavior that isn't normal.
00:08:23 Speaker 1
And so now we're going to explain the behavioral finance applications.
00:08:27 Speaker 1
So people act as a herd because other people are doing it.
00:08:31 Speaker 1
They follow the same behavior.
00:08:35 Speaker 1
once somebody sees somebody else having success, they try to copy them and the momentum just spreads because they don't want to get left out.
00:08:42 Speaker 1
Narrative economics, I kind of fell into this category when I wanted to buy some stock.
00:08:47 Speaker 1
It was kind of David Goliath story from the institutional versus retail investors.
00:08:53 Speaker 1
People who are out just to make a buck versus people who actually like
00:09:00 Speaker 1
profited like college savings versus just corporate corporate greed.
00:09:07 Speaker 1
There's overconfidence and confirmation bias.
00:09:11 Speaker 1
Hedge funds underestimated the herd and the herd ignored all the, you know, fundamentals.
00:09:18 Speaker 1
Both were kind of entrenched in their own ways and, you know, were very rational and overcome.
00:09:25 Speaker 1
and didn't really think of the different outcomes that were possible.
00:09:29 Speaker 1
Prospect theory, shorters were in a loss spiral, which forced them to buy back at any price, stopped depleting.
00:09:38 Speaker 1
It's not really an efficient market.
00:09:40 Speaker 1
It's more of a behavioral financing because you can't lose money forever and bank up your company.
00:09:49 Speaker 1
And stage four, we're going to validate our information.
00:09:51 Speaker 1
So we check the stock price.
00:09:54 Speaker 1
We talked about it.
00:09:55 Speaker 1
We tested the efficient market hypothesis forms.
00:09:59 Speaker 1
That's done.
00:10:00 Speaker 1
The systematic prop analysis we did.
00:10:03 Speaker 1
Efficient market versus reality, we did that.
00:10:05 Speaker 1
Behavioral finance apply, we did that.
00:10:08 Speaker 1
So we have successfully validated.
00:10:12 Speaker 1
Now we're going to evolve.
00:10:14 Speaker 1
And I have some code here.
00:10:17 Speaker 1
I imported some of the...
00:10:22 Speaker 1
stock prices and models.
00:10:24 Speaker 1
And then we're going to calculate all these different kind of things, normal returns.
00:10:29 Speaker 1
You have CAPM, things like that.
00:10:31 Speaker 1
would kind of be more fundamentals.
00:10:34 Speaker 1
And then as we go down, you can see the GameStock price, which we talked about earlier, but is now in a code form.
00:10:41 Speaker 1
You can see that it doesn't go under.04.
00:10:44 Speaker 1
The trading volume, it's over
00:10:48 Speaker 1
You can see the rapid spike, which is not a normal occurrence.
00:10:55 Speaker 1
You can see how people are just super interested in this one area.
00:10:58 Speaker 1
And they just started rapidly buying.
00:11:05 Speaker 1
So now for our final analysis.
00:11:10 Speaker 1
The claim that GameStock trade at .04 is incorrect.
00:11:13 Speaker 1
The actual price for that month was in the $3 to $4.50 range.
00:11:20 Speaker 1
So that was correct.
00:11:23 Speaker 1
We're going to talk the violations of market efficiency.
00:11:25 Speaker 1
The weak form was violated.
00:11:28 Speaker 1
There's no random walk theory.
00:11:31 Speaker 1
Semi-strong form severely violated.
00:11:33 Speaker 1
This is the core failure.
00:11:34 Speaker 1
The market failed to price in public data like the 140% short interest.
00:11:39 Speaker 1
And the strong form was violated because the semi-strong was violated.
00:11:45 Speaker 1
Systematic profit.
00:11:47 Speaker 1
No, this is a one-time event and it's not a repealable strategy.
00:11:52 Speaker 1
Rational investors would not have held the stock as it approached 70, 100, 200.
00:11:57 Speaker 1
People would have sold if they were rational because the price, the stock was not worth that based on every fundamental factor imaginable.
00:12:08 Speaker 1
Efficient market hypothesis versus GME reality.
00:12:12 Speaker 1
Price reflects fundamentals and in reality,
00:12:16 Speaker 1
Price reflected a social narrative.
00:12:20 Speaker 1
Obviously, you could see how more behavioral things affected the stock.
00:12:24 Speaker 1
An efficient market hypothesis was kind of let down.
00:12:29 Speaker 1
In theory, shortest correct price, but in reality, arbitrators were bankrupted by the price.
00:12:36 Speaker 1
And in theory, markets are rational, but in reality, the market was driven by her behavior.
00:12:41 Speaker 1
In the conclusion,
00:12:42 Speaker 1
The efficient market hypothesis cannot explain the GME event.
00:12:45 Speaker 1
The price action is, however, almost perfectly explained by behavioral finance.
00:12:49 Speaker 1
Concepts like herd behavior, narrative economics, and prospect theory provide a more clear framework than the efficient market hypothesis.
00:12:59 Speaker 1
It kind of proves that why markets are efficient, they're not always efficient, and behavioral factors can overwhelm fundamentals very often.
00:13:09 Speaker 1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Daniel Verachtert and this is my market efficiency investigation.

All right. Uh so this is the first slide. This is the critical first step. Uh the statement that uh GameStop was trading at 4 cents in August of 2020 is incorrect. image to the left shows the market open. Uh it shows the market open, high, low, and close retrospectively for uh GameStop in the first four columns here. Uh looking at this image, we can see that the low for August never even dipped below a dollar. So the 4 cents obviously is not true. Uh GameStop closed at the end of August of 2020 at a price of $167. Uh moving on to my timeline. So the first uh big event was in August 2020 when GameStop was reaching near bankruptcy levels. So if we look at August right here, uh it has a low share value of less than $5 per share. And then in September of 2020, Ryan Cohen acquired 13% stake. the low share. It still had a low share value, but there was growth from August that we can see. And then it also grew into uh October. And uh then when we look at January of 2021 when the Reddit like Reddit broke the prices up to $483 per share, you can see a giant spike. uh this created a hurting bias because many people like saw this growth and heard about it behaviorally. Uh it caused serious growth in share value of about 11,000%. Uh and then when we look at February 2021, there were congressional hearings on market manipulation and you can see this large decrease in uh share value. Uh and then in the present values or in the present postevent stabilization uh the shares stabilized around $20 per share. So for my market efficiency testing this is my cap m uh I solved that it is -20.72% and then the actual return should have been or the actual return was 7,130%. Uh let me go back to this. So the negative 20% is because it moved in the opposite direction because the beta like the stock would tend uh to go to the opposite direction of the market. So for the abnormal returns uh the actual it's the actual return minus the expected return. So the 71.3 minus the negative 0.2072 2072 uh and that gives you 71.51. This shows that GameStop actually or GameStop's actual performance far exceeded what CAPM respected or predicted. Uh clear this shows clear signs of market inefficiencies and behavioral frenzies.

So more market efficiency testing uh the so the testing it's weak form which is prices already reflect past proc or processes semi- strong which is prices reflect all public information and strong form which is prices reflect all public and private information. So for weak form I check for patterns like momentum. So the prices keep rising or reversals where prices crash. Uh outcome for that is that it was violated. Uh GameStop had huge momentum up reversals down uh implying shortterm predictability. Uh for the semi- strong form. I looked at how quickly GameStop responded to public events such as Cohen stake, board seat, and Reddit hype. And based on that, the outcome was it was violated or strained. Uh prices overshot fundamental values for weeks, not just one day. And then strong form, uh it's not really testable without insider data. So the outcome is unknown and it's not testable. uh for investor profitability. Could a rational investor have profited systematically? Realistically, no. Even though some individuals made huge gains, those profits were not predictable, scalable, or repeatable. The results most likely came from luck, timing, and behavioral momentum, not rational analysis. In summary, in summary, there's a lack of X anti-anti expectations because it was strongly influenced by behavioral factors. From the Xanti point of view, it was very ris a very risky investment. From an expost view, people may wonder why everyone didn't buy it, but it didn't show clear future growth. So, it wasn't a safe investment. And even some of the people who did buy early and like before the massive surge lost major portions of their profit due to loss aversion bias because they didn't sell uh they didn't sell early enough because they were trying to maximize their profits and they missed peak. Uh the theoretical implications so EMH versus behavioral financing framework. Uh, EMH says that GameStop shouldn't have received a $7,000% return without new fundamental information. Additionally, behavioral finance explains that social influence and emotional trading drove the short sorry short-term mispricing. Uh, EMH still works in theory, but behavioral uh behavioral explains why reality can temporarily deviate. Uh, as for active versus passive management implications, though active managers couldn't systematically profit due to timing and liquidity, passive investors who stayed diversified weren't harmed. Uh, and then this proves that chasing short-term inefficiencies isn't sustainable and active trading can't reliably outperform in the long run. Uh as for market in or sorry market efficiency and policy implications uh from a policy view the game or the GameStop sorry from a policy view GameStop even exposed how clearly clearing and collateral systems can stress liquidity. Uh regulators should ensure transparency and risk management without limiting fair access to the market. Uh, and the goal isn't to stop volatility, but is to prevent structural breakdowns. Uh, that's all I have for my slides. And

here's my Python code that I have. It's just the actual or the expected actual and abnormal returns. And when you run it, it will give you the values that I have in my slides. So the expected return is -20.72%. The actual return is 7,130%. Abnormal return is 7,151%.

So that's all I have. Thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Meher and today we will
0:09
be going over the session 8 assignment
0:12
market efficiency investigation.
0:19
So we will use the driver method uh to
0:23
organize our thoughts. So define is the
0:28
first step of the driver framework and
0:32
first we have to assess the problem and
0:37
the problem is that um GameStop's
0:41
extreme price action.
0:44
So we have to assess the GameStop's
0:46
extreme price action during 2020 to 2021
0:50
against the three forms of the efficient
0:52
market hypothesis.
0:54
And the first critical step of this is
0:58
to verify the assignment claim which is
1:02
GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of
1:07
2020 against actual historical data.
1:11
So we have to determine if market
1:14
anomalies occurred and whether they
1:17
constitute evidence during market
1:19
efficiency against market efficiency.
1:24
So as we said we have to check if this
1:27
claim is correct. So uh we did some I
1:32
did some research and realized that the
1:35
claim of the GameStop uh GME traded at 4
1:40
cents in August 2020 is factually
1:43
incorrect.
1:44
And our evidence here is that um
1:48
according to Yahoo Finance, its prices
1:51
were significantly higher, generally
1:53
ranging from $11 to $1.40 per share
1:59
split adjusted during that month. And
2:02
this is important because the initial
2:04
validation step is uh proves the
2:08
necessity of verifying all given data
2:11
before analysis. And this next graph
2:14
that I'm going to show you in this
2:16
picture shows um the evidence given by
2:21
Yahoo Finance that it ranges from $11
2:27
to $1.40
2:30
of the month uh of August of 2020.
2:36
So the next step of the driver framework
2:39
is represent
2:41
and
2:43
um here
2:45
we uh so data acquisition where do we
2:47
get our data from? So we get uh the GME
2:51
price and volume data from 2020 to 2021
2:54
from Yahoo Finance and um there's a test
2:59
weak form test. So
3:03
we analyze historical price charts for
3:06
patterns. So can past momentum predict
3:09
returns. That is the question. And for
3:13
semi-strong test we see we map price
3:16
jumps to public news. So the Cohen
3:19
buying or Reddit posts 140% short
3:22
interest.
3:25
And then we look at behavioral analysis
3:27
and identify biases at play. the hurting
3:31
overconfidence and we analyze limits to
3:34
arbitrage.
3:43
So the next step uh of the driver
3:46
framework is to implement. So we used a
3:49
tool called Yahoo Finance as I said
3:52
before to download the official stock
3:54
data and then we use another another
3:57
tool Matt plot lib to draw the chart
4:02
that we planned. And
4:06
now we used I used
4:10
uh collab and gemini to help code
4:14
um
4:15
the findings.
4:18
And so here
4:20
uh we can also see and represent uh
4:24
before I move on to implement that uh
4:27
here are the formulas that we need.
4:28
expected return which is C cap cap capm
4:33
cost asset and price model and then
4:37
abnormal return and then car which is
4:41
cumulative abnormal return. So these are
4:44
the formulas for each of the respective
4:48
uh formulas that we need. And
4:54
now we can move to implement. And here
4:59
we see that this is the graph
5:03
uh for
5:05
the GME close price.
5:08
So, as we can see here,
5:11
the data shows a stable low price in
5:14
2020. As we can see in 2020, it's pretty
5:17
stable.
5:19
Um,
5:22
especially in August of 2020, which is
5:24
around this time, it's uh it's pretty
5:27
stable.
5:30
So this was followed by unprecedented
5:34
non-fundamental spike in January 2021.
5:38
So in January 2021, we can see that
5:40
there's a huge spike where
5:45
it increases by a lot as you can see on
5:48
this yellow line shown on the graph.
5:55
So validate is the next step of the
5:59
driver framework and this is the most
6:01
important step because we're trying to
6:04
read the chart here and see what the
6:06
chart tells us. So how a normal market
6:09
works when good bad news comes out the
6:12
price moves once to its new value and
6:15
then it settles. But what we saw was the
6:18
exact opposite. So finding one which is
6:22
hurting is that the price kept going up
6:26
just because it was already going up.
6:28
People on Reddit bought in a herd not
6:32
because not based on the company's value
6:36
but because of what they heard.
6:39
And then finding two is detach from
6:43
reality. The stock price hit $483,
6:48
but all experts agreed the real value of
6:50
the company was somewhere between $10 to
6:53
$40.
6:55
So in conclusion, the price was not
6:58
normal. It was completely disconnected
7:00
from the reality which proves that
7:02
market the market was not acting
7:05
efficiently.
7:07
So next step of the driver framework is
7:10
evolve. So our analysis was simple just
7:13
by looking at the chart.
7:16
Um we're
7:19
now we have to move on to the next step
7:21
and see how we can evolve and make it
7:23
more advanced.
7:25
The next step
7:28
is to um we can analyze social media. So
7:33
using a program to read all the Wall
7:37
Street bets Reddit posts and me measure
7:41
um the hype level each day to see how it
7:44
matches the stock price. So using social
7:47
media is one step and then another step
7:49
that we can take to analyze it further
7:52
is we can use formulas like I mentioned
7:56
CAPM to calculate exactly how abnormal
8:00
the stock's return was compared to the
8:02
rest of the market.
8:06
So the last step of the framework is
8:10
reflect. So the main lesson that we got
8:14
from this is markets are run by people
8:16
and people aren't always rational.
8:19
So
8:21
the key idea is uh so there's a famous
8:24
saying that says the market can remain
8:27
irrational longer than you can remain
8:29
solvent. What this means is that even
8:32
though the price, the high price was
8:34
wrong, the professional investors who
8:36
bet against it lost billions and they
8:39
were right, but they went broke waiting
8:41
for everyone else to realize it. And
8:45
um the GameStop event is a perfect
8:47
example of how human behavior like
8:49
hurting and hype can sometimes be more
8:54
powerful than financial theory.
8:57
Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Okay, so for this assignment, we are going to investigate the GME short squeeze from 2020 to 2021. So for our defined discover, our primary objective is to investigate the GME short squeeze from 2020 to 2021 to test the validity of efficient market hypothesis and evaluate the role of behavioral finance in explaining the observed price behavior. Our key question is which form of market efficiency was violated and could a rational investor have systematically profited after adjusting for risk? And our information, we have GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2022, which actually is false. According to Google Finance, GameStop traded at $1.04 in August 2022 up to $1.67 by the end of August. And this is using split adjusted data from a split app in the future. So realistically, it'd be higher, but we're using this for the rest of the assignment. So my represent stage, we are going to investigate the GME stock. We'll use CAPM to calculate the daily abnormal returns.

The estimation window will be used to run an estimate on GME's risk against the S&P 500, then calculate the average returns and find the cumulative abnormal returns, which will be the main evidence of the market inefficiency. We will then analyze the behavioral factors to find the persistent mispricing in the context of limits to arbitrage and hurting behavior arbitrage. So, for daily return, it's going to measure the stock price change from one day to the next with percentage gains or losses using return on day, price at the end of day T, and price at the end of the previous day. We have CAPM expected returns to estimate what return a stock should have been based on risk, and that will be using expected return, risk-free rate, sensitivity to market, and market return. Then we have Abnormal Return, which will show actual daily returns differing from the expected, which uses actual daily return and expected daily return from the Kappa model to get that.

Then we are also using Cumulative Abnormal Return, which adds up abnormal returns across event windows, and we will be using Abnormal Return on each day, and then Start and End of the event window will also be used. So to implement this, I made a code using Gemini. I implemented it into Colab to find the beta estimation, the car calculation, and then a t-test for statistical significance. So right here I have it. So the first part where it's going to load tools such as Y-Finance in order to get the stock data. It uses Pandas for handling data and NumPy for math and stats models to run the CAPM regression. And then it defines the time frames estimation window, which is where the model learns the GME's normal behavior, which is also the period for testing. And then it will download GME's price history and the S&P 500's market index for the time period. And then it will convert daily prices into percentage returns and give us the data that we need.

So, when we run this, it gives us our beta estimation, our AR and CAR calculations, and our validation. So, from this, we get a beta estimation of 1.6024, which indicates that GME was already 1.6 times more volatile than the overall stock market before the main shortage squeeze event. And this is a key risk factor. And then we have the CAR value of 347.78%, which means during the two-month period, GME's price increased 347.78%, more than what we expected. This shows its severe market anomaly. We then have a t-stat of 7.51, meaning the car is many standard deviations away from zero. From this we can conclude that the car is overwhelmingly significant and cannot be justified by conventional CAPM risk factors. So, to validate this, like I said, we're going to use the t-stat of 7.51, which is extremely high, which means the car is statistically significant, and then the rest of the calculations are correct based on the equations listed in the represent stage.

And then we can move on to evolve. so the car three hundred forty seven point seventy eight proofs any strong form the image violation the market failed to rationally process public information surrounding the extreme short an activist investment this was sustained by the hero finance factors mostly coordinated and hurting mostly coordinated hurting by retail traders which exploited the limits to arbitrage this demonstrates that systematic risk adjusted profitability was not available for those who try to restore efficiency so basically that the uh... The numbers that were presented are way off from what was expected and none of these models could really predict it because it is such a gap. Something else would be hurting by retail traders completely exploited this and completely passed the models that we were given.

So then with the for the reflects we could use this message methods for other Like strange patterns in the market just to see if they could have been predicted or even like try to predict them But it's also the main idea is kind of that You can't predict the market all the time and there are some calculations some things that the calculations won't show Like your cap and pricing and stuff like that will not be able to show it and that's like the market can be extremely affected by hurting behavior and it can overwhelm conventional trading so basically like people can just there there are factors that can completely change the market that can overwhelm like the usual conventional trading strategies and just conventional estimations and value and stuff like that so this whole thing really just shows that based on the prices of the stock throughout that it kind of shows that none of our models could predict it And it was kind of just caused by hurting my retail investors.

And it's really just kind of a bit of an anomaly in the stock market. So yeah, that's all.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, this is Tang and this is my session
8 assignment and in this assignment we
will investigated market efficiency
using the GameStop short squid event of
2020 to 2021 as a case study and in this
case we will verify the accuracy of
stated facts analyze price behavior rel
to efficient market hypothesis
predictions and eval evaluate whether
market anomaly
uh constitute evidence against the
market efficiency or can be explained
within the exist existing framework. So
the first critical step is that we need
to verify the statement gametop traded
at 0.04
in August 2020 against the actual
history data. If incorrect document the
accurate figures and determine
appropriate communication approach for
corre correcting the professor. So here
are some K timeline August 2020,
September 2020, January 2021, February
2021 and present
and also we have some key data points
and here are the required analysis.
These are all documented in the collab
and now let's started with the stage one
define and discover. So what is the
problem? What we need to analyze this?
So we want to understand if markets are
really efficient. So an efficient market
means prices already reflect all
available information. So no one can
systematically
beat the market. So now GameStop GME
became famous in early 2021 when small
retail investors on Reddit drove its
price from under 20 to over $480 in just
a days. So many people claim this should
markets are in rational.
So in this uh assignment we will test
whether this event quality is the
efficient market hypothesis. So here are
some key research questions. So was the
statement uh GME traded at 0.04 04 in
August 2020 is correct. And how did
GME's price respond to K public news?
And did price adjust quickly and
rationally or did they overreact?
The fourth question that could rational
investors have made systemat have made
systematic profit.
Here is the bas what is em basics as I
will make you better understand in plain
English. E image has three form uh three
forms which are weak form, semi strong
and strong form
and data we will use is Yahoo FMS and
the timeline is August 2020 to present
and K events we have mentioned in this
previous uh previous uh sale and for the
hypothesis we want to present either the
prices in August to 2020 already
reflected knowing fundamentals and five
specs in January 2021 caused by social
media attention. This is a begiver of uh
uh action and the third one is abnormal
returns and run event. So this is
possible semi strong from val valuation.
So let's uh represent our uh our steps.
The first one is verify data accuracy.
Second step is collect and clean data.
The third one is to mark event dates.
The fourth and five is like about build
a model to
learn about model normal returns and
compute abnormal returns and six and
seven to analyze and interpret our
results and make some reflections and
conclusions. So we will use pattern for
data handling. Here is the charts
we used.
for the some specific dates we can use
the data
and also we will analyze
Yahoo Finance to verify whether the GME
traded between traded at 0.04.
So from from that we can see that after
verifying the Yahoo Finance data GME
traded really between like 1.04
to 1.79.
So closing at uh 1.67 on August 30th. So
this is equals to roughly 6 to7
pre-split. So meaning that the statement
that GM traded at 0.04 is inaccurate.
So this is the number is completely
wrong. And the fourth step we need to
define the key event and make the quick
charts for our analysis. We now answer
the question one that
the statements is incorrect. So how did
Jy's price um respond to that
and now we will make the use Python to
analyze the data and here are some
specific steps. First is rename columns
join gy data flatten column index and
make sure adjusted close columns exist.
This is all about present data. So I
will
scroll down quickly.
Yes. So the most important part is about
the result and the charts. So from the
charts we can see that
before September like 2020
the GMA traded at only about1 to2
I think
yeah
so very low because the firm was
struggling financially and after the
stake event the price begin to trend
upward showing that the market quickly
incorporate new positive
information. So we can see that after
the artistic event.
Yes, it's about 2020 September.
Yeah.
So the huge spike in January 2020 is
abnormal like prices jumped far beyond
any change in fundamentals.
Yeah.
And this is where the behavioral factors
like the social media have and her
behavior and formal dominated the
rational valuation. And after February
2021,
the price gradually declined as steep
stabilized. So showing that the press
eventually converted and toward more
reasonable levels once like excitement
faded. So this is about like how the uh
audience reacted to the social media
and now we will make the market model
and abnormal return analysis. So this
section will test whether GM prices
change around each event
and they are larger than would expect
from normal market movement.
This is all code we need to use.
Let's scroll down
also we will run for each event like the
t test. So that that will have have
better to interpret this and here is a
summary.
So the st from that we can test that the
our chart this is also what the chart
suggested the gim stop event was not a
failure of all market in fishing but a
temporary behavior of anomaly via social
trading and structural limit overpowered
rational press discovery and we I will
explain that in the
in the next stage validate
like when you look at the P value
we can see that RC
board pig the econ
they are not very significant like to
the whole model I think so about this
economic size of abnormal returns were
large like especially during the January
2021 short squeeze P values above like
0.05 05 indic that all these event were
not stat statically significant when
tested against like random daily
variation. So this means that the
market's volatility was too extreme to
confirm the consistent principle of
normal returns and this funing suggest a
temporary inefficient not a structural
breakdown of image. So we can see that
it's it's not like a very normal uh
situation or is this very rare for the
market.
So for that we can interpret pre
for the each event we can see that for
the September 2020 stake the market
adjusted normally but for the January
2021 broad news this is a overreaction
but for the January 27th to 28th
restriction we can see that the panics
and it reflects the panic and limits to
uh arbitrage.
So we can see that the practice reacted
far more than fundamentally justified.
So we can see that information not
processed inflationally which means not
not all the investor in the market will
get to know this information earlier and
the her behavior and social media
attention causes temporary like missing
pricing.
So still for so still no clear evidence
anyone could systematically profit once
trading limits risk and timing to
consider.
So now let's go to the evolve stage. So
the goal is to apply what we learn to
understand how investors and analysis
and regulators can evolve in response
such like market anomalies. So for the
for the investors so we don't confuse
popularity with value like high trading
volume volume or like Chinese stocks
don't guarantee subst subst
sub substant of gains and the dy dy
exposure like the behavioral shocks are
unpredictable like passive index
investing often outperform emotional
timing. So I think that this for if for
now like if we want to use baseline like
analysis this time we are this is not
work. So we will also for the investors
we will be aware of like liquidity risk.
There will trading platform restrict
activity
even profitable position can be like
executed
and also for the regulators like ensure
fair market access trading restrictions.
disproportionately affected retail
traders but I think like as we if we
want to reinvest there's not all we can
guarantee that so improve transparency
that's very normal for I think it's for
all industry like also we they need to
monitor like the social mediadriven
volatility like price for like Reddit
and Twitter X and other platforms like
for I don't know like for ins or
Facebook also like YouTube if you want
to like upload some videos or for some
like influencers they upload some video
they can amplify the price distortions
faster than the traditional media since
like the development of nowadays social
media like also for us we we need to
integrate behavioral finance into
valuation models like MH alone cannot
explain rapid uh crowd driven.
So for now for the reflection part as a
beginner for the for nouns analysis we I
learned that market aren't perfectly
efficient like humans and technology
both affects prices and now I think this
is more about like behavioral economies
or be finance they can this this topics
or this kind of license can explain real
worlds better than serial loan
and image is a baseline over long
periods it's mostly hold but sheltering
emotions break it also data ver
verification methods like small errors
can ruin an argument.
So critically some takeaways that
for the ital form a weak form not
clearly violated a semi strong form
that's validated short-term reaction to
the news and the strong form no proof
anyone used inside info to win
consisting so now I think that if still
we need to have the transparency and
better education a cap of an investor to
avoid panic and also we we know that the
whole case or whole like the market we
cannot it's not easy to predict.
So that's all for my session 8
assignment. Thank you for watching.

",FALSE,1,"Hello, this is my session 8 assignment for Management 310, so I'm going to go ahead and start with the driver method, and the first thing is to find and discover. So just to give a quick overview of the actual problem, so the primary goal is to investigate the market efficiency using GameStop, GM8, GME, short squeeze event that have transferred from 2020 to 2021 as a case study. The analysis must determine which form of the Fish and Market Hypothesis, EMH, if any, was violated, and whether the observed price behavior can be explained by traditional frameworks or requires behavioral finance concepts.

And during this stage, it focuses on clearly understanding the problem, verifying the initial facts, and defining the main goal and scope of the analysis. So our goal is to produce a rigorous data-driven analysis that assesses the GME event's implications for the EMH and provides a balanced comparison between the efficient market hypothesis predictions and behavioral finance explanations.

So just a quick fact verification as our first step. So the initial claim is that GME traded at $0.04 in August of 2020, and it must be verified against actual historical data. This is a critical prerequisite before proceeding with any analysis. Our hypothesis is that the stated price of $0.04 is likely incorrect given the stock had a price of around $4 to $6 in August 2020. Our action is to find the actual closing price for GME in August of 2020 and our communication plan, if incorrect, the accurate figures and a professional correction approach must be documented. So, some of the key questions to answer is, was the price of 4 cents in August 2020 accurate? If not, what was the correct price? And then, from which market efficiency, weak, semi-strong, or strong, was violated by the GME event? Could rational investors have systematically profited from this event, and what does this imply about the predictability of returns? Next, how did behavioral finance biases, like hurting or anchoring, explain the observed price anomalies? And let's see what theoretical and policy implications for active versus passive management and market regulation.

So moving on to the represent part, which is the plan. So this stage outlines the analytical and technical steps required to address the key questions and achieve the assessment goals. The core formula and methodology for this is the analysis will be centered on the advanced study methodology to test for abnormal returns, which is crucial for evaluating market efficiency. The abnormal return formula is this. Abnormal return equals the actual return minus expected return. The capital asset pricing model, CAPM, will be used to estimate the expected return. The expected return using the CAPM model is as follows, risk-free rate plus beta times the market return minus the risk-free rate.

Now for our analytical process. The process will be conducted in a sequential data-driven manner. Step 1 to get the data, so data acquisition and verification. Acquire historical daily stock price and volume data for GME. and relevant market index. For example, the S&P 500. Step two, weak form efficiency test, which is the price patterns. So to analyze the GME price movement before this, we should identify any exploitable and non-random patterns. In addition, to calculate abnormal returns, which are ARs and cumulative abnormal returns cars and around the key event dates. For example, Ryan Cohen's investment announcement January 2021 where there was a surge and using the CAPM framework. And text for statistical significance around the ARs in cars and the existence of statistically significant ARs suggestion of violation of a weak form efficiency.

Step three is to form a semi-strong form efficiency test, which is the public information, to compare the speed of the price adjustment to major public news against the event timeline. The massive price surge, despite fundamental analysis estimates of $10 to $40 per share, suggests a market reaction beyond the public fundamental value, potentially violating semi-strong form efficiency.

Step four, the strong form efficiency test, which is the provider and insider information. So, analyze the data points show interest peaked at 140% of flow and resulting hedge fund losses. For example, Melvin Capital sustained a a 53% loss. Evaluate whether insiders-regulators could have profited systematically based on the non-public knowledge of extreme short-selling position, though this is difficult to prove empirically. Step five, the behavior finance analysis. Identify and analyze the specific behavior biases, hurting behavior, the Wall Street Bats influence, social media influence, and the loss aversion. amongst the short sellers and forced to cover. Discuss the limits to arbitrage. Why the price disconnect from fundamentals persisted.

In step six, the rational profitability and theoretical implications. So I'm going to evaluate the high-risk and non-systematic nature of the profit opportunities to assess if they were a truly systematic or rational investor focusing on x-ante versus x-post analysis. Synthesize the findings to compare the EMS framework with the behavioral finance explanation. And then the technical requirements for this, we're going to use Python as the platform aka Google Call Lab for analysis and their visualization, not aka Google CoalLab, but that's what we're going to put our code into, Google CoalLab. And then our deliverables are an exebutable code for all calculations and clear visualizations of abnormal returns in the event timeline.

So the next step is to acquire the GME historical price data and verify the 4 cent claim from August 2020. So use the tools available to search for the historical stock price of GameSock GME in August 2020 to verify the game.

Our third step is to implement the analysis and the code. So our goal here is to execute the code, the core events, study, calculations, and build empirical analysis required to test the efficient market hypothesis. And our action we're going to be taking is to build an integrated model using Python to perform data acquisition, data estimation, and abnormal return calculations and visualizations of the results. So the critical first step to do is a fact, verification, and correction. The initial claim is that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is that it's incorrect. Our correction is the actual split-off adjusted closing price for GME in August 2020 was a range approximately of $1.04 to $1.67. And our methodology is all subsequent calculations will use accurate historical price data.

So now I'm going to go ahead and go to our co-lab before we continue. So I sent our first three steps into Gemini, and Gemini went ahead and gave me some code and also a market efficiency analysis of GameStop. So here we have the code Gemini had sent. So the first part of this code is to define the stock that we want, to create the variable to hold the stock's ticker symbol, so the ticker symbol for our stock will be GME. We'll also implement YFinanceLibrary as well. Part 2 is our critical first step. we need to check the price in august of 2020 and what our claim was and checking and a cute in a clear and human readable way and a clear conclusion as well then part three to verify other clear event data as well peak price from the event timeline And then for the code's analysis, fetching data for GME, as we defined before as the game stock price. So analysis for August 2020, the lowest price GME traded at in August 2020 is $1. Conclusion is that the statement that GME traded up for cents is incorrect, the actual low is around $1. In the analysis for the 2021 squeeze, the highest pace that GMU traded at during the January-February 2021 squeeze was $120.75. This peak occurred on 2021-1-28, January 28, 2021. And in conclusion, the statement, the price surge to $483 is accurate.

Google Call Lab also gave required analysis for it. And the forms of market efficiency as well as an evaluation and comparison and assessment. But we're going to go over that.

So here we also have the financial analysis and calculations. The analysis uses the capital asset pricing model, Kappa M, to calculate the market adjusted abnormal return for the event window. So the Kappa M formula is abnormal return, which equals the GME actual return, minus the risk-free return, plus GME risk level, times the market risk reward. Our data inputs are the estimation period, market proxy, which is where we're going to use the S&P 500, and the risk-free rate as well. which is an assumed average of 0.1% over the period, as well as the beta estimation. The beta is estimated from the pre-event estimation period to represent GMAE's systematic risk and the normal market returns. So here we have that same formula that Collab used. so i just created some tables to make this more more visually makes sense so the metric the value which is the hypothetical result and the interpretation so the gme the beta 1.7 so gme was at was 70 percent more volatile than the market even before the squeeze this is just at high business risk typically of troubled small-cap retailer to our abnormal return calculation

the code calculates the expected return and the abnormal return for the peak event window of january 11th 2001 to february 1st 2001 so we have the same formula that we used before. So we have January 13th, 2021, with GMU return, expected return, and abnormal return as well calculated. January 27th, 2021, we have the same. And February 1st, which is the post-restrictions. Here we see a very high decrease in all of these percentages. Now, cumulative abnormal return, we don't have one for these, but for the actual abnormal return, we have a cumulative of 300%.

Now, just an analytical interpretation of all of these equations and all of these findings. So, weak form, the car of over 300% is statistically significant. This huge return was driven by the price momentum and past trading volume, indicating that the past price information was not efficiently reflected. And the violation, violated.

The price surged to $483 while fundamental analysis public information suggests a value of only $10-$40. The massive divergence shows that the market ignored public fundamental news.

The trading restrictions implemented by Robinhood at the peak created information asymmetry an advantage for those who could still trade, potentially allowing for some uninformed parties to profit in a way that suggests a breakdown of fair access to information. So this one's just likely violated.

Now for behavioral finance analysis. The failure of EMH requires an explanation from the behavioral finance. The first explanation is trading and social media influence. The massive increase in retail trading volume directly corresponds to the positive abnormal returns, indicating that the returns were not based on fundamentals but on coordinated collective action driven by social media. Limits to Arborage The cumulative abnormal return persisted for weeks because the short seller's losses created an asset substitution problem, forcing them to take excessive risks, while rational arbitrators could not correct the price because the capital required was too high due to noise trader risk.

In addition, we have rational investor profitability analysis. So, before the fact, a rational investor was purely based on fundamentals and would have shorted the stock. However, due to the unqualified risk of the short squeeze, systematic profit was not available. The required margin and volatility made it an irrational bet for a systematic investor. So, after the fact, while some individuals profited immensely, the opportunity was non-systematic and high risk. It was a successful speculative bet on an anonymity, not a failure of the EMH, in the sense that an average systematic investor could easily and repeatedly profit.

Now, after all our code and all our analysis, we can move on to the validate portion. This stage checks the analysis for accurate and logical consistency. For statistical validation, so after calculating the abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return, to perform a t-test to confirm that the observed abnormal return is statistically significant. If the p-value is below the significance level, then the reserves are robust and support the conclusion that abnormal returns occurred.

For a logical check as well, the observed phenomenon is an asset substitution problem and a limit to arbitrary issues. Asset substitution, so essentially short sellers were facing huge losses and had incentive to take on more risk. Limits? Rational institution investors knew that GME was overvalued but couldn't exploit the inefficiency because of the high cost and risk of taking a short position due to the high possibility of a short squeeze. This validates why the price anomaly persisted.

In addition, a benchmarking compared to the calculated abnormal returns to similar historical short squeeze to ensure the magnitude of the results is plausible for such an extreme of market event.

Next, evolve. The stage critiques, the analysis, and to just how it could be improved by using alternative models or broader perspectives. So the CAPN limitation critique. So the event relies on the CAPN as single factor model. CAPN assumes that beta is the only risk that matters. So, in order to evolve this and try to get better for next time, to use a multi-factor model like the Framer-French 3 model with a five-factor model to calculate the expected returns more robustly, GME, being a small-cap value stock at the time, is highly susceptible to these other risk factors, making a multi-factor model superior for empirical accuracy.

Another is modeling behavioral biases. The analysis should move beyond merely identifying biases to potentially modeling them. Evolution. Incorporated a variable for social medias into the abnormal routine calculation to directly quantify the influence of hurting behavior on the price changes. And lastly, the policy implications that then expose a market microstructure's issues. In order to evolve from this, to discuss the role of payment for order flow and the collateral requirement for brokerage cleaning houses, which reject direct cause of the trading restrictions imposed by Robinhood. This moves the analysis from purely academic to a practical policy discussion.

There are some reflections and key takeaways that I took away. This is also the final stage that synthesizes the findings into core lessons learned. The first key takeaway was that the efficient market hypothesis is plausible in extremes. The DME event provides strong evidence against strict forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The violation of a semi-strong efficiency was the most pronounced. as the price became completely disconnected from all publicly available fundamental information.

My second key takeaway was that the limits to arbitrage is real. The short squeeze demonstrated that even when stock is clearly mispriced, irrational professional investors may be unable to correct it due to limits of arbitrage, namely the risk of margin calls and capital constraints.

Furthermore, the last few takeaways that I took was the power of social coordination. The event highlighted a new reality that retail investors, when coordinate, can act as a massive force, creating behavioral anomalies in systematic scale, thus redefining the market risk in an age of social media.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Clara Weinzapfel and
today I'm going to be going over the
session 8 assignment. I started in the
textbook reading over the entire
assignment. The assignment is to
investigate market efficiency using the
GameStop short squeeze event of 2020
through 2021 as a case study. Our job is
to verify the accuracy of stated facts
such as that it traded at 4 cents in
August 2020.
analyze price behavior relative to
efficient market hypothesis predictions
and evaluate whether market anomalies
constitute evidence against market
efficiency or can be explained within
existing frameworks. So I started by
copying and pasting the session
assignment into Google Gemini. I asked
it to create a Python code that follows
the driver formula and uses the kiss
principle ensuring that all aspects of
the project are met and all questions
answered. So it then gave me a Python
code that I was able to copy and paste
here into Google Collab and then run the
code
over this analysis uses Python code to
study the GameStop or GME short squeeze
event specifically checking if the
market was efficient or irrational. The
entire study is structured using the
driver framework to make sure we cover
every step from checking facts to
running the numbers and drawing
conclusions. So starting off in the
driver stage define and discover
here
this is where we set up the study and do
the required factchecking. So here at
number one is a fact check. The code
immediately corrects a mistake which is
the claim that GME traded at 4 cents in
August 2020
saying that it is false. The actual
price range was much higher around 1.04
or $14
to $167.
This is the first critical step of the
assignment recognizing this mistake and
defining the correct numbers.
Moving down slightly to
the
ticker definitions, the code defines the
assets GME ticker is GME and the market
benchmark market ticker is the S SNP 500
index.
Moving down to time windows,
two crucial time periods are set. So
first here in these first two lines we
have the estimation estimation window
October 1st to December 31st 2020 is
used to see how GME normally behaved
before the event. And then the second
part is the event window January 15th to
February 15th 2021 covers the actual
short squeeze. And then when we go down
to the bottom of the code, we can see
this outlined here under driver stage
one. It does the critical fact check and
gives us the correct numbers for that.
This section documents the plan and gets
the necessary data.
So the analytical plan
is where it starts. As you can see right
here, the script states the plan. Use an
event study based on the CAPM
to compare GME to the market.
And then second is robust data download.
The code first tries to download live
adjusted closing prices using Y finance
and then after that is the data
fallback. So because external network
connections can fail, which was
happening when I went to run the code, a
safety feature is included. If the live
data download doesn't work, the script
automatically switches to hard-coded
historical data. This ensures the
calculation part of the assignment
always runs successfully. So here you
can see the
data inputed into the code.
And following that is the return
calculation.
So after getting the prices, the script
calculates the daily log returns, which
is the standard way financial analysts
measure daily percentage change for both
GME and the S&P 500.
And then lastly, stop check. A final
check ensures the data exists before
moving on. If not, the script prints a
fatal error error and stops cleanly. So
all of this code is going through
um trying to get data online and then if
that doesn't work going to the hardcoded
data.
So the next stage is driver stage three
which is implement. This is the main
calculation stage where the market
efficiency test is run. So in this first
section is the capm estimation using the
estimation window. The code uses the
returns from the estimation window to
run a regression. This calculates GME's
normal relationship to the market,
giving us two key numbers, which you can
see are down here, alpha and beta. So
alpha is how much GME returned beyond
what the market did. Expect it to be
zero in an efficient market. And then
beta is how sensitive GME's returns are
to market movements, which is systematic
risk.
and then it goes to the expected
returns.
The calculated alpha and beta are then
applied to the market's returns during
the event window to find out what GME's
return should have been which is the
expected return.
And then so it says that it's running
the ordinary le squares regression
following that
is calculating abnormal returns for the
event window. So the script finds the
daily abnormal return by taking GME's
actual return and subtracting its
expected return. This shows the daily
impact of the short squeeze.
So here we have the expected the
abnormal which we said was actual minus
expected return. And then this shows
that the calculated expected return is
alpha plus beta times this R market
value.
And then lastly we have calculate
cumulative abnormal return. This C value
which is very high over 200% is the key
piece of evidence showing the severity
of the market event.
So we scroll down into this section
in the output
and we can see in driver stage three we
have the
alpha the beta 033
the beta as 1.5618
then it goes on to the event study
results which is the abnormal returns
during short squeeze the total Total
event days is 20 and cumulative abnormal
return is.1555
or 15.55%.
And then it gives us a note saying that
a positive C suggests GME significantly
outperformed its expected return which
indicates a major market anomaly and a
violation of semi- strong EMH.
Stage four of driver is validate which
is the interpretation of results. So
this code is telling us what the numbers
mean. For validation, the incredibly
large positive C is the main validation
point. A value this high confirms that
GME's price movement was not based on
fundamentals or normal risk. And then
secondly, semi- strong EMH conclusion is
that this massive C immediately proves a
clear violation of the semi- strong form
of the EMH, meaning the stock price did
not reflect publicly available
information like financial reports or
company news.
And we can also see
this information in the output here when
it tells us that R is extremely large
and reiterates the information that I
just said.
St. Final two stages of driver five and
six which are evolve and reflect. These
final stages address the qualitative
questions about market behavior and
theory. So first here we have the market
efficiency analysis. The script
concludes that the event violated all
three forms of the EMH.
Here it says that the weak form is
violated. So trading patterns were
successfully exploited. The next the
semi- strong form is also violated.
Price did not reflect public information
which is confirmed by the C. And the
next the strong form is violated.
Insiders like hedge funds so lost huge
amounts showing private information
offered no protection. And then next the
behavioral finance analysis. The event
was fueled by irrational behavior. So
first we have hurting coordinated buying
on social media drove prices and then
next is limits to arbitrage
which rational traders couldn't easily
stop the rally because of high borrowing
costs for shorting the stock. Next is
overconfidence.
The yellow mentality drove
and mentally took over pushing risk
tolerance to extreme levels. So next we
have
rational investor profitability. The
script confirms
that no systematic reliable profit
opportunity existed based on fundamental
analysis. profit was purely speculative
and risky. And then last is
theoretical implications. The GME event
shows that while EMH might hold true
long-term, short-term coordinated
irrationality and trading difficulties
can cause massive real world market
anomalies.
And this is also outlined again in these
last sections when we run the code.
It has numbers 1 through 4. The EMH
violation classification, behavioral
finance analysis, rational investor
profitability, and theoretical
implications.
In conclusion, the comprehensive event
study confirmed the initial GME of 4
cents price claim was false. The actual
price was $14 through $167.
The core quantitative result, an
extremely large cumulative abnormal
return, empirically proves a clear
violation of the semi- strong form of
the EMH as the price entirely ignored
public fundamental value. This failure
was fueled by behavioral finance hurting
and overconfidence and structural issues
like limits to arbitrage concluding that
system systemic systematic rational
profit opportunities did not exist. X
ente and all three forms of the EMH were
violated by the event.",,0,1

Hi, I'm Johanna Nguyen from your Management 310 class from 430 to 520. I didn't fully understand this assignment. I learned a lot about GameStop, but still a little... I didn't really understand where I should go, but I think I have... I did some good work. Um, yeah, so my job was to investigate market efficiency using GameStop, the short squeeze event of 2020-2021 as a case study, verify stated facts like this and against real data and if correct, what I would do correcting the professor. So first to verify this, it's very much wrong checking Finance Yahoo. We know that the open was 1.0,
01:07
a high of 1.79, a low of 1.0. We had these close and adjusting close and a volume. So nowhere, none of that information was anywhere close of.04. So it could have been a typo, could have been a missing. And always when you're correcting someone, especially a professor, you don't want to be rude.
01:30
So, you know, in class, I would probably raise my hand and say, hey, you know, I looked at this thing. Maybe I, like, misunderstood what you're trying to communicate to me. But, you know, is this correct? And then I would send an email and such. So, yeah, so we're going to go down these. I also verified this because I was a little confused, but also it was a good learning moment to verify all of this.
01:58
So in August 2020, GameStop was near bankruptcy levels, and this was true. Here's another source. September 2020, Ryan Cohen and Shui, founder, acquired 13% of the stake. January 2021, Wall Street's bed surged to a whole bunch. And I actually remember this happening. I was a freshman in high school.
02:30
February 2021, there were congressional hearings on market manipulation. And in my head, I was like, why is there a hearing? So it was because, you know, unprecedented volatility and market disruption raised some concerns about, you know about the market structure, but most importantly, fairness and potential manipulation.
02:51
Because if people do that all the time, it might mess up the economy big time and might hurt people with jobs, people, you know, all that stuff. It will cause a lot of variance with inflation and all, mess up a lot of things. Predictions will be out the wahoo. Determined, this, because there was a hearing, it determined a role of Robinhood, trading restrictions, if there was market manipulation, which was how to restrict it, and investor protections. Um, and this is a very unique title, but this is the case. Um,
03:35
so yeah, uh, I think down here I have Robinhood. Yeah, Robinhood, uh, was an app that allowed you to trade stuff, but it stopped allowing you to buy GameStop and only allowed you to sell, and that hurt GameStop a lot. It was the gamification, like making it like a game, and kind of hurt GameStop a lot.
04:04
making it like a game, and kind of hurt GameStop a lot. So post the event, in conclusion, the most significant action was a proposal to increase transparency around short-selling activities, like, again, what Robinhood was doing.
04:26
The House Committee eventually released a report confirming that significant legislative and regulatory reforms were needed to modernize the systems, especially after super brokers like, you know, Robinhood again. And also while payment for order flow was that, so it's where brokers, seller customers, you know, trade orders to market makers. It wasn't banned, but it definitely became more regulated. It became a debate and it's been some time now.
04:50
Congress also discovered, discussed the design of trading apps being excessive or risky and ultimately led to closure of hedge funds, most notably Melvin Capital, which suffered huge losses. So this also checked off these. And yeah, so here's for the required analysis about what this was. Again, I was a little confused, so bear with me.
05:23
Yeah, so we're going to verify all historical price data and document corrections. I didn't know what I was supposed to verify, too. So I'm assuming, like, predicted style. It's my job to predict. So I have a couple things. This one being down here. It gave me the high, it gave me this also gave me that besides just looking at it, gave me the high and close of, you know, checking to see if it was, if, you know, this was 0.04. Obviously it was not, but check that with coding as well.
06:10
We go all the way down here. This was based off of, if you recognize this code, it's because it was from the textbook. You know, just in case I implemented the own stock beta from like using what I found online. And it gave me these numbers. So we got our pre-earnings of 0.1, announcement day of normal of 5.0.
06:41
And we can, we're about to crosscheck this with a more accurate data clicker. This took me a while because it kept giving me errors and couldn't really explain it to me, but I eventually figured it out. And it gives us this. This is, you know, funny thing is called abnormal because it was abnormal to me. I didn't know anything about it, but I'm going to try to explain it.
07:11
So, hold on. Yeah. So, test market efficiency. I'm going to quickly go over this before I end up yapping about my code. about my code, well, Gemini's code. It was made by Eugene Fama to see how information public, private, you know, that our company is reflected in market prices states that prices always reflect all past and historical information.
07:40
Semi-strong stocks from Lake Forum believes that stock price reflects all public information, and strong is current stock price reflects all public and private information. So, that's very interesting. So, we're going to go to Gemini. And we're just like, hey, what's all this? What's all this? So we're going to go up here.
08:14
So AR, abnormal return, defined as this. It's basically measuring the actual and not. So zero, you want it to be closest to to zero uh you're you're measuring you know if it goes up or down um and post announcement this being the announcement a couple days being two goes down and then for a whole bunch of days it goes positive and so that um uh x is out here let's let's go in here um so when testing for semi strong if it's basically the same like slope for a good period of time it's's violated. And so that's why we have some right here, because of the
09:07
post-announcement drift. And then from what it told me about strong form, it is illegal and it is violated, but it's not viable for this strategy. And for weak form, it's not possible. Profiting required understanding of structural flow not just patterns.
09:36
And then we also got whether weak would be violated so I asked chatgbt instead of Gemini of what testing for week. So we went with a norm.distribute, a normal distribution. So I put in all 2019, 2020, and 2021 computed returns in adjunct close. So I got my prediction. And then I found with the p-value being super, super low, below 0.
10:08
05, it's inefficient, and because it's inefficient, we can guarantee that it is violated. So, already, it's pretty high, it's not looking too great. Um... Check, check... How about this... Jim and I helped me a lot. Um... So I did... I know I was yapping all over the place. But... Yeah. GameStop. Awesome. Yeah, we can conclude that, you know, all of these were violated.
11:10
Okay, thank you. I think that is all that I have for right now. But thank you so much.",,0,1

so, uh ver first, you know, verifying,
0:21
you know, your first statements. Uh
0:23
GameStop traded at 04 in August 2020.
0:26
That is unbelievably incorrect. Um
0:30
checking finance.yahoo
0:32
uh you can see that uh its highest was
0:36
uh 1.79 and its lowest was 1.0 and
0:42
nowhere nowhere near close for trading
0:44
at 0.04. Um
0:48
and you can also find other trading
0:50
prices for other dates. And you know if
0:53
I were if you had any other issues or
0:56
incorrect statements I you know again I
0:59
would email you or talk to you in class
1:02
or after class. Um yeah, so looking at
1:07
uh to also verify some of the timeline
1:10
uh again August 2020 uh GameStop was
1:14
near bankruptcy levels and then in
1:17
September uh Ryan uh Cohen uh acquired
1:20
13% which did um influence uh because
1:24
this was a part of this was such a huge
1:27
amount of uh GameStop shares um having
1:31
like this event was a part of the public
1:34
information that a lot of people had and
1:37
and maybe in influenced people to also
1:40
put in more money into GameStop. And in
1:44
January 2021,
1:47
uh uh Reddit uh uh Wall Street Bets also
1:51
contributed a lot to um GameStop making
1:55
the stock go uh up a lot. Um, in
1:59
February 2021, uh, there were
2:02
confession, uh, congressional hearings
2:04
about market manipulation. Uh, so, uh,
2:08
like I spoke in my first video, um, you
2:11
know, I was a little confused of why
2:13
there was a hearing. Um so because of
2:18
unprecedented uh fallout uh volatility
2:23
uh and market disruption, you know, you
2:25
know, people people being able to
2:28
manipulate something um immediately.
2:32
A lot of people might have some concerns
2:35
for market structure or fairness. Um
2:39
some also some problems uh was one of uh
2:44
the trading apps uh for stocks and
2:48
shares. Uh Robin Hood um did not uh
2:53
allow people to buy for a certain period
2:55
of time from GameStop and only allowed
2:57
people to sell which made things a
3:00
little odd. um
3:03
if there you know and so forth you know
3:06
more questions you know the
3:08
congressional hearing you know covered
3:10
was you know uh well what do we do about
3:12
it and how can we possibly restrict it
3:15
and uh protect investors
3:18
um and you know now uh with the
3:22
conclusion uh they
3:25
uh the most sign the the most
3:27
significant action was the proposal to
3:30
increase transparency around
3:32
shortselling activities uh by requiring
3:34
large institutional investors to
3:36
publicly disclose more data on their
3:38
short positions. The House Committee on
3:41
Financial Services eventually released a
3:43
report confirming that significant
3:45
legislative and regulatory reforms are
3:48
needed to modernize the system
3:50
especially regarding uh quote unquote
3:52
super brokers like Robin Hood and uh
3:55
capital/ liquidity requirements. Um well
3:59
play uh payment for orderflow uh payment
4:01
for orderflow is uh the practice where
4:03
brokers like Robin Hood sell customers
4:06
trade orders to market makers like
4:08
Citadel uh securities. Um well that uh
4:12
that practice wasn't banned. Uh future
4:15
regula uh future regul regulation became
4:18
a key topic. um in Congress also
4:21
discussed on whether or not you know
4:23
trading apps like Robin Hood encourages
4:25
excessive or risky trading among
4:27
inexperienced retail investors. Um the
4:31
uh like overall GameStop ultimately led
4:34
to the closure of some hedge funds uh
4:36
most notably Melvin Capital which uh
4:39
suffered massive losses over 50%. Um, so
4:43
you know, if we're going over these key
4:44
data points, you know, uh, short
4:47
interest did peak at 140%. Um, retail
4:50
trading volume increased 10fold during,
4:53
uh, the short squeeze. Um, I didn't
4:55
really know what that was either. So,
4:56
short squeeze occurs when stock price
4:58
unexpectedly rises, which is bad for uh,
5:02
short sellers. So, short sellers is uh,
5:05
like are people who expect stock to go
5:07
down. So they make um like basically
5:10
agreements with people to uh like to buy
5:14
their stock uh like later or sell their
5:17
stock later and they make that agreement
5:19
to do so. So when it goes up and they no
5:21
longer have that stock to sell and earn
5:23
money off of or they have useless stock,
5:27
then you know it it doesn't work out.
5:30
They don't get money. Uh trading
5:32
restrictions uh implemented um at peak.
5:34
Yes, that was um true. Um
5:39
and uh
5:41
yeah uh okay so I I did go over all uh
5:46
the data above um and to test um market
5:51
efficiency. So uh in class we kind of
5:54
talked about this I think uh so
5:56
efficient mark uh like the market
5:58
efficiency to test the EMH um it's
6:02
basically to see how uh like the
6:04
relationship between public and private
6:07
um like information and how that impacts
6:11
uh how people like invest their money.
6:13
Um so like a weak form of market
6:17
efficiency states that you know prices
6:19
will always reflect historical
6:21
information. Um semi strong stocks uh
6:24
believes that um like stocks current uh
6:29
the current stock price reflects all
6:31
current public information. Um
6:34
information not available to the public
6:36
can help investors boost the returns.
6:39
But yeah, um uh strong is like the
6:44
current stock price reflects all public
6:46
and private information. So no matter
6:48
what information an investor might have,
6:51
they can't really have an advantage in
6:53
the market. Um
6:56
and I also uh so looking at uh collab
7:00
earlier, um so I had one code that
7:05
Gemini made for me. um that uh verified
7:10
you know the first statement of 0.04 um
7:14
which is incredibly not true because it
7:16
tests the high low the volume not match
7:18
and none of those match. Um
7:22
I had uh Gemini also uh this was uh
7:27
replicated from
7:30
uh like a prediction like a post
7:32
earnings announcement drift analysis uh
7:35
uh based on um uh what we went over in
7:38
class uh in the textbook. Um so let me
7:42
see where I wrote about post drift.
7:46
Um
7:48
yeah so uh post drift uh post
7:51
announcement drift refers to a situation
7:52
where the stock's abnormal return the AR
7:56
uh continues in the same direction for a
7:58
long period of time after a major piece
8:00
of public information has been released.
8:03
So major piece of public information
8:05
like um Ryan uh Ryan Cohen investing
8:09
13%. Um, also to to make a note about,
8:13
you know, public information. It's it's
8:15
really kind of hard to
8:18
uh interpret, you know, like it feels a
8:21
little weird to uh to think about the
8:24
efficient market hypothesis because it
8:25
relies on uh whether or not you have
8:28
like it's the relationship between
8:30
private and public information. that it
8:32
can be hard to um put numeric value to
8:36
information you don't know you don't
8:39
have. So it it can be a little
8:42
confusing. That was a little hard for me
8:44
to wrap my head around, but uh I do
8:47
think I got it. Um yeah, so to continue
8:52
um this was just a test. So in the
8:55
results uh pre- earnings uh average
8:57
abnormal return was 0.1
9:00
um to total earnings stress was 3.0
9:05
um
9:06
it was moderately efficient
9:10
um post earnings momentum strategy may
9:12
be profitable but consider transaction
9:14
cost market impact and risk. Um so going
9:18
down here uh we also have a graph made
9:22
from another code that uh calculates AR.
9:25
So you can it is all positive um
9:31
which is weird but it's still going
9:34
up in a posit so it's so it's going kind
9:37
of up for a good period of time which is
9:40
kind of that post drift. it goes down
9:43
for a couple like a couple of periods
9:45
which again a little odd. Um
9:51
so some things are violated there. Um
10:00
information
10:02
[Music]
10:05
so uh to compare uh EMH uh to observe
10:08
behavior some people uh you know predict
10:12
you know okay so how to also you know I
10:17
I don't I don't think we've went over
10:19
this in class but how do people like you
10:23
know how people in general predict uh
10:25
what the stock market is going to be.
10:27
They use fundamental analysis, technical
10:29
analysis, and quantitative analysis as
10:32
well as uh sentiment analysis. I didn't
10:35
really do those, but if I had a bit more
10:37
time, I probably would have invested
10:38
into it. Um I know I'm running out of
10:41
time, but uh some of the predictions for
10:44
uh 2020 was 3.31
10:48
uh which was a net loss. the people um
10:51
the price earnings uh people it was it
10:56
was negative. It was not doing well in
10:58
2019. You know, not not a lot of people,
11:01
you know, had hopes that there would be
11:02
a turnaround for uh GameStop considering
11:05
a lot of digital uh like copies of games
11:10
uh like uh Steam. So, it it wasn't you
11:15
know, people didn't have high hopes, but
11:16
you know why GameStop went up again. So
11:18
with Ryan uh Cohen as well as uh the
11:20
Redditors uh realized that collectively
11:23
if they bought and held some GameStop
11:24
shares, the stock price would rise as
11:26
the price rose dramatically. The short
11:28
sellers like again Melvin Capital would
11:30
be forced to buy back the shares to
11:32
quote unquote cover their short
11:34
positions and cut their losses. Um
11:39
uh I also uh had an Excel to you know uh
11:42
to use a t test um well to use a normal
11:46
like norm. this test uh to test you know
11:49
like if it was you know a weak form. So
11:52
I inputed all these adjun uh adjusted
11:56
closing from 2019 to 2021. Um I had the
12:00
expected return um and then I've found
12:04
the p value. The p value was less than
12:05
0.05 uh the alpha and therefore is
12:09
inefficient. So we can assume that the
12:12
market you know the market is bad and
12:15
also asking Gemini a bit more um
12:19
uh the profit uh the systematic uh
12:22
profit possible um weak form you know
12:25
profiting required understanding
12:26
structural flows um uh structural flaw
12:30
not just chart pattern so not really
12:33
getting profit getting profit off of uh
12:36
semi strong if car drifts which drifted
12:39
quite a bit So kind of yes from semi-
12:41
strong form um and from strong form um
12:46
uh yes but it would be illegal.
12:50
So yeah that's that's what I could kind
12:53
of shove into one video. I did go a
12:56
little overtime, but I hope I",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hello, I'm Harry White and today I will
be going over my session 8 assignment.
Uh for our session 8 assignment, we're
to investigate Marsh market efficiency
using the GameStop uh the short squeeze
of 2020 and 2021. uh we had to verify
the accuracy of the data stated facts we
got all the different things and analyze
price behavior relative to EMH which is
the efficient market hypothesis
predictions and evaluate whether market
anomy uh sorry market anomalies
constitute evidence against market
efficiency.
So basically for our critical first step
and for the define and discover of this
was to first identify and verify the
facts that we were provided. So, we're
provided with a statement GameStop
traded at 4 cents in August 2020. This
is not correct. So, if you come over
here, I have the data pulled up from
August 2020. Uh, you can see it right
here. This is the open, close, and the
high and low, all the adjusted closing,
all the things you need to know. And it
was never at 4 cents per share in the
month of August in 2020. floated around
a dollar in between a dollar and$2
dollars for the whole month and never
reached under a dollar let alone four
cents. So we realize that statement is
false and if it is incorrect they wanted
us to document the accurate figures
which we saw here which is floated
around 120 150ish around there
um and determine the appropriate
communication approach for correcting
the professor. So my communication to
the presser would be while the data
provided is incorrect, it can be noted
that G uh GameStop or GME was near
bankruptcy level in August 2020. That is
a true fact. Um not only did the
pandemic harm them, but from 2013 to
2019. Their stock dropped very very low.
um and they were seen as a failing
business in the eyes of many which did
cause the short squeeze because of how
many investors sold short on the stock
because of its failing nature. So going
back into the communications to the
professor beta must be corrected because
the difference between 4 cents and the
actual price floating around a$1 and2 is
a huge difference. Um but no one can
understand how this mistake was made.
So, while it was a failing business and
a stock shared at 4 cents is likely not
a do a business doing the best, um, I
would communicate to the professor that
this is something we need to fix and
it's something that must be known
because
a stock like GameStop that peaked at
$483 in 2021,
uh, saying that it was originally shared
at 4 cents in the month of August 2020
can lead many astray. So, our goal
basically, which I went over before, is
measure the market efficiency using
GameStop short squeeze. Uh, short
squeeze. The definition is when a stock
shoots up in price and investors who
sold short have to buy the stock in
order to limit their financial loss.
When an investor
uh sells or uh sells a stock short,
basically what that means is they're
betting on the stock to price to drop.
They buy it at five bucks. Basically,
what they're doing is they're taking the
stock from whoever the company itself
and then they will give it back once it
reaches a a different price. So, if you
invest $10,000 and the stock goes down,
you know, 5%, you're making a profit off
that because you're buying it at five
bucks and then you're selling it back to
them.
Sorry, you're buying the stock um and
betting on its failure. So that is a big
thing that happened with GameStop but we
will go into that for my represent um we
were given all the timeline and key data
points and we found that all of these
are true by doing research. I used an
article and did my research over Yahoo
Finance. Um they were near bankruptcy
level in August 2020. Uh Ryan Cohen did
invest and take a 10 uh eventually it
ended at I believe a 12.9% stake in the
company. That is true. He did promise a
company turnaround. He saw company that
could be successful
with uh better leadership. Uh in January
2021, Reddit uh r/wall street bets drive
the price search to $483. That is true.
You can see that right over here. Um if
I can find it.
Uh well, yep, right here. So, you can
see that. And then you come back over
here
and uh yeah, February 2021 congressional
hearings on market manipulation is true.
They wanted to make sure that no laws
were broken and no illegal insider
trading was happening. So all
information provided is true excluding
the fact that the stock was being traded
at 4 cents.
I utilized uh Yahoo Finance along with
other research and articles to confirm
the information we have provided for my
implement. I wanted to just quickly go
over the three kinds of EMH in the
market efficiency testing. So weak form
violation. Uh in this situation it is
being violated. Uh the short interest at
140% of float is public information.
Um sorry I don't know why I clicked
that. Um and one who was aware this
would have to would be able to predict
the stock boom. It follows patterns of
previous events and the large quantity
investors selling short points in the
direction of an an inevitable short
squeeze. So yes, the weak form was
violated in this situation for semi-
strong violation. This was also
violated. The peak stock price of $483
does not reflect public information in
the company itself, but rather the
circumstances it was in. What I mean by
that is the company was not evaluated.
It was not worth $483 a share, but
rather people saw their opportunity and
they pumped money into it because they
knew they could make money out of it.
Strong form violation. I did not see a
strong form violation present in the
scenario because uh it did not include
illegal insider trading. All the info
that the people on Reddit got was public
information.
While communication over Reddit led to
the stocks boom, illegal knowledge was
not utilized. and we can go on to my
Python analysis.
So basically I wanted to see the
financial health of GME and ask the code
to analyze it for me in 2020 leading up
to 2021 and its eventual boom. So as you
can see this is the data from 2019 2020
and 2021. I was very interested in 2019
to 2020 and also 2020 to 2021 because
the pandemic had such a large effect on
most companies, GameStop included, uh
especially an in in-person company that
sells things in person were bound to
fail during the pandemic due to the
increase in online platforms like
Amazon. So, as you can see, it has their
net sales, net income,
the e e uh sorry, e-commerce sales, the
total cash equivalents at the end of the
year, and the long-term debts they had.
You can see how in 2020 they were not
doing well at all. Um, you can see the
analysis of their financial health
revenue dropped significantly in 2020 um
to $59 million, but rebounded in 2021.
um the net income it was deeply uh
unprofitable in both years. Even though
the company boomed and their profit
increased um they were not seen as a
valuable company um and the net loss
widened in 2021.
So the balance sheet strength um the
primary change was a massive increase in
cash from 2020 to 2021 due to the
increase in investments
um and yeah and source of cash and debt.
It brought me this chart. The conclusion
it came to was from a fundamental
perspective, GameStop's financial health
was poor in 2020 and remained poor in
2021, which shows that
this stock was highly invested in not
due to company strength and people
seeing a chance for this company to turn
around and make money in the future. It
was only because so many people uh sold
it short and they saw that they could
make a short squeeze out of it. So yeah,
this is shows their net sales which was
down in 2020 and then their total cash
and equivalence at the end of the year.
Um so yeah for that is what I had for
implement for validate I wanted to
verify the information that my Google
collab code gave me. So I used GME uh
this I used market watch to go over
their data from 2021 and I wanted to see
if it lined up which it did. I did this
before and you can see their net income
before Extraordinaries was very low.
They were losing $215 million
shows the company was not in a great
spot. As you can see all this red and
everything they have, they were not
looking good, which proves my point
further that the investment in GameStop
was not due to company strength
for Evolve. Um, kind of just going over
what I've already said, GME's boom in
2021 was not due to promising results
from the company, but rather due to the
fact of large amounts of short selling.
Uh, another factor was the increase of
apps like Robin Hood, investment apps
that you can use on your phone, lowered
barriers of barriers to entry of
investments, and
it allowed everybody to pretty easily
invest in this.
um millions could easily invest in the
stock which was another crucial factor
in GameStop exploding.
Uh another big thing as we talked Reddit
was a huge platform used to promote this
and one of their main goals was not
making money but it was rather harming
hedge funds and taking down Wall Street.
So a lot of people had animosity. It was
co it was the pandemic where you know
people affluent people were making a lot
of money still and people were not
regular people weren't. So a lot of
people wanted to take them down. That
was a big factor in this occurring too.
GameStop is a company that sells video
games and anything consoles things
relating to online platforms in person.
While they do have an online website
they were based on fact on in-person
stores.
And as you can see, even over the last
couple years,
while we are not in a pandemic anymore,
uh, Amazon becoming one of the biggest
companies in the world due to the fact
that anybody can order something online.
So, GameStop's company model was
outdated and was unable to compete with
new companies like Amazon.
Um,
and yeah, so they were basically set up
for eventual failure. they were unable
to compete with online sales, especially
during the pandemic.
Um, that's all it for my evolve. For my
reflection, um, I knew about the
GameStop boom in 2021. It was
everywhere, all over the news. Um, I
even read articles like this where I use
this to go over my implementation, my
verification, and also my evolve. I
wanted to see people's takes on it now
that we're four years removed.
And this article comes from someone more
upset with the GameStop boom and the
attack on Wall Street, as you can see,
refers to him as a bunch of Reddit
geeks.
But um it just goes into depth. that
talks about apps like Robin Hood making
people making it easier for people to
invest
and talking about how tech companies
were not most popular to these people
and
campaigns against hate speech or
misinformation become throttling much
wider forms and can challenge authority
like people on Wall Street.
So, I knew about the boom in 2021, but I
never really dived deep into it more. or
I didn't really start investing myself
until 2023 to 2024.
This told me told me how to follow
market trends and find market
efficiencies and see how they apply.
This GameStop event is not a one-off,
but it is not go in line with market
patterns and it's not, you know, it's
not a trademark or a benchmark that you
can use for other investments like this.
Uh while market inefficiency will always
be present as well as insider trading,
one can avoid losing money by doing
proper research. That's what I learned
with this.
This made me go deeper into insider
trading and illegal knowledge being
spread around. I see this often with
politicians and while they're only
making six figures a year salary-wise,
they can
have, you know, hundreds of million
dollars in their bank accounts. And this
showed me and I was very interested. And
while I do disagree with politicians
making that much money due to their
insider trading knowledge and them
breaking the law, um I can also see the
other side and see how, you know, an
attack on Wall Street is not the best
thing for our economy. Um
but yeah, this taught me a lot. Stock
market can make a lot of people money.
You can lose people a lot of money. But
if you do your research, you are more
likely to make money if you are smart
with it. So investments are not always
about believing in a company or thinking
that they will have success, but rather
it can involve personal conflict in
one's personal beliefs and them spending
their own money to take down systematic
issues that they believe against. So
yeah, I learned a lot from this lesson.
Thank you very much.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Shealyn Wickstrom and I
will be going through our session 8
section five assignment.
Okay.
Um in this assignment I'm acting as a
risk manager at a h at a hedge fund and
recently we've experienced an 8% single
day loss
um which our current s risk system did
not predict. So
to start I used Gemini as always.
Um let me find my prompt here. Okay. I'm
going to move myself here real quick.
All right. So, I said I'm acting as a
risk manager at a hedge fund. I went on
to say all the given details of the
problem. Um, please act as my financial
adviser specializing in risk analysis. I
need to implement a value value at risk
and stress testing to create a better
risk monitoring system. help me help me
implement value at risk calculations in
Python.
And then for my define and discover, I
sort of just repeated the um given
information from the problem here.
And then I said I would like to create a
daily monitoring system. Um, it needs to
have a 95% confidence level
and my portfolio because I needed to
create a portfolio for the system to
analyze. I said it consists of Apple
holding 25% of the portfolio. Um, JPM
which is 20%, Microsoft 15%.
um TLT which is just a bond at 20 20% a
government bonds
or government treasury I think and then
um an S&P at 20%. Um and I included this
just so we could have a good measure of
what how the sort of general stock is
doing. Okay. And then I said run a risk
analysis on these investments as a step
in the risk system process.
Uh represent calculate value at risk in
multiple ways historical parametric and
Monte Carlo. Uh because I am running the
system daily it could be reasonable to
assume an expected return of zero. Um
account for volatility and possible
unprecedented events. I also need to
identify and ex
identify any expected shortfall or
conditional value at risk to identify
what conditions would be like if losses
go beyond the value at risk predictions
and then use stress testing to analyze
how the portfolio would perform in
different extreme scenarios such as
market crash or increased interest
rates.
All right. So then it went on here to
get to the coding. It gave me several
different outputs for each section that
I was asking for. Um, for example, this
first code that it gave me. Um, it's
sort of just defining my entire
portfolio and giving the historical data
so that we can use that to find um the
historical value at risk. Um, so the
first coding here was just kind of
laying out all of the defined
informations.
Um then it gave me another coding here
um specifying what I would want for the
historical um value at risk. Uh one day
95%
value at risk. Um that's basically
saying I'm 95% confident that blah blah
blah whatever it's going to output me.
um it gave me another code box here
which is doing the exact same thing but
for the parametric uh value at risk um
all the important calculations we have
the zcore here which is also just
representing the confidence level of
95%.
Um and then the Monte Carlo value at
risk, same thing. Um calculating the
same values with the same 95% confidence
level.
All right. And then it goes on to just
give more codes. We have for expected
shortfall. Um, which this basically is
going to give me what would happen if
if there was an an extreme enough event
to where we would go beyond our value at
risk threshold. Um, so in this case it
went to 8%. Which was beyond our
threshold. Um and the expected shortfall
is sort of saying what to what we would
expect to lose if we were to sort of
break that um limit.
All right. So it is going through we
have the historical right here Monte
Carlo right here. it did not give um the
expected shortfall for parametric um
which is basically giving a normal
distribution and I believe this is
because um if it's normally distributed
we wouldn't expect it to go beyond the
tail.
Um so I think that's why it didn't
return anything for that. And then same
for stress testing. Um I gave it the
scenarios of a market crash and
increased interest rates. Then what
would happen um to the portfolio
here it shows the different betas for
the different um investments in my
portfolio. That's basically just showing
the different elasticities or
correlations or sensitivities
of the individual um
stocks to the market as a whole.
And then perfect. Okay. So, I took all
of these different codes and I put them
into
collab,
which I will show here. All right.
So, here is just all of those same codes
just compiled all together into one big
cell.
and it output me with this here quite a
bit. Um, here at the top is just sort of
showing what would be in the portfolio.
Um, I believe these values here are log
returns per day per stock.
Um, so for example on November 6th for
Apple there was a negative return of 0
01
um and it says that it is using a total
trading days of 969. So it is going back
969 days into each of these um companies
port or yeah
company's stock information.
All right. So then we see here pulling
from that data we have the historical
value at risk. Um once again it's at a 1
day 95%
um meaning
in 1 day we are 95% confident for the
historical value at risk that we
wouldn't lose any more than 1.68%.
Um which in dollar terms would be about
$167,000.
Um, this is sort of just repeating this
here. We are 95% confident that on our
1-day loss will not exceed 1.68%.
Um, it did the same for parametric
value. Um, like I said before,
parametric is sort of just saying that
it's on a normal distribution and that
there are it's sort of assuming that
there are not really any extreme
outliers. Um, we have the zcore
representing
the confidence level of 95%.
And this one is saying that we wouldn't
expect a loss of more than 1.76.
So with the parametric, it's sort of
expecting
a little bit higher potentially higher
losses than the historical data. Then we
have the Monte Carlo value at risk. Um,
these values here are showing are
accounting for more extreme situations.
Um, it's simulating 10,000 one-day
outcomes. Um, so it's got a bit of a
broader database that it's pulling from.
Um,
and for that one day 95% value at risk,
it is negative 1.74%.
Um so not too far off from the
parametric here. Um moving on to the
expected shortfalls. So what would
happen if we did breach that boundary?
Um we have CV which is this this is just
saying conditional value at risk. Um for
the historical
method it is showing a -2.4 4 um
expected loss.
And for Monte Carlo, it is showing a
-2.18
expected loss.
Um moving on, this is sort of just
repeating everything I just said.
and to our stress testing scenarios. Um,
I found that this was the most important
part of the implementation stage um of
my assignment um cuz it sort of revealed
the what I think is the most important
information.
Um so this is when I gave it different
scenarios to deal with as a
hypothetical. So here we have asset
shocks.
Um,
oh, first it's showing the different
betas. That's what I wanted to mention.
Um, showing different betas for each of
the individual stocks. Sort of like I
mentioned earlier, um, how these
stocks would react to how the market
reacts as a whole. Um, and this is why
you see the S&P 500 stock at a value of
one because it would be moving the same.
It's unit elastic. it would be moving
the same as the market. Um, Apple is a
bit more elastic, um, bit more reactive
to how the market moves as a whole. And
TLT here, which is the government
treasury bond, um, that one is the least
elastic, uh, which makes sense. Um,
and then moving on to the different
scenarios. So, here's what I wanted to
really point out. um my first scenario
of an asset shock being a market crash
and it showed this here of an expected
loss of 8%. Um I thought that this was
really interesting um because in the
problem,
let's see if I can pull this up.
Perfect. In the problem, it said that
there was an 8% single day loss. Um, so
I thought that a market crash could very
well depict what is going on in this
scenario here. Um, given that 8% loss
here and about 8% loss here, it seems
like a very similar situation. Um, so
then what I did was went into Gemini.
One second.
Okay. So after sort of making that
connection um I went into Gemini and
said in the case I was provided there
was an 8% single day loss. When I ran a
value at risk simulation I found and
found potential outcomes for different
scenarios. I saw that a market crash
would lead to around an 8.1% loss. These
two situations seem comparable. In a
market crash scenario, how could I
improve my portfolio to be less volatile
and acquire less risk? Um, and it in a
nutshell, it basically told me to better
diversify. Um, it said that my current
portfolio is pretty equity dependent, I
believe is what it said. Um, 80% of the
portfolio in assets that are highly
correlated to the S&P 500. So, it said
um a potential solution
that I could have is to add an
additional I'm not sure if it's here,
but is to add an additional um
investment in my portfolios that would
sort of offbalance all of the highly
sensitive um
um investments that I already have. So
for example, I could invest in gold.
Um that was one of the options and that
is what I decided to go with.
So
after finding that I went into collab.
I ran the exact same code as I did
before. However, this time I used my
Gemini here um
to say I now want to update my portfolio
and reallocate my investments. Um let's
see if I can find what I said.
Oh, well, it's not showing what I said.
Oh,
I said I want to change my portfolio
slightly, but run the same test. My new
portfolio is Apple with 20%, Microsoft
10%, JPM 15%, spy 15%, TLT 20%, and now
gold at 20%. So now I have a more spread
out portfolio
and it returned me with
this here. Um all of this initial
information remain the same. Um for the
historical V I still have the same um
expected losses. Same for parametric
Monte Carlo. All of this is consistent.
Um what what is most important to look
at is that scenario that I had earlier
um the market crash scenario
and with that now no more diversified
portfolio
um I would expect a loss of only about
negative
of only about 5% losses um which is a
lot better and less risky. So for my
solution of a new risk system or a
proposal of a different way to allocate
um investments,
I would recommend to add some
investments that aren't so sensitive to
the market as a whole. Um so that if
there were something like a market crash
or
or something of that nature um we would
be a bit more balanced out and be
acquiring less risk. And that is all.
Thank you.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, today I'm going to be talking about
0:04
session 8 assignment market efficiency
0:06
investigation
0:08
and I'm just gonna take a deep dive
0:10
right into it and hop right into the
0:12
driver format. So first thing we're
0:14
going to do is sort of go about our the
0:16
given information that was given in the
0:18
problem and all the context within that
0:21
information. So the assignment asked for
0:23
an investigation of the efficient
0:25
efficient market hypothesis EMH using
0:28
GameStop short GameStop short squeeze
0:31
from 2020 to 2021 as a case study. Our
0:34
timeline was in August 2020 GameStop
0:37
GameStop neared bankruptcy. In September
0:40
2020, Ryan Cohen acquires 13% stake on
0:43
the company. In January 2021,
0:47
Reddit
0:48
uh stated that Red Reddit said that wall
0:52
in Wall Street bets drove a surge to
0:56
$483.
0:58
Uh and in February 2021, congestion, we
1:01
get congestion hearings. The given data
1:04
points, short interest is greater than
1:08
140% of float. Retail volume increased
1:11
by 10%. Trading restrictions like Robin
1:14
Hood were in place. Melvin Capital was
1:16
at a 53% loss and analysis fundamental
1:20
value was from 10 to $40.
1:24
Next, we're throughout this in this
1:27
assignment, we're going to have to
1:28
verify the statement of GameStop having
1:30
a trading value of 0.4 cents in August
1:34
2020.
1:36
The financial object objectives of the
1:38
video. So my primary goal is to use a
1:41
driver framework to analyze GameStop
1:45
event and its implications of the market
1:49
efficiency. My video is going to include
1:51
first the critical first step of the
1:54
price point of 0.4 trading value
1:57
uh test of which EMH weak semi strong or
2:01
strong was violated. An analysis of
2:04
behavioral basises hurting and
2:06
overconfidence
2:07
and their roles. An evaluation of limits
2:10
of arbitr arbitrage arbitrage sorry. And
2:14
a clear conclusion on whether the this
2:17
event disproves EMH or can explain
2:20
within a broader framework.
2:23
Still in define and discover. So we're
2:26
going to go over some understandings of
2:29
financial terminology. Efficient market
2:32
hypothesis. A weak form. Past prices
2:35
don't predict future prices. A semi-
2:37
strong form. All public information is
2:39
already reflected in the prices. A
2:41
strong form. All information public and
2:44
private is reflected in the price. A
2:46
short squeeze is a rapid increase in a
2:49
stock's price triggered by a large
2:50
number or of short sellers. Short
2:54
sellers being forced to cover buy back
2:56
or or buy back their positions. Float
2:59
short interest or float is the
3:02
percentage of a company's tradable
3:04
shares the float that have been short
3:08
sold. A value of greater of 100% like
3:11
100 like 140% is highly unusual and
3:15
indicates extreme
3:18
um bearish sentiment and high risk.
3:21
Behavioral finance a field that argues
3:24
the psychological basis like hurting uh
3:27
affecting investor decisions. Limits of
3:30
arbitrage real world factors like risk
3:33
transaction co costs or game or in
3:37
GameStop's case an inability to borrow
3:39
shares to short
3:42
that prevent rational traders from
3:44
correcting mispricings.
3:47
Now on to represent analytical our
3:50
analytical plan and what we're going to
3:53
find. So first is going to be the
3:56
critical step. I need as I stated
3:58
earlier I need to find out the actual
4:00
historical stock prices of GameStop in
4:03
August 2020.
4:05
This is going to be the first
4:06
implementation step
4:09
a semi strong form test. So I need to
4:13
find the dates for public information
4:15
releases Ryan Co Cohen stake in
4:18
September 2020 mounting a short interest
4:21
data and compare them to the stock
4:23
price. If the price didn't react
4:25
immediately but rather slowly then
4:28
and then explosively it's a strong
4:30
violation of the semi- strong form. A
4:33
weak form test. I'll look for the price
4:36
chart which technically which while
4:39
technical analysis is weak form couldn't
4:42
predict the event the monumental driven
4:45
runup in 2021 shows that past prices
4:49
were being used by traders to make
4:51
decisions which challenged the weak form
4:55
behavioral biases hurting retailer
4:57
traders
4:59
coordinating on Reddit overconfidence
5:04
uh belief that believe they could beat
5:07
the hedge funds. So these are both
5:09
different types of behavioral biases
5:12
that will probably be seen in this case
5:15
study. Limits of arbitrage. Why couldn't
5:17
hedge funds just short it back down?
5:22
Because it was too risky and costly.
5:25
They faced margin calls. And this little
5:30
insight right there is very important in
5:32
the rest of the presentation.
5:37
Now, still in represent, we're going to
5:39
go over some formulas and concepts that
5:42
may be used in this presentation. So
5:47
abnormal return is going to be AR.
5:52
Abnormal return equals the return of JME
5:56
market and the return of the market
5:59
where our market could where this part
6:03
could just be the SPI 500 which is
6:06
usually used as a baseline and that will
6:09
quantify GameStop's return detached from
6:13
the market. Short interest percent is
6:15
short sold is shares short sorry sorry
6:19
shares sold short overflow I'm not going
6:22
to calculate this but I will use an 140%
6:26
figure as stated in the key given points
6:29
I previously said core concepts so the
6:32
EMH forms limits of ar ar ar ar ar ar ar
6:34
ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar
6:34
arbitrage and behavioral and behavioral
6:36
biases are the main analytical tools
6:38
that we'll probably be focusing on
6:41
throughout this
6:44
Now on to implement. I have two Python
6:48
codes that I used to sort of back up all
6:51
my statements. So my first impleation
6:53
step as I said earlier is going to be
6:55
the critical first step of verifying the
6:59
trading cost of 0.4
7:02
cents in August 2020. And I'm going to
7:06
go to that one. So up here we have the
7:10
code. It's importing NES necessary
7:14
libraries from Yahoo Finance and Pandas.
7:19
So, first we're going to do the get
7:21
GameStop data,
7:23
get the historical data from 2020, and
7:26
then they're going to filter out August
7:27
2020 to see that specific timeline.
7:31
Display the data of August 2020. It's
7:35
going to be open, high, low, and closed.
7:38
find the absolute lowest price of that
7:40
month, which
7:43
will then see that'll kind of be what
7:46
the trading value was. We're going to
7:47
come down here to the run data. You can
7:49
see everything throughout the month of
7:51
August. And the critical finding is that
7:54
the lowest price GameStop traded in
7:56
August was 2020
7:58
in um in 2020 was a dollar, not 0.4
8:02
cents.
8:05
I'm
8:06
04 cents.
8:08
which so that invalidates the statement
8:10
that we had to verify before. That was
8:13
our first step. Now we're going to sort
8:16
of widen that data range to visualize
8:18
the entire squeeze event as outlined in
8:20
my represent plan. This will be helpful
8:22
to analyze the EMH and I'm going to go
8:25
to my next collab.
8:28
Okay, up here we have the data. We still
8:31
have the importing information from

8:36
Um, we're going to define GameStop,
8:40
sorry. Get data from the full event
8:43
period. So, 2020 to 2021, that was
8:45
stated as the squeeze period. Create a
8:48
price chart. Um, we're going to have
8:52
GME's closed prices that we saw in the
8:54
previous collab
8:56
and all prices from 20202
8:59
to 2021 price in USD dollars and dates.
9:04
and we're going to have a label of the
9:06
peak squeeze.
9:09
The next then our second volume chart is
9:11
gonna our second chart is going to be a
9:13
volume chart. We're going to have the
9:16
volume
9:17
um GameStop's trading volume of 2020 to
9:21
2021, the dates, the share traded, the
9:23
shares that were traded, which is the
9:25
volume, and we're going to also have the
9:28
peak squeeze event sort of highlighted.
9:32
These are both of our
9:36
uh charts. Sorry, let me scroll down. I
9:40
would like to point out that in our
9:41
first chart, the
9:45
uh pricing is skewed to fit everything
9:47
into the chart. It wasn't $80. As I
9:49
previously said, prices went up to $483.
9:52
That's sort of the skew of this chart,
9:54
but it's you can still kind of see the
9:56
trends. Um,
10:00
and GameStop shows how many shades were
10:02
shares were traded throughout the year
10:03
of 2020 to 2021. And I'm going to go
10:06
back to
10:10
my implement to go into a deeper dive of
10:12
the understandings standings of this
10:14
chart these charts. So first as I said
10:17
the chart is of for the first chart of
10:20
price the chart was scaled and because
10:23
prices reached $483
10:25
in 2021.
10:28
Uh so this chart captures the famous
10:31
short squeeze where traders betting
10:34
against GameStop were forced to buy
10:36
shares to cover their losses pushing the
10:38
prices up dramatically and the volume
10:40
spike
10:42
uh below miring or beside mirroring the
10:45
sudden surge is in trading activity. You
10:49
can see price everything was low low.
10:52
Then the squeeze hit and it shot up it
10:56
and before you can see that prices for
11:01
the tradings were at under $10.
11:05
Um so the fact that it shot up
11:09
to $483 is kind of insane and then it
11:12
kind of went onto a big down
11:15
and then it kind of started to go up and
11:17
down again. But you can see the effect
11:19
of the main
11:21
like the main squeeze just kind of
11:24
upping up prices basically permanently.
11:28
Then we're going to go to our next chart
11:31
which is the trading GameStop's trading
11:33
volume. This chart shows the explosion
11:35
of trading interest during GameStop
11:37
short squeeze when retail investors
11:40
flooded the market causing mass over
11:42
turnover in shares. You can see all
11:45
pretty low. There's a small spike right
11:48
here, but nothing compared to the short
11:50
squeeze.
11:51
Um, and then it started to go back down
11:54
again.
11:56
That was my implement stage. And now
11:58
we're going to go to validate.
12:02
So the question that we have to ask
12:03
ourselves, did it work? And what does it
12:06
mean? That being our code and what did
12:09
our code mean? So the code ran
12:11
successfully. Now we're going to
12:13
validate the output
12:15
um that it gave us. So the validation
12:17
number one, the claim of zero of 04
12:22
cents being traded. So the code output
12:25
shows that the lowest price in August
12:27
2020 was a dollar not
12:32
04 cents. So that statement is
12:34
incorrect.
12:35
for the assignment. I will be then using
12:38
the correction to sort of understand the
12:40
real data
12:42
of GameStop. Then the validation number
12:46
two, the event charts price chart. So
12:49
the price chart logically matches the
12:51
assignment's timeline. We see low flat
12:54
in 2020 following the truly
12:58
um large vertical spike in January 2021.
13:04
And then our volumes chart. The volume
13:06
chart is just as important. It confirms
13:08
the T-fold retail increase by showing a
13:11
massive unprecedented spike in trading
13:14
volumes that line up perfectly with
13:16
price spike.
13:20
Now to evolve the current state, we have
13:23
a visual confirmation of the spike. We
13:27
can see it in our two charts up here.
13:30
there was a huge spike
13:34
um for future evolution
13:36
as suggested in the assignment. So we're
13:39
going to calculate abnormal returns.
13:43
Uh the next up would be to apply the
13:45
KAPM framework. I would run an a
13:48
regression of GameStop's returns against
13:50
the S&P 500 which is the market proxy
13:54
before the event to find its beta. And
13:57
then I would do an event study. So I
14:00
would then use the beta to calculate the
14:01
expected returns during the squeeze and
14:03
compare it to the actual returns. The
14:06
difference between the abnormal returns
14:08
which would be
14:10
um
14:14
statistically massive sorry and then a
14:18
sentimental analysis. A more advanced
14:20
step would then to be would be to then
14:24
use the NLP which is the natural
14:27
language processing to scrape the Reddit
14:30
forum and qualifying market sentiments
14:33
testing its correlation with its price
14:37
onto our reflect. So was the market
14:40
efficient? The weak form was violated.
14:43
The entire event was a form of a form of
14:47
mu momentum
14:49
driven by social hurting. Past price
14:52
action and Reddit post did influence the
14:55
future buying and is a clear violation
14:57
of the weak form. As for the semi-
14:59
strong form, it was also clearly
15:01
violated. This is the smoking gun. All
15:05
information like the 140% short interest
15:10
um in the Reddit plans was public. In an
15:13
efficient market, the price should be
15:16
insane should have insane in instantly
15:19
reflected this. Instead, it built up
15:22
slowly and then exploded by driven by
15:25
behavior, not fundamentals. The $10 to
15:28
$40 analyst estimates were completely
15:30
ignored.
15:34
Um the EMH um the EMH versus behavioral
15:39
finance. So this event is a poster child
15:42
for behavioral finance. It proves that
15:44
markets can remain irrational longer
15:46
than short sellers can remain solvent.
15:49
Key factors hurting the social media and
15:51
overconfidence real retail versus
15:53
hurting funds and limits to arbitr
15:57
arbitrage. The rational trade of
15:59
shorting GameStop became impossible
16:02
impossibly risky, allowing for
16:04
irrational price to perish.
16:08
Now, I'm going to sort of go over what
16:11
each step had in the driver framework
16:14
that I just went over. So, the power of
16:16
define the driver for framework forced
16:18
me to address the critical first step
16:20
before doing any analysis. This saved me
16:22
from using a flawed premise of a 0.04 04
16:27
trading value and immediately
16:28
demonstrated a high level of diligence.
16:31
Finance first co- second. The implement
16:33
stage was not about writing a fancy
16:36
code. It was about using simple code to
16:38
answer specific financial questions from
16:41
my represent plan. The charts I
16:43
generated directly supported my
16:44
financial conclusions. And for my
16:47
conclusion, the GameStop event shows
16:49
that while markets may be mostly
16:51
efficient most of the time, they are not
16:53
immune to behavioral biases. Social
16:55
medias and structural flaws like limits
16:57
to arbitrage can lead to profound and
17:00
dramatic anomalies.
17:02
Thank you so much for watching my video
17:05
and I hope you learn from it.

",FALSE,1,"Hi, my name is Sean and this is my video for section A section A market efficiency and behavior finance. In this assignment, I'm going to test how well the efficient market hypothesis or EMH explains what happened during the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 and 2021 using the drivers framework. So, start with define and discover. Uh the question I'm exploring is did prices around the GameStop squeeze behave efficiently or were behavior behavioral forces driving them. So for the assignment I'm addressing five required analysis which is provided here. So first and you'll see each of them in my notebook later. So the first is to verify historical price data and document corrections. Second test which form of market efficiency like weak, semi- strong or strong was violated. Third is evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically after frictions. Four is to compare the EMH predictions to observe behavior. And the last one is excess behavioral explanations and limits to AR arbitrage. So for data I use GME for the stock and spy as the market is proxy and the timeline runs from June 20 2020 to uh March 2021 capturing the uh the runup peak and aftermath and the event date is January 27 20 uh 2021 and the date before Robin Hood imposed trading restrictions. Now um also the code I generated is all from CHPT and now let's look at the results of running after running the code in Google Collab. So first the first step is to do price verification um as as required by the assignment. So I begin with a quick data audit. So using the sto adjusted closed data and the GameStop trade did between um $1.04 04 and 1.67 um per share dollars per share in August 2020. So earlier figure of um the 0.04 um dollars appears to be inaccurate inaccurate across the major data vendors. So I'm simply documenting this clarification. So the GameStop was in a low single undigit territory around like one to$2 not 0.04 dollars and that fulfills like the first requirement to verify and record the uh factual corrections. Second step is to do volume analysis. I look at the trading volumes during August to September 2020. the GameStop average around about like 35 million shares per day. And in the week of January 25, 2021, the volume exploded uh roughly 447 million shares per day and 12.6 times increase and this is this confirms the massive surge of retail trading participation during the squeeze. Now going to represent section. In the represent stage I outlined the event uh study framework I used to test efficiency. So the estimation window covers 60 trading days until uh ending at like t= um1 and the event window is t = 10 to 10 uh to positive negative 10 to positive 10. And I estimated a simple CAPM with um RJME equals alpha plus beta * R MKT and and abnorm return equals R RME minus um bracket alpha like this this section alpha plus beta* RM and KT bracket and and sum those you can get the cumulative abnormal return which is C and if the market were perfectly semi- strong efficient abnormal returns would appear only on day zero and it disappear right after. So persistent drift after day uh zero would indicate a semi- strong form violation. Now going to an implement section. In implement state we regression the regression results uh show like the first is alpha equals 0 um 4766% per day and beta shows 2.235 and the residual standard deviation shows 6.51%. The R squar is 0.104 104 um and the with 59 days in the estimation window and a beta above two means um GameStop moved more than twice as much as the market which is a clear evidence of extremely high systematic risk. So the u from the result of the first chart and shows the price and volume um plot. This chart combines like the price in blue and the volume as a bars and you can see the price jumping from single digits to single digits to over like 80 um exactly at the event line like here and which with volume spiking past 400 million shares. And that pattern matches like a classic short squeeze rather than a rational reaction to um new fundamental information. And for the abnormal returns um this like this graph below these two graphs below in the top panel which is this one we see daily abnormal returns at day zero shows a huge positive bar um followed by a lingering positives on day plus one and plus two then sharp um then then sharp negatives as the price collapsed and in the bottom panel the cumulative AR rises to around um plus 400 um you can see 400 plus 400 basis points by day zero and peaks immediately after like which is this one and and falls back. So this drift indicates that not all information was absorbed instantly and a semi- strong efficient violation driven by a behavioral momentum and tension spillovers. So a quick uh significant check uh my simplified test shows the average post amount AR is from PL plus one to + 5 and of um a negative four a negative -4 a negative 14.279% and C of 0 to positive five of plus 68.42% 42% with a rough T stat of 4 uh 4.29 29 and that's stat statistically large but economically short-lived abnormal returns were quickly reversed as uh the trading con constraints it constraints hits for valid uh for validation um here's how I validated the findings first the statistical significance so the C around is around 68% t equals 4 definitely non zero second um economic economic significance. It's not easily exploitable because of Robin Hood restrictions and extreme um volatility. The third is persistence. So the drift collapsed within days and temporary mispricing, not a repeatable pattern. The fourth is risk adjustments. So a beta over two means part of the return was just high systematically risk. So even though the event looked inefficient in the short term, it was not systematically profitable once real world frictions are included. And for evolve to evolve analysis, I noted four next steps that we could make to study more robust. So the first is to shift the event date to January 28, 2021. and the um the day trading restrictions actually hit. And the second is extend the estimation window to 120 days to stabilize um beta. And third is to replicate the study for AMC as a pure case. And the last one is to add a bootstrap significance test for C to avoid normal norm normality assumptions. for reflection. Um my reflection is that the markets are mostly efficient efficient but when attention like social media and trading constraints collide and they can deviate sharply from fundamentals and the GameStop case illustrates how hurting like overconfidence and attention bias can drive temporary bubbles. So like for investors the lesson is to respect the market baselines but stay alert uh for rare moments when behavioral forces create short-term distortions and that's how behavioral finance and like the efficient market hypothesis come together in real time. Thank you very much.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi everybody, my name is Jacob and today we're going to be going through my session 8 weekly video assignment which covers market efficiency um and the whole chapter with that. Obviously, as always, we're going to be using the driver framework to solve the problem and to work through our analysis. So, let's go ahead and get started. So the problem in general was to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze events of 2020 and 2021 as a case study using the facts that we were given as well as some analysis into it to figure out if all of this data was correct. So the first step of this framework was to go in we're going to come back down to the defined and discovery stage. Our critical first step was to verify the statement that we were given and that was that GameStop GameStop stock traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. And that statement is incorrect. The actual adjusted closing price was approximately 26 to 42 times higher. Um anywhere between a dollar and $1.70. Um so 4 cents pretty much would have been a near worthless status. It would have been pretty much worth nothing. Um so when we looked into research, we did some details into Yahoo Finance and everything like that. We realized that that number was incorrect. So for the rest of our analysis, we assumed and we used the actual data between a dollar and $1.70, which made a little bit more sense. Um, and then it also asked us to be able to communicate that with the professor. So, I wrote a little bit of an email right in the middle right here. Um, just describing what I figured out and also why I thought that those values in that 4 cents didn't exactly work. So, with that data corrected and figured out, we also established our core question and our core objective, which is to investigate the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 and 21 as an empirical case study to literally assess the degree and the nature of market efficiency failure. So, we're going to pull in a time period analysis between September 2020 and March of 2021, drawing a conclusion regarding the form of market efficiency that was violated. Obviously, there are three different forms, which we're going to get into in just a second. Our key information, our key resources, market efficiency testing, behavioral finance analysis, that's all right here. And then the data we're going to use, we're going to use Yahoo Finance data as well as market index index data from the S&P 500, as well as a little bit of interest rate calculations here. Simply right here found down at the bottom is a list of the timeline. So in August of 2020, GameStop is near bankruptcy levels. It's not at a level of 4 cents like it was indicated in the problem, but it is definitely pretty low around a dollar to $1.70. Month later, Ryan Cohen acquires a 13% stake in the company. And then in January of 2021, this is really where everything picks up. A Reddit account um and Reddit at Bets drive the price of the stock almost up to $500 per share. And then a little bit later on, congressional hearings go into market manipulation and then everything kind of draws back down to normal. So we're going to really look at how that one little bit and how the outside factors can actually influence the market as a whole. So that's really off from the define and discover stage. Let's jump a little bit into the representation side of things. We're going to start off obviously using the driver framework to drive our analysis. We already established the problem and verified the facts, but our represent stage is really where we're going to formalize the analytical methodology. We're going to analyze our analytical blueprint for how we're going to use our GameStop data to test this efficient market hypothesis. We're going to go into the implement stage. We're going to execute it. We're going to run code and generate results with some graphs. Then we're going to test sign statistical significance, everything like that. Interpret our findings a little bit and then synthesize that all together at the end. If you look right here, I defined out the three forms of efficient market hypothesis. Weak form where you focus solely on past prices using autocorrelation analysis. a semi-strong form where you focus on public news and statistical tea tests and then the strong form which you use all of the information kind of like insider training and you do a qualitative assessment. Our main tool for this whole situation is event study methodology. It allows us to kind of measure the price reactions to use. We're going to actually use the market model, which is a form of the CAPM to use used to establish GameStop's normal expected return or ER based on its normal relationship with the S&P 500. We're going to calculate the abnormal return or AR, which simply is the stock's actual return minus its expected return. And so we're going to figure out the difference in that and then we're going to sum all of those up throughout the year throughout that period to find the cumulative of normal returns or C for this situation. Now with getting a lot of that stuff out of the way, we're going to jump a little bit right into our Google Collab kind of see exactly where we're going from here. So you start it off as always, you want to import all of the necessary data analysis software as always. So I imported those and then I defined my parameters right here. So when I wanted the periods to start and end. And then I ran my data synthesis. So pulling data out from Yahoo Finance, pulling data from the market to kind of figure out how is GameStop working through this period of time and how is everything situated. And then here we have graphical analysis software right here to build it out. So I built this with Gemini. Then when you come down to right here, it's using this real realistic synthesized data to actually ensure the completion to help understand it right here. So the objective of this stage is to utilize the market model which is a simplified application of the capital assets pricing model to establish their normal relationship with the S&P 500. And we focused on two distinct periods throughout this time. An estimation window from March to September of 2020 and then the actual event window from September of 2020 to about March of 2021. So that estimation window was really when we trained the regression model to kind of figure out what is the situation going on right now, what's predictable and then the event window when everything happens. So we can compare it using an ordinary le squares regression model kind of figure out what was going on. And when you are doing this market model regression, you get two main data points, two key metrics. The first one is beta. Beta is simply your systematic risk which we calculated to be.32. Beta simply is your risk relative to the overall market. So a negative beta such as that indicates that the stock historically moves inversely to the market. But since it's super low, it's actually very weak. So for every 1% change in the S&P 500, GameStop's expected to move about 32% in the opposite direction. So based on the data, GameStop didn't behave like the high volatility market trading stock prior to the squeeze, but its price movements were only slightly negative correlated to everything else, which is something we're going to look into in just a little bit. And then the other metric is alpha, which we analyzed and we calculated to be 1.58%. Alpha is simply a stock's risk adjusted performance relative to what the cap capital assets pricing model predicts. So a positive alpha indicates that after controlling for risk, which is beta, GameStop was generating actually slightly higher returns than expected. So when the market's flat, GameStop's going to perform a little bit better positively in comparison to everything else. But it suggests that marginal overperformance is can get risk adjusted back into everything else. And what do all of these mean? calculates into that cumulative abnormal return which really isolates the unexpected results generated during that specific event window that happens. So we calculated the abnormal return daily using some calculations down over here and then subtracted that from the actual return that we got normally. By summing it up we got about 595% which is pretty much statistically unexplainable. physically can't happen in the market. Even if situations happen in the market that are quote unquote drastic, it can't get up to that number. So, it's statistically unexplainable by the fundamental risk and the movement of the market, which means that it's quantifiable evidence of a market anomaly that was caused by the event, which we'll get into. Obviously, the Reddit did have an impact on it, but this helps to prove that right out there. We're going to scroll down. We have a few charts that we also want to talk about, some visualizations to kind of just help us figure out and see everything going on. The first one is the GameStop price history, um, which shows the event spike. You can see right here the unprecedented price appreciation right over here during the event window. Starts off, it stays pretty stagnant throughout the entire time, then strikes all the way up right over here. It's a speculative bubble. It completely detaches from its normal fundamentals from where it normally is. You can see even in those periods right after it starts to drop back down and eventually it's going to drop all the way back down. Your daily returns are right over here. The plot highlights the extreme volatility of that GameStop stock. Especially during the event right over here you can see it drops. It spikes all the way up. Then it drops all the way back down right after it was just a moment in time. It was just a ma moment of an event. That magnitude of these returns exceeds anything observed in the estimation period. right over here. You can see it's up and down, but it's nothing of this magnitude, which shows and for and proves this high cumulative abnormal returns value. And then the last one is that cumulative average abnormal returns chart throughout the event window. So you pull it up, you can see it tracks the accumulation of the unexpected returns. The massive almost vertical trajectory right over here confirms that market failure was pretty much systematic throughout the entire event. The sharp increase right over here helps us to statistically challenge the semi- strong form of the efficient market hypothesis right over here. This isn't something that can physically happen normally. Now after all this data analysis, we wanted to get a little bit into it. Let's get into the statistical significance testing with all the validation. So again, we're going to pull in all of our necessary data analysis tools that we're going to use. And then we perform some t tests and some t calculations to look at significance. We also look at some different tests that we can do. So the first one is a t test on the cumulative abnormal returns which we calculated previously. The test is the essential mechanism for looking at the semi- strong form of that efficient market hypothesis. It's governed by the null hypothesis that the cumulative abnormal returns is equal to zero. Pretty much meaning that the event had no effect on the actual price or the market value of the stock. So the so the empirical evidence calculated from this console provides the proof that we've been looking for forever. The calculated t statistic is extremely high right over here at around 3.71. That measures how many standard deviations it's away from the baseline. You know three standard deviations away means it's 99.9%. In the middle is those three standard deviations. So it's even farther away from that. A value this large simply demonstrates that extreme divergence from what can happen normally in the market then your p value right here is very very small as well pretty much meaning that if we were to deserve a cumulative abnormal return of this magnitude the market doesn't work like that so because that we reject the null hypothesis we understand that this event that happened is not a normal event that happens in the market this really leads us to our primary conclusion throughout the situation the GameStop event is statistically proven a violation of the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis. The returns were generated by publicly available information and can't simply be explained by GameStop's fundamental risk relationship with the market as a whole. We actually ran a different test as well to literally look a little bit more into the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. It's called the ling box test which challenges that weak form right over there by testing and looking at autocorrelation within abnormal daily returns. The no hypothesis states pretty much that abnormal returns are independent meaning that there's physically no predictability. That statistic is 363.2. That p value is almost zero. It's less than that threshold of 0.05. Meaning we reject that null hypothesis of independence. That means that the abnormal returns exhibit significant autocorrelation demonstrating a violation of that hypothesis. The movement was not random rather everything happened for a reason and it's predictable meaning that it a lot of times is resulting of behavioral forces like trading momentumly or in this case a Reddit post and Reddit threads which pulled everything in together. So overall this validation stage really just helped us to look more detailed into the data that we had and figure out is this the truth and we realized through all of this through some behavioral finance analysis before we jump into the evolve stage that yes all of this is true. Now the evolve stage we wanted to synthesize everything together a little bit come up with some final conclusions as well as just a little bit more information that we'll need. So we ran a lot of the conclusions and the tests one more time to kind of figure out everything as a whole. So this evolved stage is to really connect the proven market failures, the significant cumulative average abnormal return and predictability to the theoretical framework of behavioral finance and what that is. The GameStop event was not an anomaly. As we've said a lot of times, it was the product of human error. We looked at autocorrelation. We looked at confirmation and behavioral bias and everything like that. Let's look a little bit down here at the limits to arbitrage and the persistence of the anomaly right over there. The statistically proven abnormal rate challenges a fundamental principle of the efficient market hypothesis which is the role of arbitrage. The anomaly persisted because investors were prevented from correcting the price. Meaning that they didn't have the power. They didn't even have the ability to do what they were doing. The limits weren't theoretical, but they were actually riskbased and structural. So, it's interesting to look at everything as a whole. When you're looking at some implications for an investment strategy, it actually challenges that efficient market hypothesis. The dual violation proves that systematic inefficiency exists within the market. It also limits the active strategy, the high beta and the extreme volatility. Highlight the danger of exploiting the anomaly. So, you know, from a lot of people who invested a lot of money into GameStop the moment they saw it going up, even after it went up and they could have possibly made their money back, it crashed a few days later, crashed a few weeks later. So even the people that put their money in when it was low, when it crashed back down, it was all the way at the bottom again. So they weren't even making money and a lot of times they were actually losing money into it. And then just some behavioral rationale that predictability is best explained by herd behavior. It's the understanding that people are going to follow the actions and the decisions of others, especially when they don't have all of the information in their hands. They're going to look just a little bit more and just follow the leader pretty much and figure everything out. So let's jump a little bit into this final stage which is the reflection stage where we're going to synthesize everything we had together the efficient market hypothesis as well a little bit of behavioral findings as well. The primary finding in this event study is that dual violation of market efficiency which is shown by two things. It's the statistically significant cumulative abnormal returns which was calculated by the t test and it's the proven predictability proven by the box test. Those two work together to help us build out our full analysis. Right here, you can see that the semi-strong is a failure as well as the weak form is also a failure as well. This dual dual failure creates a fundamental conflict with the assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis which possess that markets are ruled by perfectly rational actors. Here's the empirical data shown by our p values that we have proved that our assumption is perfect of assumption of perfectly rational markets failed during this event. So this event that happened is not something that's normal. And then while this market hypothesis provides a baseline, behavioral finance is super important for explanation. We have all of those down up in the top. And then the failure was caused simply by hurting behavior um and protected by severe limits to arbitrage. people and investors weren't able to put barriers in the right place to continue and limit this case from happening. It just continued to happen and snowballed into what we see today. Then our final takeaway overall is that the GameStop event showed that collective human emotion actually can and it actually did override fundamental economics. So it's something very interesting to look at. It actually created statistically significant and systematic anomalies which we've seen into the market today and created severe stress requiring extraordinary intervention such as trading restrictions implemented by brokers at the market's peak which highlights the need for regulation to account for extreme behavioral risk so that situations like this don't happen again and again. That's all I have for this market efficiency investigation. Looking a little bit into GameStop. I hope I answered all the questions that were asked and everything in relation to the stock. It was really interesting to look at it from a different side of things. I learned about the GameStop situation. I lived through it and saw a little bit of it. Never put any money into it or messed with it, but it was definitely interesting and an important thing to look at. I'm glad we did this whole project. And that's all I have. So thank you.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"Hi, I'm Cherry J and this is my session
A assignment. Sorry if I sound a little
bit weird. Got a code. Anyways, let's
start with the find and discover. Our
objective is to investigate the market
efficiency of GameStop short squeeze
event. This analysis will test the event
against the efficient March market
hypothesis, evaluate behavioral
explanations, and assess whether the
observed anomalies constitute a true
failure of market efficiency.
A critical first step was to verify the
Simon's claim that GameStop traded at
0.04 in August 2020.
But a query of historical data found the
claim to be incorrect after adjusting
for the 2022 stock split. The actual low
in August 2020 was 1.04
and the lowest price in 2020 was 0.64 in
April. The squeeze pe in January 2021
was 10.75.
Our analysis will precede this verified
data.
For the represent stage, we know that
the analytical framework for this
investigation begins with a quantitive
data analysis using Python followed by a
qualitative interpretation. The code
plan involves four steps. Number one is
fetching and verifying historical price
data, which we just did. Number two is
plotting price and volume on a linear
scale to visualize the events magnitude.
Three is to plotting price on a log
logarithmic
skill to analyze the percentage based
buildup. And finally, four is plotting
the 20 and 50-day move moving averages
to empirically test the weak form uh
EMH.
The data will be used to test the three
forms of EMH. The weak four will be
assessed via the SMA momentum plot. The
semi- strong forum be assessed by
comparing the price action to publicly
available information such as the 140%
short interest and fundamental analysis
estimates. The event's public nature
makes the strong form test less
relevant. Finally, the analysis will
identify key behavioral biases and the
specific limits to arbitrage that allow
the anomaly to persist.
So the implement stage will basically be
the four steps we just described. Our
first one like explained before such uh
split adjusted data from Wi-Fi annex and
prints the verification of the key price
points confirming the discing
the define stage.
So after we rounding we can tell that um
the 0.04 is not correct. It's actually
supposed to be
well 1.64
and um it peak is supposed to be 1
12.75.
And then um we have a standard linear
scale um to show its magnitude. The
price action in January 2021 is so
extreme that it renders all preceding
history flat. Paling the events
anomalous scale and the complete
detachment from historical norms. So as
we can see it's all um normal until this
uh very abnormal peak. So from this we
can conclude that the event in 2021 is
just so abnormal that um it can be
picked out. Same with the volume and the
price.
A logarithmic scale plot is required to
analyze the percentage base buildup
which is hidden in the linear chart.
This view shows that the price
appreciation begin steadily late 2020
corresponding with public news like Ryan
Cohen stake.
This is 2020 and this is the 2021 peak
and it's logarithmic.
So we can see that he made a pretty good
option.
And then finally the plot cirical test
of the week for EMH shows a golden cross
around October to November of 2020 well
before the main spike. A strategy based
on the past price data will have yield
significant returns. Again this is like
a very good investment choice because it
just peaks off right after that.
So as a conclusion of the implement
stage, the analysis provides clear
verdicts on the EMH. The weak four was
violated as no momentum code block four
shows that past price data has had
predictive power. The semi strong form
was massively violated. The market
failed to incorporate public information
like 140% short interest for months and
then when it did react price completely
detached from all public fundamental
data.
This failure is explained by behavioral
factors including mass hurting via Wall
Street BS and narrative driven
investing.
The anomaly was sustained by severe
limits to arbitrage.
the risk of ruin for short sellers such
as Melman Capital, the astronomical cost
to borrow shares and the structural
failure of brokers restricting by orders
at the peak.
So now we can move on to the validate
stage after we um presented our
analysis.
So we have verified our finding by
several points. The sheer magnitude of
the event is a 10,000% price rise. It's
not it's not just a statistical noise,
but a clear significant anomaly.
Furthermore, the conclusions align with
the broad consensus from regulatory
bodies including the SE SEC and academic
researchers. The event is widely
accepted as a profound if temporary
breakdown of market deficiency
for the evolve stage.
We talked about our implications of the
analysis. It's very significant. The
event provides powerful real world
evidence for the behavioral finance
framework demonstrating that sentiment
and narrative can overwhelm fundamentals
for investment management. It highlights
the extreme risk of active strategies
in meme stocks while simultaneously
validating the risk mitigating benefits
of passive diversified indexing. The
event also served as a catalyst for
policy triggering congressional hearings
on market gamification payment for order
flow and short sale transparency.
In further reflect when I say that in
synthesis the GameStop short squeeze
demonstrated the boundaries of efficient
market hypothesis. The EMH models built
on the core assumptions of rational
actors and near zero limits to
arbitrage. The GME event show what
happens when both of those assumptions
fail simultaneously and spectacularly.
was a perfect storm where behavioral
dynamics amplified by social media
collected with a fragile market
structure. This allow price to detach
from fundamental reality creating a def
definitive case studying behavioral
finance and the very real limits of
arbitrage.",,0,1

",FALSE,1,"for hedge funds or short sellers. So that proved that being a fundamentally right isn't enough to be profitable. Melvin Capital was a really good example of this. This was a really pivotal part of the situation. Mel Melvin Capital was right technically that Jamie was overvalued but they were bankrupted by a risk that they couldn't model. So the concepts limit arbitrage is no longer theoretical but it's primary risk to be managed. Secondly, we want to evolve by evolving the financial theory. We want to look at EMH versus behavioral. So pure EMH like using pure EMH is kind of a failure. So we want to evolve to use not just AMH but also behavioral finance because the GM event is a catastrophic failure for the strong and semi- strong forms of the AMH proving that it's not consistently like valid or usable every time. So this brings us to the triumph of behavioral finance. It proves that these biases such as hurting, overconfidence and the disposition effect are not just small anomalies but can become the primary driver of price which overwhelms rational arbitrageers. So the evolve synthesis is that the J event doesn't mean we throw out the EMH but that we have to evolve it. We have to kind of look at how we can use in other situations or in similar situations how we can do a better job by not just using EMH as it is but to evolve it. So the modern and synthesized view is that markets are mostly efficient but are subject to brief violent and self-reinforcing behavior bubbles when limits to arbitrage are high. The GM event proved that behavioral finance is not a soft alternative to EMH but a necessary component of EMH to explain the real world. Finally, I want to reflect a little bit on what I learned. One thing that I learned a lot is to always validate. And we learned this a lot in the beginning. Um, it was a interesting thing to kind of try to validate from the beginning because I feel like that's something I hadn't been doing very well in previous assignments. But making sure to validate all of our numbers before we start the analysis is really important. Even if numbers are given to us or even if we think they're correct, is to double check and like as we validated in the beginning and found out that a claim is incorrect, we were able to use the correct numbers for the rest of our analysis. And then secondly, um, one thing I learned a lot is that EMH is not wrong. It is just incomplete. The market is not a perfect rational pricing machine, but a complex system that is mostly efficient. So that kind of goes back here to our evolve, our second part of evolve. I learned um, a lot about how um, and I feel like this can kind of translate well into other situations when it might not be that a process or system is completely wrong, but just you have to evolve it and change it. Just like in our example here that EMH is not wrong. It was just incomplete and needed a little bit of evolving. So I learned a lot through this project. Um I knew kind of about the situation with GameStop, but I didn't know a whole lot. So it's interesting to dive deeper into that. Just kind of to wrap up here again are the five things that we um did in our analysis with our goal being to test the efficient market hypothesis which we did by analyzing the GameStop short squeeze as a case study which we did for market anomalies and behavioral finance which we also studied those. So thanks for listening. Thank you.",,0,1
