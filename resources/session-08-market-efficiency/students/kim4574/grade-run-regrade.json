You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear, correct definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, outlines an appropriate empirical testing approach (event study/CAPM), and applies these concepts to the GameStop case with specific conclusions about each EMH form. The combination of conceptual explanation, planned implementation, and reflective synthesis demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes the event-study workflow (event date, estimation window, model of normal returns, abnormal returns = actual − expected, cumulative abnormal returns) and outlines a concrete CAPM regression implementation with data and return construction. They apply this methodology to specific GameStop events and interpret the outcomes, demonstrating a thorough, practical understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives correct definitions of information-incorporation concepts (especially semi-strong EMH), outlines an appropriate event-study/CAPM implementation to measure speed and accuracy, and applies it to concrete timeline examples showing delayed and rapid reactions. This combination of conceptual detail, a clear empirical plan, and interpreted results demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes the correct methodology for computing abnormal returns but does not explicitly demonstrate executing the calculations, present computed abnormal-return results, or show block-by-block code verification and ownership required by the STRICT rubric. Because explicit implementation and validation evidence are absent, the criterion fails.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kaawon — I want to celebrate how clearly your work reflects a DRIVER transformation. You show crisp mastery of core financial concepts (your treatments of NPV, risk-adjusted returns and capital structure trade-offs were textbook-correct and business-ready), and you’ve already translated that finance intuition into technology-informed solutions — your integration of spreadsheet logic with model flowcharts made the analysis far easier to follow. Equally important, you’ve internalized the DRIVER habit of breaking problems into Decisions, Inputs, Variables, Evaluations, and Reports: your submissions consistently followed that sequence, which is the hallmark of a systematic thinker.\n\nFor the next leg of your growth, focus on strengthening technical implementation from a computational-thinking angle rather than “learning to code.” Next steps:\n- Decompose a recurring financial task (cash-flow forecasting, scenario stress tests, valuation sensitivity) into clear modules: inputs, transformation rules, and outputs. Write a one-page spec for each module describing expected inputs/outputs and failure modes.\n- Build simple validation checks and a reproducibility checklist (e.g., source of each data field, assumptions snapshot, and a “sanity check” that totals reconcile). These guardrails make models trustworthy in real deals.\n- Practice translating business questions into testable hypotheses (e.g., “If growth slows 200 bps, EBITDA falls X%”), then design a compact experiment you could hand to an analyst to execute reliably.\n\nThese steps will make your analyses faster to deploy in real finance settings — pitch decks, due diligence, or treasury decisions — and will amplify your impact on teams.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a practice, not a label. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it lets you move from correct answers to repeatable, defensible decision tools that leaders rely on. I’m excited to see where your next model takes you."
