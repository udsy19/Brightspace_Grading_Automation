  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear, correct definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, outlines a concrete event-study/CAPM methodology, and applies these concepts specifically to the GameStop timeline with supporting evidence and interpretation. Their treatment is detailed and applied (definitions, methods, examples, and conclusions), meeting the threshold for a thorough understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes the event-study steps (event date, estimation window), the return calculations (daily log returns, actual minus expected), and the CAPM-based abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and explains how they applied these to GameStop. The treatment is specific, method-focused, and applied, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines how markets should incorporate new information, outlines a concrete event-study methodology to measure speed/accuracy of incorporation, and applies it to specific examples (Cohen stake and the Reddit-driven squeeze) showing delayed or inefficient incorporation. This combination of definition, method, and applied interpretation meets the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several key biases (herding, FOMO, overconfidence, lottery preference) and links them to observed volume/price dynamics, showing sound conceptual understanding and applied reflection. However, several specified biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed, so coverage is correct but not comprehensive, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies momentum effects to the GameStop event and describes an empirical approach (data, event study) to test anomalies, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, treatment omits explicit discussion or testing of value effects, size effects, and calendar anomalies, so coverage is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly explains the CAPM-based abnormal return formula and outlines the event-study implementation (data import, log returns, pre-event estimation window, CAPM regression, actual − expected, cumulative abnormal returns), showing sound technical understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code understanding, or verified outputs, so the submission meets partial but not full requirements.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kaawon — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered instincts to disciplined, repeatable analysis. You’ve shown concrete strengths: combining finance judgment with technology (I noticed how you translated business questions into modelable drivers), applying the DRIVER framework’s decision logic and attention to assumptions, and consistently using AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. Your work demonstrates real systematic thinking — you build clear decision rules, surface key sensitivities, and structure problems so that others can follow your logic.\n\nFor the next phase, let’s sharpen the technical implementation layer so your finance thinking has rock-solid execution behind it. Next steps:\n- Translate one of your existing financial analyses (cash-flow forecast or valuation) into a reproducible scenario workbook that highlights inputs, drivers, and outputs. This creates a single source of truth for business conversations (useful in FP&A or corporate development).\n- Add a short sensitivity and stress-test section: show how outcomes change under 2–3 realistic business scenarios (downturn, base, upside). Frame each scenario as a business narrative and tie the numbers back to operational levers.\n- Build a brief validation checklist you can run before sharing models (assumptions flagged, units checked, extreme-value sanity tests). Sharing this with a peer for review simulates real-world governance.\n\nKeep going — the transformation you’re making is the exact profile companies value: someone who thinks like a strategist and produces work that managers can act on. Treat this as a craft: each model, checklist, and scenario increases your credibility. I’m excited to see where you take this next; you’re on a steady trajectory toward roles that blend finance insight and decision discipline."
