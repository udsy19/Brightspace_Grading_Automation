  "transcript": "All right. Hello, my name is Kan and today I will be doing my management 310 session 8 assignment on the GameStop short squeeze. And I'll be using the driver framework in order to um go through this. I'll be going through a verbal explanation first and then kind of walking you through the some of the code that I use in the implementation process. And so first we're going to be defining the core question which is did the GameStop job short squeeze show that markets are inefficient or can it be kind of be taken as an anomaly and be reconciled with the efficient market hypothesis or EMH once we account for limits to arbitrage and behavioral biases. And so today we'll also be d um looking at some valid data and looking at what's valid and what are some things that have been going around that maybe are not um as well as market efficiency, rational profit opportunities and behavioral such micro micro structure biases like hurting social media dynamics and market plumbing um that would explain the price path without completely derailing the model itself. And so before I kind of go into um each financial concept in general terms, I'll be kind of defining it so that we can apply it to GameStop. And so first in the efficient market hypothesis, it says that markets incorporate the weak form of EMH, which is what I'll be referring it to as now on is that markets incorporate all past price volume price and volume information. um and it's that you can't systematically beat the market with using chart patterns, m momentum, reversal or technical analysis and that past returns can contain no exploitable predictive power once risk is accounted for. Um that's basically just saying you can't really predict the market. And then the second one would be semi- strong EMH, which is that markets incorporate all publicly available information and quickly with without bias. And it means that earnings announcements, short interest reports, analyst ratings, news, Reddit threads, those are all instantaneously reflected in prices and that there is no predictable drift or delayed reaction. And then the last one is a strong forth strong form EMH, which is that market markets incorporate all information public and private. And so it implicates that no insider or institutional investor should consistently earn abnormal returns if this is the case. And almost no one, even academics, take this sort of theory seriously. Um, an explanation of abnormal returns is that the portion of a stock's returns cannot be explained by normal risk factors such as the market, the beta, its usual volatility. Um, and the concept is that the abnormal return equals actual return minus the expected return from like the CAPM or market model that we looked at in the past. And if that abnormal return is really high, that's kind of what you're looking for. uh large repeated abnormal returns in a short window around certain information events means that there's a possible market inefficiency. And then some behavioral finance concepts uh hurting investors copy one another. Um they assume that they um the others know something. They fear of missing out. That's that FOMO aspect. And then they fear that they would be the only one who's wrong which is why hurting happens. Overconfidence. Exactly what it sounds like. They investors overestimate theirformational advantage or predictive skill. U FOMO. people chase assets with extremely skewed payoff distributions and that's also known as the lottery preference. And then narrative economics stories um it becames a coordinating device that moves capital and then there's limits to arbitrage. So even if a price is obviously wrong, rational traders may not correctly because of capital constraints, borrow availability for shorts, risk of unlimited losses, margin call short squeezes or liquidity evaporations. And then market microructure frictions are plumbing issues like clearing house collateral requirements, trading restrictions, bid as spread explosions or options gamma exposure. And these can cause large price dislocations even within fully rational investors. And so if we look at the rational investor profitability u a general explanation is that EMH allows temporary anomalies if they cannot be systematically exploited and risk adjusted returns disappear once you consider constraints. Um, so some things to ask are can investors uh design a repeatable strategy? Did X anti-information give a positive expected value? And were risks so large that abnormal profits were actually compensation for fundamental risk? And then um the event study methodology is you first identify an event date. Um, so for us it'd be like co-en stake disclosure the January 28th trading halt and then establish the estimation window before event to model normal returns and then compute abnormal returns like that actual minus expected that I kind of talked about in the equation before and then you sum the abnormal returns to compute the cumulative abnormal returns or C and large C is a possible violation of EM EMH and so today we're going to be applying all of those concepts to the GameStop timeline. So, near 2020, um they were near like bankruptcy levels, but there was this one uh statement that we were to validate and that was that in August 2020, GameStop was trading at 4 cents and that is completely false. I looked on Fidelity, Yahoo Finance, um and also just other sources that say that it was actually trading at around $1 to $2. Um it was at lowest about $1 in August 2020. And so, that statement is false. It was not 4 cents. Um however the fundamentals of GameStop were weak, revenue was declining, short sellers were dominant and then high uh short interest begins building and you should if you look at the image you would expect prices should reflect weak fundamentals and high bankruptcy risk which they did. And then in September 2020, Ryan Cohen acquires 13%. Um he's like the Chewy founder and he's a pretty credible operator and this is public information. And then there's a semi- strong em EMH expectation that price should adjust rapidly but not overreact to the news. Um and then the observed data which kind of follows this is that prices did rise gradually but not instantaneously and the cohen effect took weeks to fully reflect. Um there's a possible semi-strong inconsistency which is a delayed reaction. And then if you jump to January 2021, that's when there's a Reddit subgroup that u manually makes this stock surge to $483. Um the short interest is about $140 140% of float according to S3 partners. The retail volume increased about 10 times. The options activity created gamma squeezes and the stock surged from $20 to $483 in a very short period of time. Um, if you look at a weak form EMH violation, you would say momentum effects exploded and past price movements absolutely predicted future returns or at least short-term. And then a semi-strong EMH violation that public info, high short interest or WSB hype. Um, it took weeks or months to incorporate and that the price overshot analyst estimates by about 10 uh which were about $10 to $40. And then if you look at the strong EMH violation, hedge funds with sophisticated analytics were blown out um such as Melvin Capital which was which lost 53%. And this is evidence that markets do not absorb all information immediately or efficiently. And then if you look at um February 2021, there's congressional hearings, policy makers investigated market manipulation and broker restrictions. and then the trading volume was normalized and the volatility declined. So this is more like postmortem, but it does show that the system recognized that something unusual happens and took steps in order to kind of mitigate that anomaly that happened. Now we have a bit more stabilization. The price has reverted back to their fundamentals, the volatility and volume back to historical norms. And then Cohen later became chair which means that the business partially transformed. And then if you look at the that event the mean reversion consistent with EMH is that eventually prices do return to fundamentals but the severity of that deviation show that uh intraday or short-term prices can be wildly inefficient. So um if you look at the the test a week is basically the null hypothesis for that is that the GameStop pass prices do not allow prediction of future returns and then the reverse would be true for the um hypothesis that it g um GameStop shows momentum or reversal patterns inconsistent with weak form EMH and then um the other hypothesis for semi-strong and strong follow along the same patterns where the null hypothesis is that it is um that it follows along that specific EMH theory and then the other hypothesis is that it does not and so um the different event windows the coen stake was in September 2020 retail hype December to January peak squeeze was going to be January late January the halt and restriction on the 28th and then postevent stabilization would be February to March of that year of 20 of 2021 and then if you look at behavioral drivers. There was definitely hurting on social media that was present, overconfidence and FOMO. Um narratives as price catalyst, retail option buying u leading to a gammon squeeze and then arbitrage arbitrage limits. And so um if we look at everything the um if if you look at the um abnormal returns and event behaviors, we can see that um there was definitely some some uh there was like no predictability to this event which makes it absolutely abnormal. But if we look at other kind of behavioral biases, we kind of had to question whether this is a fundamental market failure or if this is um simply a a normal kind of anomaly of the market. And so um some like key takeaways from this is that the EMH works reasonably well in normal conditions but it breaks under extreme coordination and platform driven sentiment and behavioral dynamics are now essential for understanding price formation. Uh clearing and collateral mechanisms can drive price action more than fundamentals and regulatory frameworks need to consider transparency for short interest broker collateral requirements and the role of social media. Um, now I am going to show um a little script that I use collab in order to write. Um, and I'll just kind of be like walking through what that does. All right. All right. So if you can see my screen um first the notebook is going to import standard finance and data analysis libraries and download historical price for both GameStop and the S&P 500 proxy s and spy from August 2020 through mid 2021 which is that event window I was talking about. That is going to give us all the inputs we need to analyze the price levels trading volume and market broad market movements. and that's going to establish the foundation for checking whether or not GameStop's behavior align with what we would expect. Next, we're going to do a price analysis. And so, here we have the um the notebook is going to plot the GameStop's adjusted closing price over time. And it's going to create a visualization that shows the massive runup to the $483 peak followed by the collapse. And it's going to allow us to connect those price movements to the timeline of events. And then um you're going to see that market efficiency would normally imply smoother fundamentals uh fundamental acred pricing. And so a visualization of this would definitely not show that and it would have extreme deviations. And then from there the notebook is going to convert those raw prices into um daily raw log returns. And so, um, the returns are the basic unit of market efficiency testing, and we're going to use them to see whether or not GameStop earned abnormal returns that can't be explained by normal market risk. And then there's going to have a um estimation window and CAPM regression. And so, it's going to select a pre-event estimation window and then fit a simple CAPM style regression of GameStop's returns on SPY's returns. And so conceptually, this regression estimates um what GameStop's normal behavior would have been based on how sensitive it is to the market and what would have been expected on a typical day. And if markets were efficient, actual returns during this event would line up with the expected returns. And then uh we're going to look at the um so like using that regression you would see the expected returns the abnormal returns which is actual minus expected and then the cumulative abnormal returns which is just all of that added up and then it would complete a volume analysis here um which is going to plot the trading volume and a normalized volume measure. So, it's going to be comparing volume during the squeeze to pre-event norms. And the retail volume jumps more than 10 times. I'm just now realizing that I may not be sharing my screen. Um, which no, I am. My apologies. Um, not sure why I didn't think I was sharing for a second. And you're going to see that retail volume is going to jump more than 10 times. And you can align that with behavioral explanations such as hurting, FOMO, NATO driven trading, and social coordinations. So if you put it all together, um you can say prices deviated massively from levels justified by risk or fundamentals. There were abnormal returns during the squeeze which were enormous. Volume patterns highlight powerful behavioral dynamics and CAPM based expected returns completely failed during the event. This suggests for weak form EMH it failed due to extreme momentum and predictable reversals. The semi-strong EMH failed because there was public information that was not incorporated efficiently and behavioral finance plus limits to arbitrage best explain the price dynamics. Um those are the takeaways from the script. Thank you.",
