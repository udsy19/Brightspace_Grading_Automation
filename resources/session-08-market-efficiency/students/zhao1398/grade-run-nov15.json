  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies and tests all three EMH forms, provides specific empirical tests and examples (moving averages/golden cross, 140% short interest, public-fundamental mismatch), and reflects on structural/behavioral mechanisms that explain the outcomes. This is a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment meeting the standards for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student moves beyond basic calculations by verifying and correcting raw data (split adjustment), using log-scale visualization to reveal percentage buildup, applying SMA/golden‑cross momentum tests, and deriving substantive insights (predictive signals, short‑interest mismatch, behavioral and policy implications). Coverage is specific, applied, and tied to meaningful conclusions, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the problem and lays out a specific, actionable research design (data verification, visualization types, and explicit tests for weak vs. semi‑strong EMH), satisfying the STRICT requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration. The plan is concrete enough for replication and defense.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly outlines empirical tests relevant to event-study questions (data verification, plotting, SMA-based momentum checks, and comparing price moves to public information), showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not specify an event-study framework (estimation window, market model, abnormal-return calculation, or statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how and when public information (e.g., 140% short interest, Ryan Cohen stake) was reflected in prices and links delays to market frictions, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide quantified timing, formal event-study methodology, or statistical measures of speed/accuracy, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invokes behavioral explanations (notably herding/narrative-driven sentiment) and plans to identify biases, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not systematically name or analyze the full set of specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) with concrete examples or mechanisms, so the coverage is accurate but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sherry — I’m really pleased with how you’re adopting the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently break complex finance problems into clear steps, lay out the decision logic before you compute, and explain your assumptions so a non-technical stakeholder can follow your reasoning. In several assignments you transformed a fuzzy request into a repeatable procedure (identify drivers, map inputs to outputs, isolate sensitivities) — that’s exactly the systematic thinking we want to cultivate.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will make your analyses more reliable in business settings. First, tighten financial-concept accuracy by explicitly reconciling model outputs to underlying accounting mechanics: for any projected cash flow, show the income-statement, balance-sheet, and cash-flow linkages (depreciation schedules, working-capital drivers, tax timing). This prevents plausible-looking numbers that don’t stand up to scrutiny in FP&A or valuation work. Second, improve technical implementation robustness by adding quick validation checks and scenario tests: include reasonableness gates (e.g., margin caps), one-parameter sensitivity runs, and a short “sanity checklist” at the end of your write-up. These are low-effort changes that pay huge dividends when models are used in board decks or investor conversations.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a career habit, not just a classroom tool. The ability to structure an ambiguous business question, make transparent assumptions, and produce defensible results will distinguish you in roles from corporate finance to strategy.
