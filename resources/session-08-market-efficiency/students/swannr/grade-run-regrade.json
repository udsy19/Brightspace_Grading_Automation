  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH: they specified tests for each form, executed empirical analyses (autocorrelation and event studies), and interpreted results with robustness checks. DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Validate/Evolve) show structured methodology and credible evidence supporting the conclusions.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, listed concrete goals and success metrics, and identified data sources and an event timeline—meeting the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover articulation. The plan was framed clearly enough for a reviewer to understand the intended tests and data needs.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided an explicit, detailed plan for analyzing market efficiency—naming data sources, specific events, the market model and AR/CAR measures, and intended tests—fulfilling the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is sufficiently specific for a reviewer to understand and defend the proposed methodology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and applied the core event-study elements (market model, AR, CAR, event windows) and reported robustness checks, showing conceptual and some implementation competence. However, the submission lacks detailed methodological parameters (estimation window, model specification), explicit numeric AR/CAR results or statistical test details, and the student relied on AI-produced code without demonstrating line-by-line understanding—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied event-study concepts and interpreted a delayed, multi-week price response to the Cohen 13-D, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, the submission omits key methodological specifics and quantitative timing/statistical results (estimation windows, exact AR/CAR values, significance tests), so the treatment is sound but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student described and reported AR/CAR analyses and ran AI-assisted code, they explicitly stated they could not read the code and provided no methodological specifics (estimation window, model specification, numeric AR/CAR/statistics) or line-by-line explanations. Under the strict technical standard requiring explicit personal execution and understanding, this fails to demonstrate the required competence.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Ryan —\n\nI want to celebrate how thoroughly you’ve adopted the DRIVER way of thinking. Your submissions consistently show the DRIVER structure front-and-center: you break problems into clear objectives, identify the right drivers, and lay out which data and calculations will move the needle. Your written explanations are crisp and audience-ready — when you present an investment case you don’t just show numbers, you tell the causal story that a CFO or project sponsor needs to hear. That clarity and systematic decomposition are exactly the transformation I look for: you’ve moved from reactive “monkey-mind” answers to replicable, finance-first reasoning.\n\nNext steps to keep that momentum: sharpen a couple of finance and implementation practices so your analyses are both persuasive and audit-ready. For financial concepts, spend targeted time reconciling model outputs with basic accounting flows — map project cash flows to the income statement and balance sheet, and practice calculating WACC and NPV from first principles on a few real deals or company filings. Apply sensitivity and scenario analyses to the parts of the model that change decisions (price, volume, discount rate) and annotate which business levers each scenario represents — this will make your work directly usable in capital budgeting or FP&A conversations.\n\nOn the implementation side, add simple guardrails: an assumptions table, reasonableness checks (e.g., margins, growth rates vs. industry), and a short validation note summarizing key risks and how you tested them. These steps turn a great analysis into a replicable decision tool that business partners can trust.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a practice, not a one-off skill. The ability to translate messy business problems into a handful of causal drivers will open doors in corporate finance, strategy, and investor work. You’re on a strong trajectory — stay curious, iterate often, and lean on the framework (and your peers) as you tackle progressively bigger problems. I’m excited to see where you take this. — Prof. Zhang"
