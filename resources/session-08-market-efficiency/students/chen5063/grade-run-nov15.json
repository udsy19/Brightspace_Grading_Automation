  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and provides concrete GameStop examples and behavioral explanations for violations, supported by an event-study implementation and reflective discussion of limits to arbitrage. Coverage is conceptually thorough and applied, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student describes a complete event-study workflow (estimation window, CAPM normal returns, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns), implemented it via code, and validated results with statistical and economic significance tests. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology consistent with a PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly measures how quickly/accurately information was incorporated (estimation vs event windows, CAPM normal returns, daily and cumulative abnormal returns) and validates findings statistically and economically, then interprets them relative to EMH forms and arbitrage limits. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several relevant biases (anchoring, loss aversion, herding/momentum) to explain the GameStop event and ties these to empirical results, but did not address all required biases (overconfidence, mental accounting) and the discussion lacks comprehensive depth across the full list. This yields a correct but incomplete treatment → PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and provides empirical support for momentum and value anomalies (with event-study results and interpretation), but does not address size effects or calendar anomalies and lacks comprehensive cross-sectional or calendar-specific analysis. Coverage is accurate but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student describes the CAPM framework, estimation window, reports abnormal return results and a t-statistic, they do not demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block code understanding, or ownership (they state the code was generated by Google Gemini and provide no walkthrough or evidence they ran and verified it).

      "reasoning": "The student corrected a clear numerical error using a named external source and validated their own computed results statistically, demonstrating partial fulfillment of the verification requirement. However, they did not comprehensively verify or document all other numerical claims (e.g., analyst value ranges, peak price provenance, provenance of abnormal‑return inputs), so the verification task is incomplete → PARTIAL."

  "personalized_feedback": "Heidi — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve transformed your \"monkey mind\" into a methodical thinker. In your recent work you demonstrated hallmark DRIVER habits: you defined the decision problem tightly, laid out drivers and levers explicitly, converted assumptions into parametric inputs, and used scenario logic to show how outcomes change. Your write-up made the decision rule and value tradeoffs easy for a non-technical stakeholder to follow — that clarity is rare and powerful in finance.\n\nNow for the next step in your development: strengthen the technical implementation guardrail so your reasoning is always reproducible and auditable. Practical next steps:\n- Capture your model logic in a single, well-documented spreadsheet or template (one page of assumptions, one page of workings, one page of outputs). Label each driver and link it to the business line it affects.\n- Add simple sanity checks: totals that must equal, sign checks (cash flows that shouldn’t go negative without a flag), and a short “how to test this” note so others can validate changes quickly.\n- Translate one scenario into a one-slide decision memo showing the business impact (cash, margin, KPI) and recommended action — this bridges analysis to the boardroom.\n- Use AI as an assistant to generate test cases and to summarize sensitivity results, but keep the decision logic under your control.\n\nYou’re building a career skill — the ability to turn messy business problems into repeatable, defensible decisions. Treat this as an ongoing journey: each model you harden now will compound into clearer, faster decisions later. Keep going — I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next."
