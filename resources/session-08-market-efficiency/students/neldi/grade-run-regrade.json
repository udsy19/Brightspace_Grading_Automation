  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the market-efficiency testing objective, corrected input data, and enumerated testable hypotheses for weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, then mapped those to a concrete analytical plan. This satisfies the strict requirement to define and discover the testing problem.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, concrete plan for analyzing market efficiency (tools, benchmark, timeframe, specific visual tests tied to weak/semi/strong EMH) and described the intended outputs (two-panel price/volume chart). This explicit, actionable layout satisfies the strict requirement for a represent-stage plan.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student implemented a systematic workflow aligned to their Represent plan (data retrieval with YFinance/Pandas, defined tickers/timeframe, produced two-panel price/volume charts) and validated outputs. While higher-level (visual rather than full statistical tests), the execution follows an organized methodology and produced multiple, validated outputs, meeting the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies the weak and semi-strong forms with event-specific evidence and an implemented data check, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: the strong-form claim is only posed but not analyzed or supported, so the coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual awareness of event-study methods and abnormal-return analysis and implemented data retrieval and visual validation, but did not perform formal event-study calculations (estimation window, market model, abnormal returns, or statistical tests). This correct but incomplete treatment warrants PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and qualitatively assesses information incorporation (identifying a semi-strong form failure and relevant frictions) and implemented visual data analysis, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform quantitative timing tests (event-study/abnormal-return/statistical tests) to measure how quickly or accurately information was incorporated, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Nick — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from reactive problem-solving to a systematic DRIVER mindset. You consistently break complex finance questions into defined drivers, build clear logic guardrails, and use AI explicitly as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. Your recent assignments showed concrete strengths: crisp decomposition of value drivers, consistent use of sensitivity matrices, and thoughtful alignment of assumptions to business realities. Those are exactly the habits that turn “monkey mind” into reliable financial judgment.\n\nFor next steps, turn the progress areas into practice routines tied to real business work. One technical spot to sharpen: validate assumptions and edge cases more systematically. Before handing off a model or recommendation, run simple “sanity checks” — reverse-engineer implied growth rates, stress-test cash flow paths under extreme scenarios, and document which assumptions would change your recommendation. Translate the financial-concepts progress into business applications by building short-case exercises: prepare a two-page memo that uses a small scenario analysis (best/base/worst) to support a capital-allocation decision, or construct a sensitivity table that shows how valuation changes with WACC and terminal growth. For communication, practice one-paragraph executive summaries that state the driver, recommended action, and the one key sensitivity that could reverse your view.\n\nThis is a journey. Your shift to systematic thinking is the highest-return skill for a finance career — it reduces surprises, improves decisions, and scales across teams. Keep applying DRIVER deliberately: each model, memo, and meeting is another opportunity to refine your logic guardrails and judgment. I’m excited to see where you take this."
