  "transcript": "Hello. Today I will be presenting a financial analysis of the GameStop short squeeze event, as a case study in market efficiency. So, I'll of course be using the DRIVER method framework to guide this investigation, and we'll have a final reflection at the end and the event's implications for the financial theory. So, let's of course start off with the Discover and Design. So, in the first stage here, we're going to define the problem. So, let's skip down to here where our objective is to investigate uh GameStop event to determine if it violated the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and to identify behavioral, excuse me, the behavioral finance concepts at play and assess if any rational or systematic profit opportunities existed. Excuse me, my throat's very dry at the moment. Okay. The assessment first provides a critical first step to verify the claim that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. To test our due diligence. So, of course, we went back in time, and we show that this is not correct. In fact, the prompt's claim is not right. Um, and we verify that the actual split-adjusted trading range for GameSt- GameStop stock in August 2020 was from a low of four, sorry, $1.04 to a high of $1.67. So, over a dollar more than the prompt's claim. So, um, and to be clear, we're getting it from here and this timeline. There we go. Okay. So, for analysis to be valid, we must proceed using the uh corrected factual data. So, we will be using the real numbers instead of the one given in the prompt. So, there's some other key facts that we have to uh discover and define here. And uh the event in question, it was driven by a social media uh Reddit post on uh r/wallstreetbets um where that caused a price surge. And uh some key data here. So, the shorted interest peaked at 140% of the float. Analysis fundamental value was estimated at $10 to $40 and the price surged to a high of 483 in January of 2021. And I remember that. The uh key players were retail traders, uh Ryan Cohen, and hedge fund hedge funds like Melvin Capital. Melvin. Yeah. So, my analysis will be um designed to test all three forms of the market efficient market hypothesis. So, there's the weak form, where uh past price patterns, um like technical analysis, able to predict future prices? So, we're going to answer that question. Uh, semi-strong form, so did the price rationally reflect all public information like short interest data, Reddit posts, and uh analyst reports? And the strong form: Did any entry uh with private information profit? So, this is now that the discovery phase is complete that I went through the uh problem, the uh situation that we're tasked with, the uh we debunked the prompt's claim, and we verified that fact. We went through the event, the key data, and the key players. We also went through and defined efficient market hypothesis, its three forms, and how we're going to be breaking that down. So, now that we have fully discovered um and uh defined everything here, we're going to move on to the represent stage. Goodness, excuse me, I'm sorry. My uh throat is very dry. It's just the room is just anyway, the uh second stage is um Represent, where I'm going to plan the analytical approach. Type up. Uh this is the blueprint for my uh analysis here. So, the goal here is to visually and analytically compare the observed uh stock behavior, GameStock, the GameStop stock behavior to the uh predictions of the uh gosh, uh the efficient market hypothesis. Um, so we're going to use the YFinance library in Python to go through this. This is the ticker symbol, of course. And then Ticker 2. This is going to be uh our market benchmark, which is going to be the S&P 500. And the time frame. So, that verification from discover phase, and improve the data discrepancy. Then we're going to move on to the price and volume visualization. So, we're going to create a two-panel chart, the stock price, trading volume. The uh violation test in the weak, semi, and strong form. So, we're going to um, excuse me. We're going to um move on to analysis number four, which is the behavioral and profitability assessment, so the qualitative. So, we're going to use the uh data to discuss behavioral biases and uh limit trading restrictions, right? So, now that we've gone through how we're going to uh go through this, implement with this code. So, just going to quickly walk through here. Here's a bit of code, but uh anyway, we import like stated, YFinance, Pandas, And uh we define, remember our ticker symbols from before, the represent stage. We have that here. Okay, we have our time frame. All right. So, I ran and, this is a little sneak peek ahead. So, we first imported everything, okay? This is showing everything here. The um this is what I just went through on the doc. The data verification here. Find the lowest price, right? Okay. And so we come across this chart. This is our time frame, the adjusted uh close price, and the uh history of the stock price. So, to validate this, okay. So, sorry for that. The uh fourth stage here, we're going to validate. So, um, secondly, we're going to, oh my gosh. Falling apart today, I'm sorry. Did not get through this very smoothly. Secondly, let's go through the uh uh logically explain the output here. So, after walking through the code, running it through Colab, going through the chart, we're going to go through the output. We're going to see the uh low, stable price in 2020, the surge, and the correlations with the parabolic spike over uh $400. Um this visual output validates, that chart that we just witnessed, just saw, our uh uh analytical plan. The chart provides that clear uh visual evidence of market behavior dramatically deviating from a random walk. Excuse me. The price is not efficiently uh processing information. It's being driven by volume-fueled frenzy. And, you know, like that that uh more of that Reddit side than based on the numbers. And uh this output confirms our implement step, which was successful, and gives us the evidence that we need for our final analysis. So, all right. So, now, just to quickly recap, because I've been stumbling through, apologies. Um, we uh went through, we debunked the claim, we verified the claim, uh the fact that uh it was over a dollar more at its low and a high of 1 uh 67. Um, the event, I already described, won't go through that. We represented this um through uh what we were going to break down, implemented it through the code. All right. And then I walked through using, including the chart, we I walked through the uh code here. And um to evolve. So, this is like, does this make sense overall? So, yes, the output perfectly matches here because it follows with the story and the narrative of the event. Um and is there any better way? So, the disconnect between the stable 2020 price and the uh 2021 spike is automatically where we uh have to investigate because that's when this happened here in early part of the year. And two, is there a better way? Yes, the analysis is a high-level visual test. So, a more advanced like evolved analysis would do, would include like a uh running a uh weak form test, a quantitative version. So, we could run statistical tests for uh autocorrelation to uh quantify that GME's past returns were, in fact, predicting future returns. And uh with that spike, that's clearly not the case, but we would do that to display it. We would uh scrape the uh Wall Street uh bets posts information and uh formal event study, uh while difficult, we could still try, you know, to um plot the abnormal returns. However, in this extreme case, the volatility is so high that the model wouldn't really work. Um, so those are some theoretical um, you know, things that we could do to evolve this. Uh so it does, so yes, it makes sense. There is better ways, some better ways, some ways that are better than others. And uh we have uh some theoretical implications here. So, we have active versus passive. So, uh it shows that while markets are generally efficient, they're not always efficient. It highlights a rare, but, you know, significant failure here. Uh but it does not prove that uh active management is uh any better, better in, per se. Uh it proves that uh black swan events driven by mass coordination can occur. Um but the policy here is that, you know, the event evolved the market itself, leading directly to uh congressional hearings on the uh, you know, gamification of trading and the role of like payment for order flow. So, this confirms our analysis is sound and uh, you know, actually leads to deeper insight. Wow. It's really scratchy, I'm really sorry. Ah. So, onto the reflex stage. So, on market efficiency, the uh Game GameStock market event was a clear, large-scale violation of two forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The weak form violation. The event was driven by momentum and herding effect, amplified by social media. So, this is a pattern in price and volume data that directly contradicts the random walk theory. Semi-strong form violation was the second one, where the market price peaking at $483 became completely detached from all of the publicly available fundamental information and analyst estimates of $10 to $40, which is nowhere close to what the market price peaked at. Uh so, based on the company's actual performance. So, highly overvalued, highly overpriced. Uh this proves the market was not rationally uh processing the public information. Uh on behavioral finance versus uh, you know, uh EMH uh basis here, we got the um two biases: Uh we saw clear evidence of herding. So, this is mass buying uh coordinated on Reddit, and uh overconfidence uh retail investors believing that they could beat hedge funds, and uh loss aversion, uh short sellers holding losing positions and creating the squeeze. So, uh limits to arbitrage. The EMH assumes rational investors can correct mispricing. But here, arbitrage was limited because when brokers like Robinhood restricted buying, they uh prevented the market from functioning, allowing the uh anomaly to continue. Um on profitability, looking back, it's easy to say uh buying uh GameStop was profitable. But uh looking forward, it it it was not a systematic or rational opportunity. It was a high-risk gamble on a non-repeatable event. Like a black swan event, like I stated before, the rational investor would not have systematically predicted or could have exploited this, seen this as a pattern, as it uh required guessing the peak of of a social movement. So, for the final little reflection here, following the DRIVER framework um allowed me to systematically fumble through, sorry, uh the uh and conduct this investigation where I began uh discovering the problem and correcting the data, first off. And then representing a clear analytical plan, implementing that plan into code, and validated that uh using the chart. I uh evolved the findings to consider deeper implications, and the reflection is that the uh stock event does not kill the EMH, but it places a strong boundary on it. It demonstrates that in the modern era, uh social media can act as a coordination mechanism to amplify social biases, creating if profound, but temp if temporary, market inefficiencies that financial theories must now account for. All right, I hope that ended up being a little more clarifying. And thank you for watching. Hope you enjoyed. Let's...",
