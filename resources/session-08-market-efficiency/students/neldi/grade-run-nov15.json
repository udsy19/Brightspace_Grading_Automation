  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research question, corrected the data, and articulated a concrete analytical plan (data sources, benchmark, timeframe, visualization). They also stated they executed the implementation and validated results with visual output, satisfying the DRIVER Define & Discover requirements and meeting the strict demand for explicit demonstration of research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a clear, actionable framework for analyzing event efficiency (data source, benchmark, timeframe, price/volume visuals and planned tests) and tied it to the research question, then executed and validated visual outputs. That explicit planning + validation satisfies the Represent-stage requirements under the DRIVER strictness.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, organized workflow from problem definition through planning, data import, and visualization, producing validated outputs (two-panel price/volume charts) consistent with an event-study implementation. While quantitative event-study extensions were noted as future work, the implemented steps show a systematic execution of the planned methodology, satisfying the Implement-stage requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined all three EMH forms and applied concrete examples showing weak- and semi-strong–form failures (herding/momentum and price detachment from fundamentals), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for a full pass: the strong form was only mentioned as a question and not analyzed or evidenced, and empirical testing depth is limited, so the work is correct but not comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described event-study goals and referenced abnormal-return plotting and statistical tests, showing conceptual understanding. However, they only conducted high-level visual analysis and explicitly stated the formal event study/abnormal-return calculations were not performed, so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed information incorporation (especially semi-strong form) and used the GameStop example and visualizations to argue prices did not reflect public fundamentals quickly. However, they did not perform quantitative timing or formal event-study/abnormal-return calculations to measure how fast or accurately information was incorporated, so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

However, they did not explicitly verify or document all other numerical claims from the prompt (e.g., cited short-interest, analyst estimates) against sources in the transcript, so the requirement is only partially satisfied."

  "personalized_feedback": "Nick —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve moved from scattered approaches to a repeatable, business-ready way of thinking. You’ve embraced the DRIVER mindset: your problem decomposition is crisp, your hypotheses are explicit, and you consistently map financial logic to model outputs. In your recent work I noticed three concrete strengths: you frame questions so they tie directly to business decisions, you run scenario comparisons that reveal trade-offs, and your write-ups translate numbers into next-step recommendations that an FP&A manager could act on. Those are exactly the habits that turn “monkey minds” into reliable analysts.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Strengthen technical implementation by making assumptions and validation visible to stakeholders. Create an assumptions sheet tied to P&L and cash-flow line items so non-technical managers can see the levers.\n- Add focused sensitivity and stress tests to your scenarios. Show how key KPIs (EBITDA, cash runway, IRR) move when a 10–20% shock hits revenue or cost drivers—this directly informs pricing, hiring, or investment timing decisions.\n- Build a short validation checklist you run before presenting: inputs sourced/dated, edge cases checked, and a one-paragraph confidence statement about model limitations and next analyses needed. This raises trust in real meetings.\n\nKeep going. Systematic thinking is career currency in finance: it makes your recommendations repeatable, defensible, and fast to iterate. Treat this as an unfolding craft—each model, memo, and sensitivity run sharpens your judgment. I’m excited to see where you take these habits next; you’re building the thinking framework that leaders rely on."
