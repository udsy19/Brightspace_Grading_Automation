  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, lists clear research questions, and specifies data needs and methodological approach—satisfying strict DRIVER requirements for Define & Discover. Evidence shows a concrete, defensible problem statement and planned procedures, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan for analyzing market efficiency—identifying method (event study), specific metrics (AR, CAR, abnormal volume, Sharpe), data needs, and concrete outputs—meeting the strict DRIVER Represent requirements. Evidence shows an articulated workflow that a reviewer or stakeholder could follow, so this criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission shows a systematic, end-to-end implementation: a planned list of outputs, execution on real data in Google Colab, and verification of results (statistical testing and data integrity). Although the student acknowledged coding difficulties and AI assistance, the methodological workflow was followed and multiple analytic outputs produced, meeting the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the semi-strong EMH concept (testing whether public information was instantly priced) and runs an event-study implementation, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: discussion centers on semi-strong results with only cursory nods to weak/strong forms and limited depth or comparative analysis, so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and application of event-study methods (market model, abnormal returns/CAR, abnormal volume, statistical testing) and executed analysis on real data, meeting baseline requirements. However, treatment is not thorough or fully robust: implementation relied on mixed AI code, contains inconsistent numeric claims and limited methodological detail or diagnostics, so the work is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly targets information incorporation and applies appropriate tools (event study, abnormal returns, statistical tests) on real data, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth on timing diagnostics and robustness (mixed numeric claims, coding/data issues, limited detail on event windows/tests), so the work is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Colleen — I’m really pleased with how you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently translated messy prompts into disciplined problem statements, and your models showed the hallmark of systematic thinking: clear assumptions, traceable drivers, and reproducible logic. I noticed you routinely used “logic guardrails” to prevent circular calculations and structured scenario comparisons so decision levers (sales growth, margin, working capital) map directly to outputs — exactly the kind of computational thinking applied to finance we want.\n\nNext steps to build on that momentum:\n- Tighten financial-concept accuracy by habitually reconciling model outputs back to the core financial statements. For every forecast change ask: “Where does this hit the cash flow statement?” and perform a one-minute conservation-of-cash check. This reduces surprises in budgeting or M&A work.\n- Strengthen technical implementation by formalizing simple validation tests (e.g., balance sheet balances, sign checks, sensitivity thresholds). In business settings these tests save hours during audits and investor reviews.\n- Improve integration of finance and technology by linking your model drivers to business KPIs. Start with a single automated feed (sales or headcount) so your sensitivity work updates from real data — this is exactly how FP&A teams make rolling forecasts actionable.\n- Sharpen communication: craft a one-page executive summary that highlights the top three drivers, the plausible downside, and one recommended action. Attach an assumptions appendix so stakeholders can trust and interrogate your work quickly.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory from thoughtful analyst to strategic finance partner. Keep treating DRIVER as a practice, not a checklist — each project is another chance to tighten assumptions, automate a routine, and tell a clearer business story. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next."
