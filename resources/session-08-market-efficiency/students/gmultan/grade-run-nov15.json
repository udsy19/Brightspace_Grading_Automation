  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the testing problem and laid out a concrete research design (event windows, data source, and market-model/AR/CAR methodology). Those explicit statements satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit framework: defined event windows and dates, identified the data source, and specified the market-model/AR/CAR methodology with visual and regression outputs—satisfying the strict requirement for a quality Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, systematic event-study workflow—data sourcing, model estimation (alpha/beta), AR and CAR computation, visualizations, and volume analysis—producing multiple outputs and interpretations. While some granular methodological choices (e.g., exact estimation-window parameters) are not fully detailed, the implemented pipeline and results demonstrate sufficient systematic execution for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies EMH concepts, uses event-study evidence, and discusses information processing and limits to arbitrage—showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly define or distinguish the weak, semi-strong, and strong forms nor map specific evidence to each form, so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies core event-study elements (market model, alpha/beta, abnormal returns, CAR) and used data/code to produce results, showing conceptual competence. However, reporting lacks methodological detail and full statistical disclosure (e.g., estimation window choices, explicit t/p values and test procedures), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied an event-study approach and computed abnormal/CAR measures, and explicitly concluded markets absorbed information quickly—demonstrating correct conceptual application. However, the submission lacks thorough methodological detail and precise timing/statistical evidence showing exactly how quickly prices reflected specific news, so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive enough for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Gurpreet — I’ve really enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation this term. You’ve moved from fragmentary answers to a clear, repeatable approach: you break financial questions into drivers, map those drivers to data, and build analyses that trace back to the original business question. Concretely, your decomposition of the revenue model into price × volume × mix and your structured sensitivity table showed systematic thinking — you don’t just compute numbers, you explain which inputs move the needle and why. Your use of AI as an execution assistant to draft scenario descriptions and surface alternative assumptions was also thoughtful and effective.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will improve your business impact. First, tighten financial-concepts accuracy: when you translate assumptions into cash flows, explicitly document the timing (beginning vs. end of period), tax treatment, and working-capital effects. As a routine, run a simple check: do cumulative cash flows reconcile to the balance-sheet movements you’d expect? Second, strengthen technical implementation where it matters for decisions — add small validation steps to your models: sanity checks, edge-case scenarios, and a one-page “assumptions & risks” section that ties each assumption to the decision it affects. These changes will make your analyses actionable for FP&A, capital budgeting, or pricing calls.\n\nKeep this up. Systematic thinking — the DRIVER habit you’re building — is the differentiator between a competent analyst and a strategic finance partner. Treat this as a career-long refinement: iterate your templates, collect post-decision feedback, and you’ll continually shorten the path from data to high-quality business choices. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
