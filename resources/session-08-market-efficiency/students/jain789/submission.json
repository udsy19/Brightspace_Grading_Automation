  "transcript": "Hi everyone, this is session 8 assignment. In this assignment, we're going to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. Going to verify the accuracy of the stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency. So the defining the problem the core problem is to use GameStop short squeeze 2020 as a case study to test efficient market hypothesis. Goal one, verification. Critically verify all the stated facts, especially the claim. GameStop traded at 0.04 cents in August 2020. Correct any inaccuracies. Goal two, EMH testing. Um, determine which form of efficient market hypothesis, weak, semi- strong, or strong, were violated in the GME price behavior. Goal three explanations. Evalue if the observed price anomalies. The surge can be explained with the traditional EMH frameworks or behavior finance explanations are necessary. Goal four profitability assess the systematic profitability for a rational investor considering risk and market constraints limit to uh arbitrage initial discovery and critical fact checking the assignment hinges on the timeline and um key data points. The first and most critical steps is verifying the initial price claim. So the statement GME traded at U 4 cents in August 2020 is highly suspect as a stock trading that low would typically be dislisted or on the verge of total collapse which GME was not. The statement traded at 4 cents is incorrect. Accurate figures. The closing prices for GME in August 2020 were in the range of $14 to $167 adjusted for subsequent stock splits. The lowest closing price listed in the search results were $14 cents on August 3rd and August 7th, 2020. The correction should be documented clearly and respectfully. State the professor's claim, the actual data range and the his source historical stock data. Communication, you know, obviously use KIS's principle. My initial data verification shows the stated price is incorrect. Game stocks did not trade at 4 cents in August 2020. Historical closing prices for August 2020. Postsplit adjustment were between $14 and $167. This directly addresses the error without overly verbose justification at the start. The stage um involves process planning an analytical approach using required methods of event study methodology principle just for this unique case. This an analysis will follow uh ESM combined recordative analysis of behavioral factors. Step one event definition which define the event window for short squeeze you know weak to semi-trong um and define a pre-event window and an event window from January 1st to February 15, 2021 expected return. The goal is to calculate the normal expected return for GME. The EMH uh form is weak. Use market uh model capital asset pricing model with the market S&P 500 to eliminate alpha and beta. Abnormal return AR. Calculate the AR with this following formula. It is weak/ semi- strong and you're going to compare GME actual daily return to its actual expected return. Fourth is um C. some the daily ARS over the win. It's weak and semi- strong and it's a statistically significant car um suggested market anonymally and behavioral evaluation explain the source of anonymally semi- strong and qual qualitative assess public information. So now we're going to go over to our Python code that um code that Gemini did for us and we're going to run it to make sure first it um is goes through. Perfect. Now we're going to start to analyze. As you can see right here, first step is we're going to define the parameters and downloaded data. Critical fact verification. The driver step verified statement that GameStop traded at 0.04 cents in August 2020, which indeed is not true. Third is we're going to market model estimate estimation the R step. And then fourth right here uh AR abnormal return and c calculation define the event window calculate expected returns calculate AR calculate cumulative AR five is we're going to visualization and interpretation plotting the car and annotate key events interpretations based on the graph conclusion the stated price um of 4 cents is incorrect actual prices were in a dollar to $2 range pre-split adjusted you know you can see market model estimmentation um 319 2020 to 1231 2020 and you can see the abnormal return analysis from here um January 1st 2021 to January to sorry um February 15 2021 and right here you can see visualization interpretation we got a lovely graph for us GME cumulative abnormal return during short squeeze as you can see it's starting at 0.0 zero. Slowly in 2001 it was you know reached over one and then yeah as you can see here the green is squeeze peak the red line is RC announcement and the blue is c interpretation notes magnitude um the massive position C expected greater than one or less less than 100% log returns indicate highly significant abnormal performance emulations this systematic highly predictable abnormal return suggests the weak and semi- strong forms terms of EMH were violated as the price deviated drastically from fundamental value and prior information. Behavioral finance the deviation is attributed to collective hurting and limits of arbitrage allowing the anonymity to persist. Okay, as you can see here, we were able to get that code for us done and now the calculation even with the mock data clearly shows that the AR during the squeeze period was massive. The result the C for the window would be exceptionally large and positive around 70%. The existence of a statistically significant large C confirm that GME price action cannot be explained by normal market risk and movement classification. So as you can see right here we have more definitions like for example weak form prices reflect all historical price and trading data and it shows that it's violated and we can see evidence here. Semi-trong prices reflect all publicly available information. Yes, it's violated and in for strong form prices reflect all information public and private and is likely to be violated. Rational investor portfol profitability analysis. Could irrational investor have profited systematically? Um yes it was too risky um and constrained. Systematic profitability no returns were too volatile and the timing was unpredictable. Systematic profit was not possible. risk adjustment returns. Enormous returns would came with massive almost infinite risk. Uh risk adjusted return calculation would allow the X and expected reward for this level of volatility was poor. And then limits to arbitrage. This is key. The um rational arbitur would identify the mispricing. However, selling short to profit expected was blocked by transaction cost as availability, non-synchronous trading and liquidity micro structure. Behavioral finance explanation provides far better explanation for the GME anonymity than the standard EMH. Behavioral biases, there's hurting behavior, individuals followed actions on the group, employing the effect. There's confirmation bias and there's loss aversion. For example, there's also social media influence. Reddit served as a platform for information cascade and coordinated trading. And then market microsstructure issues. The high short return of 140% a float revealed a significant flaw in market theoretical implications. EMH you know the price should reflect on a fundamental value of 10 to $40. Behavioral finance markets are subject to noise sentiment and limit arbitrage. The GME short squeeze does not invalidate the EMA entirely, but it provides powerful um evidence that the strong and semi-strong forms of hypothesis can break down due to behavioral factors and market microructure limits, especially during u periods of extreme sentiment. Thank you so much for listening and hope you have a wonderful day.",
