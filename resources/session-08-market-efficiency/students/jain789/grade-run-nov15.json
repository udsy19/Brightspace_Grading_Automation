  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines weak/semi-strong/strong forms, applies an event-study framework (market model, AR/CAR, event windows), and interprets results in context of behavioral and market-microstructure limits. Coverage is specific, applied to the GME case, and includes methodological and reflective stages, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study approach: specifies estimation and event windows, chooses a market model/CAPM with S&P500, explains AR and CAR calculation, runs code and reports results, and interprets significance and limits. This applied, method-focused treatment is thorough enough under the moderate standard to meet PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines semi-strong efficiency, implements an event-study to measure abnormal returns (AR/CAR) around the event, and interprets large, persistent CAR (~70%) as evidence that public information was not quickly/accurately reflected, citing behavioral and microstructure reasons. This applied, methodical treatment is sufficiently thorough under the moderate standard to warrant PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and links several relevant biases (herding, confirmation bias, loss aversion) to the GME episode and integrates behavioral reasoning with the event-study. However, treatment is brief and omits explicit discussion of overconfidence, anchoring, and mental accounting, so the coverage is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student analyzes abnormal returns and behavioral causes for GME but never discusses or applies momentum effects, value effects, size effects, or calendar anomalies specifically. Because the required anomaly categories are missing from the analysis, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student states the CAPM/event-study framework and ran code, but explicitly credits an AI (\"Gemini\") for the code and provides no personal, block-by-block explanation or ownership of the implementation and verification steps. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of personal execution and detailed code understanding, the submission fails.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sid — I’m genuinely pleased with how you’ve moved from scattershot problem-solving to a much more systematic thinker. Your explanations are consistently clear: you break down valuation steps into distinct logical pieces, you label assumptions so they’re easy to audit, and you translate technical ideas into plain business terms. That clarity is exactly what DRIVER aims for — your “monkey mind” is becoming a dependable process.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on tightening two practical areas so your analyses map more directly onto business decisions. First, sharpen financial-concept accuracy by treating assumptions as testable hypotheses: when you set a growth rate or discount rate, document the market evidence (comps, macro drivers) and run a quick sensitivity table (± two scenarios). That habit prevents subtle errors when moving from a textbook formula to a live deal. Second, improve technical implementation by adding simple reconciliation checks to every model: ensure cashflow, balance sheet, and P&L movements tie out and build one or two guardrail tests (e.g., debt balances never negative, working capital changes consistent with revenue). These are small steps with big payoff in credibility during stakeholder reviews.\n\nKeep treating the code or spreadsheet as a logic guardrail and let AI be your execution assistant — use it to generate test cases, produce scenario labels, or draft short memos that explain business implications. This journey matters for your career: disciplined, audit-ready thinking is what turns good analysts into trusted finance leaders. Stay curious, iterate on the processes you’ve begun, and I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
