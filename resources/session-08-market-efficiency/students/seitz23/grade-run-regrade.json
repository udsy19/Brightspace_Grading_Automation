  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives explicit definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applies them concretely to GameStop with quantitative comparisons and rule-based flags, and demonstrates sensitivity analysis via the implemented tool. This constitutes a thorough, applied conceptual treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem and described a concrete research design (event timeline, key prices, EMH frameworks), satisfying the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration. The statements show direct alignment with DRIVER Discover and Represent stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission provides a clear, explicit plan for analyzing market efficiency: chosen frameworks, specific data/metrics (timeline, key prices, returns, analyst ranges), and rule-based decision logic plus an implementation pathway. This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit Represent-stage plan.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and implements a simple, parameterized event-study approach and computes basic returns, showing conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks thorough event-study details (benchmark/model for abnormal returns, estimation window, cumulative abnormal return calculation, and statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and applies an event-timeline approach, computing returns and identifying apparent violations, so the work shows meaningful engagement with information-incorporation ideas. However, it lacks thorough event-study methodology detail (benchmark model for abnormal returns, estimation window, timing/announcement granularity, and statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student describes an event-study and a script that computes returns, there is no explicit demonstration of abnormal-return calculations (no benchmark/expected-return model, estimation window, AR/CAR computation, or statistical testing) nor block-by-block code explanation or ownership required by the strict standard. Therefore the criterion is not met.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Derek — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER mindset. From the way you consistently structure problems into Drivers, Inputs, and Resulting Effects, to the disciplined way you document assumptions before modeling, you’ve moved from ad hoc intuition to repeatable, teachable processes. Your scenario comparisons and use of clear decision rules show real progress in turning “monkey mind” impulses into systematic financial thinking that a CFO or product manager can trust.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two concrete areas that will pay immediate business dividends. First, deepen the technical validation of your models: add simple reconciliation checks (e.g., flow-to-stock consistency, balance-sheet parity) and targeted edge-case tests so outputs are robust when assumptions shift. That will make your work actionable in live finance settings — for example, when a capital-budget request is reviewed under stress scenarios. Second, build stronger bridges between your financial logic and business storytelling: translate key model sensitivities into stakeholder-ready metrics (breakeven months, marginal contribution per customer, cash runway under three scenarios). This helps turn your systematic outputs into decisive input for pricing, investment, or hiring decisions.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a career skill, not just coursework. The habit of decomposing problems, making assumptions explicit, and validating outcomes is exactly what differentiates someone who can “do the math” from someone who can drive business choices under uncertainty. This is a journey — your current toolkit already positions you to influence product and capital decisions. Continue iterating: small improvements to validation and communication will amplify the impact of your ideas. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next."
