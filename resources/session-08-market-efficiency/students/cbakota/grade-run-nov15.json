  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains weak, semi-strong, and strong form claims and applies them to concrete facts (140% short interest, divergence from fundamentals, retail coordination). They supported the conceptual discussion with an implemented event-study and broader reflection on arbitrage and behavioral factors, meeting the threshold for a thorough, applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly described and executed an event-study workflow (data fetch, market-model OLS, AR/CAR calculation, plotting) and reported concrete regression coefficients and statistical test results with interpretation. They also reflected on limitations (timing, significance) and linked findings to broader conclusions, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly addresses how quickly markets incorporated public information (semi-strong inefficiency due to 140% short interest not being priced), implemented an event-study with reported coefficients and significance tests, and reflected on structural/behavioral causes (broker halts, noise traders). This combination of conceptual explanation, empirical implementation, and interpretation meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides accurate, applied discussion of several key biases (herding, confirmation bias/“diamond hands”, overconfidence) with concrete examples tied to the event and empirical work, showing clear understanding. However, important items from the criterion (explicit treatment of anchoring, loss aversion, and mental accounting) are missing or only implicit, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly treats momentum and value-related anomalies and implements empirical tests (event-study, abnormal returns), showing applied understanding. Coverage of size effects and calendar anomalies is weak or absent, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding a PARTIAL score.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly implemented an event-study workflow (market-model OLS, AR/CAR calculations) and reported concrete regression outputs, showing personal execution of abnormal-return calculations. However, they did not explicitly demonstrate the CAPM implementation (no mention of risk-free rate or excess returns) nor provide the required block-by-block code explanation or methodological walkthrough demanded by the strict rubric, so the work earns partial credit.",

Reporting of estimation choices, coefficients, and hypothesis-test outcomes, along with plotted evidence and substantive interpretation, demonstrates a thorough and logically organized presentation of empirical evidence."

  "personalized_feedback": "Connor —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve been communicating and explaining finance problems. Your explanations consistently translate messy business questions into crisp DRIVER-style logic: you identify the decision, lay out the relevant information, and walk through the reasoning step-by-step so a non-technical stakeholder could follow. That is a core transformation from “monkey mind” reactions to systematic thinking — you now organize ambiguity into reproducible decision processes, and that’s exactly what we aim for.\n\nFor the next steps in your technical implementation growth, treat the work as strengthening the model’s guardrails rather than “coding improvement.” Practical, business-focused actions you can take:\n- Build an assumption map for one project (inputs, data sources, confidence level). Use it in a short memo to senior management so they can see what matters most.\n- Convert a valuation or budget into three scenario runs (base/optimistic/downside) and produce a one-page sensitivity table showing which inputs move NPV/IRR most.\n- Create a checklist of model sanity checks (balance continuity, unit consistency, shock tests). Run those checks and annotate failures with business implications.\n- Frame a small exercise as a decision brief: present the decision, show the model outputs, and list the top two risks and mitigations.\n\nThese tasks tie technical habits directly to business outcomes—better decisions, clearer audits, faster executive buy-in.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory where systematic thinking becomes your competitive advantage: it makes you faster, more defensible, and more persuasive in finance roles. Keep treating models as logic guardrails and the DRIVER lens as your compass. This is a long, rewarding journey—keep iterating, and I’ll be here to guide the next steps."
