Their DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT workflow demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student describes and implements core event-study steps (data collection, market-model OLS, abnormal-return and CAR calculation), reports parameter estimates and hypothesis-test results, and interprets statistical significance and practical limits—meeting the thorough, applied standard required for PASS. Minor wording issues do not undermine the demonstrated methodological competence.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains and evidences that public information was not quickly or accurately reflected (140% short interest, divergence from fundamentals) and supports this with implemented analysis and concrete examples of market frictions (broker restrictions, T+2 collateral). Their DISCOVER→IMPLEMENT→REFLECT workflow and specific case examples demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of information incorporation consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations, implemented a market-model regression, and reported alpha/beta, CAR-related statistics and p-values, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, clear statements of personally running/verifying each code block, or detailed ownership of the implementation required by the STRICT technical standard, so the submission is PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Connor — I’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You consistently translated core finance concepts into precise, actionable analyses: your valuation logic was clear (drivers → assumptions → valuation linkage), your treatment of risk and return showed sound theoretical grasp, and you merged financial intuition with tools in a way that made your conclusions defendable. Equally important, you followed the DRIVER sequence every time — your problem decomposition, assumption discipline, and communication of trade-offs demonstrate the shift from “monkey mind” reactions to systematic thinking.\n\nNext steps to accelerate your impact: focus your technical implementation on business-facing guardrails rather than programming for its own sake. Concretely:\n- Add rapid validation checks to every model: balance checks, unit checks, and a brief “what would break this result?” sensitivity table. These short routines turn models into reliable decision tools for managers.\n- Practice scenario design tied to stakeholder decisions: build 2–3 invest/avoid scenarios (base, upside, downside) and link each to a recommended action (delay, scale, hedge). That converts analysis into boardroom-ready options.\n- Create a one-page assumptions log and an audit trail for key inputs. Executives and auditors value traceable reasoning as much as the final number.\n\nKeep pushing this iterative approach—treat each model as a prototype you’ll refine with new data and questions. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it lets you move from answering “what is the number?” to guiding “what should we do?” I’m excited to see how you apply these practices to real deals and financial strategy. If you want, bring one of your models to office hours and we’ll sketch a practical validation checklist together."
