  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and tests weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, specifying empirical tests (event study, CAPM, t-tests) and reporting significant abnormal returns that support a semi-strong violation. Coverage includes timeline, data/method, results, and behavioral interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission presents a complete event-study workflow (estimation/event windows, CAPM expected returns, AR/CAR calculations, statistical testing) and describes data sourcing and implementation in Python, with reported results and interpretation. That depth and linkage across DRIVER stages meets the PASS standard for methodological understanding and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly links specific public news (e.g., Ryan Cohen stake, short interest, trading restrictions) to tests of semi-strong efficiency and implements a complete event-study framework (windows, CAPM expected returns, AR/CAR, t-tests). Results are interpreted quantitatively (significant CAR) and qualitatively (limits to arbitrage), providing the depth and application required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and illustrates several key biases (availability/herding, overconfidence, anchoring) and ties them to the GME episode, showing conceptual understanding and DRIVER-aligned reflection. However, the treatment omits explicit discussion of loss aversion and mental accounting and remains qualitative without deeper examples or behavioral measurement, so coverage is incomplete and rates PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links momentum strategies to the GME episode and implements an event-study framework, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment of market anomalies is incomplete: value, size, and calendar effects are not analyzed or discussed in depth, so the coverage is correct but partial.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates the full CAPM event-study workflow conceptually, reports numeric alpha/beta and CAR results, and states they validated outputs, so technical intent and partial execution are evident. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanations or clear first-person run/verification steps (e.g., \"I ran X function and confirmed Y\"), so requirements for a full PASS are not met.",

In your work I saw a disciplined flow from defining the business question to identifying relevant data, and you consistently used logical guardrails to justify each modeling choice. Your assumptions were stated rather than hidden, and your scenario structure showed real progress toward turning “monkey mind” impulses into repeatable analysis — that kind of systematic thinking is exactly what separates ad-hoc answers from useful financial tools.\n\nFor the next steps, let’s turn that structure into stronger business impact. On technical implementation you’ve begun to show progress; focus next on validating key assumptions with simple stress tests and sensitivity tables so you (and stakeholders) can see which inputs drive outcomes — e.g., run a 3-scenario cash-flow sensitivity to interest rate, sales growth, and margin. For integration of finance and technology, deepen the link between model outputs and decision levers: translate forecast differences into clear actions (adjust capex timing, tighten working capital, or change pricing) and build one-slide decision rules that managers can use. Practically, that means mapping model outputs to KPI thresholds and drafting short “if/then” implementation notes for each scenario.\n\nKeep going — your systematic approach is a career multiplier. In FP&A, corporate development, or product finance, the ability to frame questions, guard logic, and produce decision-ready recommendations is rare and valuable. Treat this as an iterative practice: each model you build should be easier to explain, faster to test, and clearer for decision-makers. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
