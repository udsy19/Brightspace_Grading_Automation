  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defined abnormal returns (AR) and cumulative AR, implemented an event‑study workflow (windows, CAPM, t‑tests) and produced/interpreted numeric results using Python data—demonstrating both technical integration and financial reasoning. They also provided plausible behavioral and limits‑to‑arbitrage explanations for why abnormal returns persisted, meeting the criterion's requirement for thorough explanation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the Define & Discover objective, performed fact verification (correcting the August 2020 price), and produced a detailed event timeline tying events to the market‑efficiency question—meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit plan for analyzing market efficiency—specified methodology (event study), model (CAPM), precise estimation and event windows, metrics (AR/CAR) and hypothesis test—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and tested weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and implemented an event-study (Represent/Implement), providing specific results that support a semi-strong violation. However, the treatment contains conceptual confusion (notably the weak-form explanation) and lacks equally rigorous justification for the strong-form claim, so the coverage is correct but not fully thorough—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and applied the core components of an event study (windows, CAPM, AR/CAR, t-test) and implemented data retrieval and modeling (Represent/Implement), showing clear conceptual ability. However, the treatment omits important methodological rigor (no discussion of model selection justification, autocorrelation/aggregation issues, cross-sectional inference, or robustness checks) and shows some implausible numeric outputs and slightly confused framing of weak/strong tests, so the work is correct but not thoroughly rigorous—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed information incorporation as a semi‑strong test, implemented an event‑study (windows, CAPM, AR/CAR, t‑test) and used public events to assess whether prices adjusted to new information. However, the analysis stops at a high level—it lacks explicit timing/speed analysis (e.g., intraday or lead/lag tests), robustness checks, and deeper treatment of accuracy metrics—so the understanding is correct but not thoroughly demonstrated.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Priya — I’m really impressed by how you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. You didn’t just apply tools; you structured the problem: defining clear objectives, isolating revenue and cost drivers, and iterating until your conclusions aligned with the evidence. Your work showed a strong bridge between finance and technology — you used data and simple automation to test financial hypotheses rather than letting tools dictate the analysis. That shift from “monkey mind” intuition to a reproducible decision process is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nFor next steps, focus on turning the progress you’ve made in financial concepts into airtight business-ready analyses. Concretely:\n- Strengthen model assumptions by explicitly documenting which drivers are forecasted vs. fixed, then run sensitivity and scenario analyses (best/worst/base) to show how outcomes change under realistic business shocks.\n- Tie your projections back to cash flow and financing: include a short working capital and capex schedule so your profitability story informs liquidity and capital needs — the kinds of outputs CFOs and investors ask for.\n- Improve technical reproducibility without overemphasizing code: make a one-page “logic map” that traces inputs → calculations → outputs and include a brief checklist for validation (sanity checks, outlier handling, key formulas).\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a professional habit, not an assignment format. Employers value someone who can decompose a business question, build simple checks, and communicate the implications for decisions like pricing, investment, or fundraising. You’re on a trajectory to be that person. Keep iterating, seek feedback from non-technical stakeholders, and lean on small, repeatable experiments to grow your confidence. I’m excited to see where you take this next. — Prof. Zhang"
