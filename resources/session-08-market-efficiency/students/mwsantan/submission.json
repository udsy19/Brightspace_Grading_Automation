  "transcript": "so this task is to analyze the 2020 to 2021 GameStop short squeeze using the DRIVER framework and of course the KISS method to study market efficiency in behavioral finance. So to start with the video—the Define stage—just like I said, I want to see if markets always reflect all available information like the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) says, or if investor behavior, emotion, and social media can cause major price swings. I will be using the DRIVER framework to keep everything simple and focused and help me keep track of what I'm getting. So to Represent the stage, I planned out how to collect and show my data. I used the Y-Finance library in Python along with Gemini to pull real GameStop price data from late 2020 to 2021. This gives the actual historical numbers, which you can see right here. I like my graphs and tables to see the numbers—it helps me better understand what I'm looking at. I also used a simple return formula, which is R = (P1 – P0) / P0, to measure how much the stock price changed over time. That helps me identify abnormal returns that might not match normal market behavior. As you can see in the tables here, these numbers from the dates give a clearer view of what happened during the short squeeze period. For the Implement stage, I created one clear graph to help me understand GameStop's closing prices. You can see that prices stayed low for most of 2020 but spiked sharply at the beginning of 2021, which I found pretty interesting, before slowly dropping again—but still staying higher compared to 2020. That visual shows the short squeeze and the volatility that made this event so famous. It's a simple but powerful way to capture how extreme investor reactions can look in data. The analysis of GME's price movement relates to the weak form of EMH. The weak form states that future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing past or historical data. Based on the visual, I looked at whether the price behavior observed is consistent with each form of EMH. Gemini provided the analyses, which helped me understand and implement the data pulled. Here I compared what I saw in the graph to the three forms of EMH—weak, semi-strong, and strong. The GameStop surge clearly broke from what the EMH would predict. Public information didn't justify that kind of price jump, so this event doesn't fit the semi-strong or strong forms of efficiency. It shows that markets can behave irrationally when emotions and group behavior take over, which you can clearly see in the data. It's really interesting to see this on a graph and table because it's one thing to read about it online, but another to actually see how the numbers were affected. For the Evolve stage, I looked at why this happened. Behavioral finance helps explain it—especially herding, FOMO, and overconfidence. Social media platforms like Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok amplified these effects and encouraged mass buying, which caused rapid price movements. This shows how human behavior and communication can strongly influence short-term market movements, even when fundamentals don't change. That happens every day—even I've seen things online that make me want to invest in something trending. For the Reflect stage, I summarized what I learned: online human behavior can influence investing decisions. This project taught me that markets are not always perfectly efficient—they're made up of people, and people act emotionally, even myself. By using the DRIVER framework, I stayed organized and moved step-by-step through defining, analyzing, and interpreting the data. Using Gemini helped simplify the process and provided tables showing price, close, high, low, open, and volume numbers with corresponding dates. The tables really helped me most—I could see how the numbers from early 2020 instantly spiked in 2021, which is pretty accurate when you think about how social media triggers FOMO and emotional investing. One key takeaway is that real markets are shaped by both information and human behavior. My summary is that I collected GME price data for 2020 to 2021 with no missing values. The price visualization clearly shows dramatic volatility during the short squeeze. The GME short squeeze significantly challenges the semi-strong and strong forms of EMH, as the movement was driven by social media sentiment and coordinated retail activity rather than intrinsic value or public/private information. Key behavioral finance factors included herding behavior, overconfidence, availability bias, and FOMO. These created a feedback loop that collectively drove extreme price movements, as shown in the data. For future research, one could quantify the correlation between social media activity on platforms like Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok and GME's price movements to better understand behavioral impacts. Overall, this assignment showed me that combining financial theory with behavioral insights gives a more realistic view of how markets actually trade. So yeah—thank you.",
