  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and explicitly applied each to the GameStop case with concrete examples (price data, return scenarios, social-media impact). Their work shows conceptual depth, data-based implementation, and reflection tying observations to EMH forms, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market‑efficiency testing problem, stated objectives and concrete research questions, and outlined the data/tools to be used—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit plan: scope/timeframe, research questions, data points to collect, and tooling (Colab and libraries), plus planned analyses (price verification, return scenarios, sensitivity analyses, explanation scorecard). This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly gathered data and computed simple event returns and applied EMH concepts, showing conceptual understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, they did not perform a formal event‑study: no benchmark/market model, estimation window, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical testing were reported, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed information‑incorporation questions and used data to argue that public/news information did not fully explain price moves (conceptual understanding). However, they did not perform a formal timing analysis (e.g., event windows, market‑model/benchmark returns, intraday reaction or statistical tests) to quantify how quickly and accurately markets incorporated new information, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed raw return scenarios and described using a notebook, but provided no explicit abnormal‑return methodology (no benchmark/market model, estimation/event windows, CAR calculations, statistical tests, or block‑by‑block code explanation). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration and ownership of abnormal‑return calculations, the submission fails to meet the criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Om —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER framework. You consistently set a clear problem statement, broke complex finance questions into logical sub‑tasks, and used guardrails to keep your reasoning disciplined — that’s exactly the shift from “monkey mind” to systematic thinker I want to see. Your use of AI as an execution assistant (prompting for checks, not answers) and your habit of documenting assumptions made your work reproducible and easy to audit — a concrete strength any finance team will value.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas where growth will pay immediate business dividends:\n- Strengthen technical implementation reliability: add lightweight validation checks (e.g., accounting identities, non‑negative cash flows, consistency between schedules) and simple scenario tests so your models fail loudly on bad inputs. In FP&A or valuation work, these checks prevent costly misinterpretations when data changes.\n- Deepen applied financial accuracy with business context: practice building one full end‑to‑end model (cash flow forecasting → DCF → sensitivity table) for a real company or a realistic case. Explicitly annotate how each assumption maps to a business driver (price, volume, margin, working capital) and run stress cases that reflect operational shocks. That links your systematic steps to real decision-making.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a habit: Define precisely, Investigate assumptions, Run guarded experiments, Verify results, Execute with clarity, Reflect on what changed. That disciplined lens is what separates analysts who produce usable insight from those who just produce spreadsheets. You’re on a strong trajectory — stay curious, keep stress‑testing your logic, and you’ll find these skills open doors in corporate finance, investing, and strategy. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
