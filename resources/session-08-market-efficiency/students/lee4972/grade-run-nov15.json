  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, standard event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, CAPM market model, abnormal returns/CAR) and documents implementation with real data and code tools, plus validation of results. Coverage is specific and applied to multiple events, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly tests information incorporation using a standard event-study framework (estimation/event windows, CAPM, abnormal returns/CAR) across multiple events and documents implementation and validation with real data. Their findings explicitly describe rapid price spikes and quick reversals, linking those observations to semi-strong inefficiency and providing a thorough applied assessment of how quickly and accurately markets reflected new information.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student goes beyond basic return calculations by combining CAPM-based abnormal-return analysis with rolling volume Z-score detection, multi-event CAR plotting, and interpretation linking empirical patterns to behavior and market structure. Multiple data-driven measures and event-level applications provide robust, applied insights that satisfy the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and applies a suitable empirical approach (event study/CAPM) to assess semi-strong efficiency, with clear implementation and validation. However, treatment is unbalanced: weak and strong forms are only defined, not empirically examined or discussed in depth, so the coverage is correct but incomplete — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and links several key biases (herding, overconfidence, loss aversion) and supports them with empirical signals (volume spikes, CARs), but treatment is brief and incomplete: anchoring and mental accounting are not addressed and the behavioral discussion lacks deeper, multi-faceted examples or quantification. Therefore the work shows correct understanding but not the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission applies an event-study to a single-stock episode but does not discuss or test standard market anomalies (momentum, value, size, or calendar effects) nor perform cross-sectional or factor-based analyses required to evaluate them. Because the criterion asks specifically about those anomalies and they are missing from both discussion and empirical tests, the work fails this criterion.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly checked a prominent numeric claim against historical data and documented the discrepancy, showing good practice. However, they did not demonstrate systematic verification of all numerical claims (e.g., other stated figures or counts) or present a comprehensive checklist of verifications, so the work is correct but incomplete — PARTIAL."

  "personalized_feedback": "Jaime — I’m really impressed by how you’ve begun to think like a finance professional who uses technology thoughtfully. You clearly integrated finance and technology: your model linked business drivers (revenue per unit, customer churn) to financial outcomes, and you used data inputs to make those linkages explicit. That clarity — mapping operational metrics to P&L and cash-flow effects — is exactly the systematic thinking we want: you’re turning messy intuition into repeatable decision logic.\n\nNow let’s turn that momentum into tighter financial accuracy and more consistent DRIVER practice. Next steps:\n- Tighten core definitions: when you project EBITDA, explicitly reconcile which line items flow into it (revenues, COGS, operating expenses, non-cash items). In practice, CFOs use these reconciliations to justify forecasts to investors.\n- Build simple validation checks into your models: add a cash-flow reconciliation and a break-even/sensitivity table so you can quickly spot implausible outputs. This mirrors how finance teams stress-test scenarios for board-level decisions.\n- Strengthen the DRIVER sequence: before modeling, write a one-paragraph problem statement with assumptions and success metrics; after modeling, summarize the decision recommendation in business terms (e.g., “Invest if NPV > X and payback < Y months”). That discipline makes your analysis actionable for managers.\n- Use scenario analysis routinely: translate optimistic/base/pessimistic operational scenarios into decision triggers used in budgeting and capital allocation.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution partners while you focus on clear logic and business questions. Your ability to connect operational metrics to financial outcomes is a rare strength — refine the financial tidy-up and communication steps, and you’ll move from a solid modeller to a trusted finance decision partner. This is a journey; I’m excited to see where your next iteration takes you."
