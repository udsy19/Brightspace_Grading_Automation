They interpret results directly in EMH terms (concluding semi-strong inefficiency) and link to behavioral/structural factors, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specifies concrete event-study parameters (120-day estimation, 20-day event window), uses appropriate data preparation (log returns, trading-day alignment), fits a CAPM to derive expected returns, and evaluates CAR—demonstrating a thorough, applied implementation of event-study and abnormal-return testing that satisfies PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specifies concrete event-study timing, computes abnormal returns/CAR and volume measures, and interprets rapid price moves and subsequent reversals as evidence about the speed and accuracy of information incorporation.

  "personalized_feedback": "Jaime — I want to celebrate how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to deliberate, repeatable analysis. Your work showed concrete strengths: you built a clear decision tree for the investment case, articulated and defended your DCF assumptions (growth, margin, discount rate) with business logic, and used the DRIVER structure to keep each step linked to the next. I could see your “logic guardrails” in action — your inputs, calculations, and outputs formed a cohesive story rather than isolated numbers. You also used AI thoughtfully as an execution assistant to automate routine checks, which freed you to reason about tradeoffs.\n\nFor next steps, treat the model like a business conversation, not just a numerical exercise. Practical suggestions:\n- Add structured sensitivity and scenario layers (best/worst/case-specific macro shocks) so stakeholders can see how decisions change under stress — this maps directly to capital-allocation discussions.\n- Translate model outputs into 2–3 decision metrics executives care about (IRR vs. payback vs. cash runway) and visualize those in a simple dashboard or slide for faster uptake.\n- Introduce probabilistic thinking: replace single-point estimates with ranges or distributions where possible and summarize the probability of meeting target returns.\n- Practice narrating the model: prepare a one-page “what keeps CFOs awake” memo that links model levers to company levers (pricing, working capital, capex) and recommended actions.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as the core skill — it’s what makes you valuable across FP&A, strategy, or corporate development. This is a long arc; each model you build will sharpen your judgment. I’m excited to see where you apply this next — keep pushing the model toward real business conversations.  \n— Professor Zhang"
