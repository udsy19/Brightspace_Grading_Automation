  "transcript": "Alright, so, Solution 8, assignment, and it goes through the analyst paradox, okay. So we did all that, you know, the assignment. And it's got a case study, and it's on that market efficiency and estimation. Uhh, analyzing GameStop. Uhh, and then the critical step is, GameStop traded for 4 cents in August of 2020. So we have to go, And it gives us a timeline and key points. So we first went and then we verified, August of 2020. So, this, You was traded for 4 cents, so, it was not traded for 4 cents, so I asked Google to help me explain it in the simplest way. So, when I first did, it was made a driver framework. Umm. Umm. Umm. You can pause and read it. Umm. So, what I did is I had, I wrote, I had to keep it simple on how to write the code if I could do it over here. I did it in steps, so I'll run one. Actual approximate price in August of 2020 was $4. The correct thing to claim before us is highly inaccurate. It was a hundred times higher, yep. So, and then we did all the math for it. And I had, so I wanted to see some, umm. The store code theta, so it pulled it and made it into some graphs. Again, this uh, the assignment was to do the case study. And this is the framework I used.",
