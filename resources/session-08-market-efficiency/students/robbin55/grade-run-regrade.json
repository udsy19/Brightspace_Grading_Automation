  "personalized_feedback": "Scott — I’ve been really impressed by how you’ve shifted from ad‑hoc answers to a predictable, repeatable approach when tackling finance problems. You consistently break big questions into DRIVER steps (define the problem, identify inputs, run logic, evaluate results, report)—for example, your recent cash‑flow decomposition showed clear hypothesis framing, careful identification of drivers, and documented assumptions. That discipline — mapping each output back to its inputs — is exactly the transformation we’re after: systematic thinking that makes noisy judgments auditable and defensible.\n\nNow the practical next steps to accelerate growth. Three finance concepts need tightening: revisit the intuition behind valuation (how discount rates map to risk and timing), the mechanics of working‑capital flows (how changes in receivables/inventory translate to cash), and standard risk metrics (beta, volatility, and how they affect cost of capital). Concrete actions: (1) Rebuild a simple 3‑statement model for a small business and trace one change (e.g., 1% price increase) through income, balance sheet, and cash flow to see real business impact; (2) run sensitivity tables and tornado charts so you can show stakeholders which assumptions move value the most; (3) codify three unit checks (e.g., cash = prior cash + flows, no negative inventory) so your logic guardrails catch common mistakes. For integration, explicitly link model outputs to business KPIs—EBITDA margins, free cash flow, payback period—so technical results become actionable recommendations.\n\nKeep going — your methodical habits are career gold. Treat each model as a client conversation: structure, test, explain. Over time that discipline will let you move from accurate numerics to persuasive business advice. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
