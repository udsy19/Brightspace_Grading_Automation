Per the rubric, absence of that conceptual coverage warrants a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student engaged the case and performed quantitative work (DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT) but the transcript contains no explicit discussion of event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, benchmark model, aggregation) or how abnormal returns were computed.

  "personalized_feedback": "Scott —\n\nI want to start by highlighting how you’ve shifted from scattered attempts to clearly structured analysis. You consistently laid out your problem assumptions before diving into calculations, asked for boundary conditions when a model felt shaky, and used AI to prototype scenarios rather than treating it as a shortcut. Those moves show real DRIVER-style maturation: you’re building logic guardrails, thinking in stages, and are already comfortable connecting model outputs to business questions — all concrete signs of systematic thinking.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening a few finance fundamentals and the verification layer of your workflow. Financial concepts: pick the five concepts that gave you trouble (for example, the mechanics of NPV vs. IRR, working capital dynamics, cost of capital components, lease accounting impacts, and risk-adjusted discounting) and do two things for each — (a) write a one-paragraph business interpretation (when would a CFO care?), and (b) run a small numeric sensitivity test that shows how outcomes move when a key input shifts 10–20%. For technical implementation, add simple validation checks: build quick unit checks for edge cases (zero revenue, negative cash flow) and assert that accounting identities balance. For DRIVER alignment, make your Define → Assumptions → Model → Verify → Explain loop explicit at the top of each notebook or report so reviewers see your thinking path.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as the core product — companies pay for clarity and defensible decisions. You’re on a durable trajectory: with these targeted habits you’ll convert good instincts into trusted financial judgment that leaders rely on. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
