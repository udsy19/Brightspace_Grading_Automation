  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states a clear, testable objective and verifies data baseline (Discover) and then specifies a concrete event‑study research design (estimation window, market model, event window, abnormal returns) (Represent), satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of Define & Discover. The level of specificity is sufficient for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, explicit framework for analyzing efficiency around the event—specifying estimation and event windows, market‑model regression to obtain alpha/beta, calculation of expected and abnormal returns, and use of CAR—meeting the strict requirement for explicit methodology. The plan is actionable and linked to implementation, so it satisfies the Represent criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, systematic implementation matching their Represent plan—data preparation, regression estimation, per‑day expected/abnormal return calculation, aggregation into CAR, and visualization—producing multiple outputs and interpretations. This organized workflow and execution satisfy the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies an event-study framework and clearly identifies weak- and semi-strong-form violations, demonstrating correct conceptual understanding and practical implementation (Discover, Implement, Validate). However, treatment is incomplete for a thorough PASS: the strong-form is not addressed and the discussion lacks a comprehensive, explicit definition and examination of all three EMH forms and counterarguments.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements the core event‑study steps (estimation window, market model regression, daily abnormal returns and CAR) and provides code/output evidence, demonstrating practical understanding (Implement). However the treatment lacks thoroughness required for a PASS: no mention of statistical significance tests, robustness checks, choice/justification of windows, or controls for confounding events, so the methodology is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and implements an event‑study and uses CARs to argue markets did not quickly incorporate public information (semi‑strong form), showing conceptual understanding and practical application (Implement/Validate). However treatment is incomplete for a PASS: there is no detailed timing analysis (e.g., intraday vs. multi‑day incorporation), no statistical significance or robustness checks, and limited quantification of \"how quickly\" information was reflected.",

You now approach problems with a DRIVER-like structure: your models start with a clear statement of the decision, you list assumptions explicitly, and you build scenario branches rather than one-off numbers. In recent work I noticed crisp communication of assumptions and concise sensitivity tables — those are concrete signs you’re turning “monkey mind” into systematic reasoning. Your progression on integrating finance and tech (e.g., using model guardrails and automated checks) shows you’re treating code as a logic tool, not an end in itself.\n\nNext steps to tighten the final mile: one financial-concepts criterion still needs attention where model outputs didn’t fully align with the economic logic. Actionable things to do next:\n- Reconcile assumption → formula → output: add a short “assumption-to-impact” note for each key variable (what economic mechanism links the assumption to the cash flow).  \n- Build simple validation checks (unit consistency, sign checks, conservation of cash) that flag when intuitive relationships break — these are the lightweight “audit trails” business managers love.  \n- Practice two business scenarios: pricing change and a capex shock. For each, write a one-paragraph recommendation that connects numbers to a decision (invest, defer, raise funds) so your technical work maps to real finance outcomes.\n\nKeep treating AI and code as execution aids: use them to generate alternative assumptions, but always narrate the economic story behind the numbers. You’re on a trajectory many graduates don’t reach — systematic thinking will make your analyses faster to produce, easier to defend, and far more persuasive to executives. Treat this as an ongoing craft; each model is another rehearsal in making rigorous, business-ready decisions. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
