  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Define/Discover objective, frames the testing question (EMH forms), and documents the initial validation action (verifying the 4-cent claim). Under the strict DRIVER standard requiring explicit demonstration of the problem definition, this meets the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan: data acquisition, specific tests (weak- and semi-strong), required formulas (expected return, AR, CAR), tools, and next-step analyses (social media linkage). This verbal plan satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit represent-stage layout.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed external validation by naming Yahoo Finance, comparing the 4-cent claim to Yahoo's historical data, and presenting a chart as evidence. This meets the validate-stage requirement to use a specific external source and compare results, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and conceptually applies weak- and semi-strong form tests, uses data and charts, and links behavioral explanations—showing understanding. However treatment is basic (visual inspection, no quantitative abnormal-return/CAR analysis, no explicit discussion of strong-form implications), so the work demonstrates correct but incomplete coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies event-study components (expected return model, abnormal returns, CAR) and obtained data, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform the actual abnormal-return calculations or present CAR/event-window results—analysis remained primarily visual—so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding by naming semi-strong tests and proposing mapping news to price moves and abnormal-return methods. However, they stopped at visual inspection and did not measure how quickly or accurately new information was incorporated (no event-window timing, intraday analysis, or quantified reaction metrics), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Meher — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve shifted from scattered “what-if” thinking to the disciplined DRIVER approach. You consistently framed problems with explicit Drivers, wrote down assumptions before coding, and used logical steps to move from inputs to decisions. Those concrete habits — calling out trade-offs, isolating one driver at a time, and treating code as a guardrail rather than the goal — are exactly the mindset finance teams pay premium for. I also noticed you used AI productively as an execution assistant to prototype scenarios, which accelerated your exploration without replacing your judgment.\n\nNext steps to convert this momentum into real-world impact:\n- Strengthen the bridge between model outputs and financial statements: practice reconciling projected cash flows to balance sheet effects and produce a one-page “accounting check” for each model.\n- Tighten your technical implementation where needed by modularizing your workbook or script (inputs → driver blocks → aggregation → outputs), adding simple input-validation checks, and building a sensitivity table that management can scan in minutes.\n- Improve integration with business KPIs by mapping each driver to revenue, cost, or capital metrics and creating 2–3 scenario narratives (base / upside / downside) that tie numbers to decisions like pricing, hiring, or capex.\n- Sharpen communication: lead with a single recommendation, include a two‑line rationale, and use one visual that demonstrates the decision hinge (break-even, sensitivity, or NPV curve).\n\nThis is a journey, not a finish line. Your systematic thinking already sets you apart for roles in FP&A, corporate strategy, or investment analysis. Keep iterating: each model you build should be a clearer, faster decision tool for stakeholders. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
