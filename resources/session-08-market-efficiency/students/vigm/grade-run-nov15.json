  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly follows DRIVER stages—defining the research question, specifying data and tests, implementing data collection/visualization, and validating the initial claim—providing a clear research design a reviewer could follow. Methods and next steps are stated (weak/semi-strong tests, CAPM/abnormal returns, sentiment analysis), meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, actionable framework for event-centered efficiency analysis: data sources, specific weak/semi-strong tests, event-to-news mapping, and the exact metrics (abnormal returns, CAR) to compute. The plan is explicit and reproducible, meeting the strict requirement for a well-defined Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external validation by explicitly comparing the assignment claim to Yahoo Finance data and reporting the factual mismatch, satisfying the criterion's requirement for external validation of results. While no statistical significance tests were reported, the rubric emphasizes external source comparison as sufficient for passing this Validate criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies basic tests for weak and semi-strong forms, cites examples (news, Reddit, short interest) and uses data/plots—showing conceptual understanding. However treatment is high-level and lacks depth (no rigorous tests, limited discussion of strong-form implications), so it meets a correct but basic standard rather than a thorough, detailed treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names event-study elements and abnormal-return formulas and shows data acquisition/plotting — demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform or report actual abnormal return or CAR calculations (no estimation window, model fit, or numeric results), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information-incorporation testing (mapping news to price moves) and gathered/visualized data, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However they did not measure speed or accuracy quantitatively (no event-window timing, no statistical tests or lag analysis), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Meher — I want to highlight how clearly you’ve shifted from reactive tinkering to disciplined, stepwise problem solving. In recent assignments you consistently broke complex finance problems into digestible parts, mapped each piece to a clear objective, and communicated your reasoning in a way that made the logic traceable. That systematic decomposition — framing the business question, isolating key drivers, and explicating assumptions — is exactly the core DRIVER mindset coming through. I also noticed real progress in translating financial concepts (cash flow relationships, discounting logic, and scenario thinking) into structured analyses that a stakeholder could follow.\n\nNext steps to build on that foundation: focus on tightening the technical implementation loop so your finance logic is fully robust in practice. Concretely:\n- Strengthen the “Verify” step: for every numeric output, add simple sanity checks (e.g., conservation of cash, sign checks, and basic unit tests) and run a couple of edge-case scenarios.\n- Make assumptions explicit and stress-test them with sensitivity tables tied to business KPIs (revenues, margins, discount rates). That connects your work directly to real finance decisions like budgeting, valuation, and risk allocation.\n- Iterate the DRIVER cycle faster: after you decompose a problem, prototype a minimal calculation that answers one sub-question, then validate with a quick reality check from a market or accounting perspective.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution partners, not substitutes — your value is in setting the right logic guardrails and interpreting results for business leaders. You’re building a durable habit: structured thinking that transforms fuzzy business problems into actionable financial insight. Stick with that trajectory — the ability to systematize uncertainty will be one of your most valuable career assets. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
