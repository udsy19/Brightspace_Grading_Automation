  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, scope, event window, and planned analyses, satisfying the strict requirement for clear Define & Discover articulation. The statements provide sufficient, unambiguous framing for subsequent DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides an explicit, structured plan for analyzing market efficiency (frameworks, event window, specific comparisons and method), meeting the strict requirement for a clear Represent stage. The steps are concrete and sufficient for a reviewer to understand the intended analysis approach.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student shows a systematic workflow following their Represent plan: they ran analyses (code/calculations), produced multiple outputs (graphs comparing GME to the S&P and price/volume charts), and performed data verification and robustness checks. While some technical details and full code traceability are absent, the methodological execution is clearly organized and aligned with the DRIVER plan, satisfying the Implement-stage criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines all three EMH forms and provides a substantive applied analysis of weak and semi-strong forms with concrete examples (short interest, Ryan Cohen stake) and reasoning. However, treatment of the strong form is minimal (definition only, no applied discussion), so the coverage is correct but not comprehensive enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies an event-study framing and reports large abnormal returns with claimed statistical significance (Discover + Implement + Reflect). However, they do not present key methodological details (estimation window, expected-return model, AR/CAR formulas, test statistics) or documented calculations/tests, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses public-information incorporation (short interest, SEC filings) and argues the semi-strong form was violated, citing predictability and market frictions. However, they provide mainly qualitative claims without documented timing analysis (event windows, immediate reaction metrics) or formal tests of how quickly prices incorporated new information, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Michael —\n\nIt’s been a pleasure watching your DRIVER transformation unfold. You’ve moved from ad hoc intuition to disciplined decomposition: your problem framing (Define the decision, Identify drivers, and lay out Assumptions) was consistently clear, and your scenario structure made trade-offs transparent for each financing choice. I noticed you leaned on AI to generate alternative cash‑flow scenarios while you focused on the economic logic — exactly the “AI as execution assistant” approach DRIVER recommends. Your ability to translate business questions into structured, testable hypotheses shows real systematic thinking growth.\n\nNext steps to level up: tighten the one remaining technical thread. Focus on three practical actions that map directly to business finance use cases:\n- Add validation checks and sensitivity routines to your models (e.g., balance‑checks, sign/scale assertions, and automated sensitivity sweeps). In a boardroom, these are the items that build stakeholder trust.\n- Codify edge‑case rules (late payments, negative working capital, seasonal demand shocks) into discrete scenarios so forecasting and stress testing are repeatable and auditable.\n- Produce concise decision summaries tied to key metrics (NPV, IRR, cash‑runway) and a short “what to monitor” dashboard for post‑decision execution. That makes your analysis operationally actionable for CFOs and operators.\n\nKeep treating analytical structure as the product. The systematic habits you’re building — explicit assumptions, scenario discipline, and testable logic — will compound over your career and make you the kind of finance professional who reduces ambiguity for teams and leaders. This is a journey; you’ve got a strong compass. I’m excited to see where you apply it next.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
