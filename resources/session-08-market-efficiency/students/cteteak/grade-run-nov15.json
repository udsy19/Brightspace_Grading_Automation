  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies all three EMH forms to the GameStop case, cites specific empirical observations (price/volume/RSI, verified low price) and structural facts (140% short interest, limits to arbitrage), and links these to behavioral/microstructure mechanisms. The treatment is comprehensive and well-reasoned across DRIVER stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual analysis.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student moved beyond basic checks by computing and interpreting multiple technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, volume) across an explicit event window and used those data patterns to generate substantive insights (momentum, overbought signals, trading frenzy) tied to market-structure facts. The treatment is data-driven, multi-faceted, and well-integrated with the analysis, satisfying the standard for thorough insights beyond basic calculations.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the testing problem and research design (clear objective, explicit event window, data sources/fields, and noted limitations), and provided a concrete data-acquisition plan. This meets the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student verifies prices and uses technical charts and qualitative arguments, but does not describe or execute an event-study methodology (no estimation/event windows, market model, abnormal returns, or statistical tests). Because the required event-study/abnormal return calculations are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how public information (high short interest) was not immediately reflected in price and uses timeline, volume, and RSI evidence to argue delayed incorporation. However, they do not perform formal timing tests or quantify the speed/accuracy of information incorporation (no event-window, abnormal-return, or statistical analysis), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and explains several relevant biases (herding, confirmation bias, availability bias, FOMO) and links them to market outcomes, showing conceptual understanding. However, key listed biases—overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, and mental accounting—are not explicitly discussed or analyzed, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Cody — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you communicate your thinking. In your assignments you consistently lay out assumptions, walk a reader step-by-step through your logic, and choose simple language to explain complex ideas. Those are exactly the habits that turn a “monkey mind” into a dependable analyst: your explanations make it easy for others to validate and challenge your conclusions, which is the core of systematic thinking.\n\nNow for next steps to sharpen impact. I noticed a few recurring places where financial concepts and model integration need tighter alignment — for example, reconciling timing of cash flows with your discounting approach, and explicitly linking risk adjustments to the business decision being evaluated. Actionable next steps:\n- When you build a valuation or project case, write a one-paragraph “finance checklist” before modeling: timing of inflows/outflows, working capital rules, tax treatment, and the rationale for your discount rate. That will catch many conceptual mismatches early.\n- Run two simple business-focused tests on every model: a break-even sensitivity (which input flips the decision) and a scenario that ties assumptions to real business triggers (e.g., what revenue growth implies for capacity or working capital).\n- Practice a short integration exercise: present a three-slide memo to a hypothetical CFO that links model outputs to a capital decision — assumptions, how the numbers change the decision, and one operational action that would alter the outcome.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails: they enforce logic, but the business question drives the work. Your clear communication is a rare strength — combine it with tighter finance-concept checks and routine decision-focused tests, and you’ll be the sort of analyst leaders rely on. This is a career-long craft; you’re on a strong trajectory. I’m excited to see where your next iteration takes you."
