  "transcript": "My name is Cody TEK and today I will be presenting my investigation into market efficiency using the 2020 GameStop short squeeze as a case study. This assignment required us to analyze this event through the lens of the efficient market hypothesis. Evaluate behavioral expect explanations and as a critical first step verify a specific historical fact. Um to start with the define and discover phase. So following the driver framework, I started with the define and discover stage. Obviously uh the assignment's goal is to investigate market efficiency using uh the GME event. A critical first step was to verify a specific claim that we were given that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. My analytical scope was defined as the period from August 1st, 2020 to March 31st, 2021, which allows us to capture the leadup, the squeeze itself, and then the immediate aftermath. The data source I identified was Yahoo Finance uh accessed via the Y finance library in Python. Uh the required data points were the standard date, open, high, low, close, and volume. I also noted potential limitations such as the accuracy of the free data versus professional terminals and the need to use adjusted close prices for accurate historical comparisons, which Yahoo Finance thankfully handles. Next is the represent phase. Um, this is where I actually like planned the data acquisition. This was a very straightforward plan. First, I'd import the uh Y finance in the pandas library. Then define the ticker GME and then the uh start and end dates. Finally, I'd then use the YF download function to fetch the data. And then, as you can see from the slide and my notebook, I then called uh head and info on the new data frame. This was to ensure the data loaded correctly and all the columns were proper data type for analysis. Then we get to our implement stage. This is where I executed that critical first step uh verifying the statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. Before analyzing the why of the squeeze, I had to make certain of the what. My process in the notebook was simple. Uh first, I filtered the main data frame to isolate the August 2020 price. Second, I used the min function on the low price column and the idx min function to find the exact date this minimum actually occurred. Finally, I compared this actual minimum price to the stated 4 cents. The results were conclusive as the output shows the minimum low price for uh GameStop in August 2020 was a dollar, not 4 cents. This low occurred on August 3rd, 2020. Therefore, the premise that GME was trading for pennies is inaccurate. While a dollar is still pretty low, it reflects its near bankruptcy status. Uh it's a significant uh factual difference from the 4 cents. This verification was crucial before proceeding with the rest of the analysis. Moving on to the validate stage, I analyzed the data to understand the squeeze behavior and compare it to the predictions of the efficient market hypothesis. I calculated and plotted several different uh technical indicators. So this first chart is the most telling. It shows the GMA closed price in blue against its 50-day and 200 day moving averages. You can see the price was flat around $1 to4 from August to December of 2020. Then in late January 2021, an explosive surge to over $80 on this chart and then an actual peak of $483. The second chart uh here shows the trading volume. The volume spikes are astronomical uh corresponding perfectly with the price surge in late January confirming that this was a frenzy of activity. Then there's the code with it. My notebook also includes the RSI chart. The relative strength index um peaked well above 90 signaling wildly overbought conditions far beyond what traditional analysis would deem rational. So then let's test this against like the forms of market efficiency. Was the weak form violated? This form says you can't predict future prices from uh past data. The GME event driven by momentum seems to violate this, but it's arguable as the squeeze itself was based on public data. Um namely the high short interest. Uh was the semi- strong form violated? I believe so. Yes. Uh this form says all public information is already reflected in the price. Uh here the short interest data was public for months but the price didn't move until a coordinated social media fed acted effort effort acted on it. The price was clearly not reflecting fundamentals which analysts estimated around $10 to $40. Was the strong form violated? Yes. This form says even private info is priced in the coordinated non-fundamental buying clearly drove the price which is inconsistent with this form. The price behavior was completely was completely an anomaly uh that rational investors could not have systematically profited uh without taking on massive um unquantifiable risk. Then we get to our evolve phase where we evaluate why this happened. If EMH can't fully explain it, what can? This is where behavioral finance and then market micro structure actually come in. So, first behavioral proc finance provides several key explanations. Um, hurting behavior. This was the primary driver. Millions of retail investors coordinated on Wall Street bets uh popular Reddit and then acted as a single massive entity. Um, narrative driven trading. This wasn't just about money. It was about the story. The David versus Goliath um narrative was incredibly powerful. This narrative com narrative combined with FOMO uh led to buying pressure that was completely divorced from fundamental value. We also saw confirmation bias as investors sought info that confirmed their belief in the squeeze and the availability bias from the intense media coverage. Second, market micro structure is key. The event was possible because short interest had peaked at 140% of the float. This created what's known as limits to arbitrage situation. It was structural vulnerability. The retail herd exploited this, igniting a short squeeze. As the price rose, hedge funds like Melvin Capital were forced to buy shares at any price to cover their short positions, which only pushed the price higher in a feedback loop. This wasn't about fundamentals. It was about the mechanical supply and demand. So the implication is that while markets may be mostly efficient, they are not perfectly efficient. The GameStop event shows that a combination of behavioral biases and market structure vulnerabilities can create massive short-term anomalies. Finally, we get to our reflection phase. This brings us back to the beginning. So first, the the summary of findings. Uh the professor's statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020 is inaccurate. The actual low was a dollar on August 3rd, 2020. Uh, this analysis of GameStop squeeze demonstrates a significant though likely temporary deviation from market efficiency, best explained by a combination of behavioral finance and market microructure issues. Second, the stage requires determining the appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor. The objective is to be respectful while demonstrating through analysis. So our approach would be first to acknowledge the professor's statement as the starting point for the verification. Um then state my finding in verifying the historical data. I analyzeed the low prices for GameStop in August of 2020 from Yahoo Finance. I found that the minimum was a dollar on August 3rd 2020 rather than the 4 cents mo uh mentioned in the original prompt. The key is to frame this as not like a you are wrong but as an important finding to ensure the rest of the market efficiency analysis was built on correct and precise foundation. This entire exercise um from define and discover to reflect demonstrates the value of the driver framework starting with a clear question verifying assumptions implementing an anal an analysis and then reflecting on a broader on the broader implications of the findings.
