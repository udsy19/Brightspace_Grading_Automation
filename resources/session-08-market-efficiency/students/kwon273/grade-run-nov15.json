  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, specific event-study implementation: defined estimation/event windows, used CAPM to compute expected returns, calculated abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and conducted statistical and robustness tests. These elements meet the standards for a comprehensive demonstration of market-efficiency testing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission directly tests how quickly information is incorporated using a clear event-study framework, computes abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and reports statistically significant post-event drift. Robustness checks and microstructure discussion further demonstrate a thorough, accurate treatment of information incorporation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student moved beyond basic calculations by validating source data, implementing a CAPM-based event study, computing abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, performing robustness/statistical tests, and interpreting results in light of market-microstructure and behavioral factors. These data-driven analyses and contextual insights satisfy the criterion for substantive integration of finance and technology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, specific understanding and rigorous testing of the semi-strong form (methodology, statistical tests, robustness), but they do not explicitly discuss the weak or strong forms (e.g., predictability from past prices or insider-information implications). Because the coverage is thorough for semi-strong but incomplete across all three EMH forms, the appropriate rating is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly recognizes behavioral explanations for the GameStop event and links them to persistence of mispricing with robustness checks. However, they do not explicitly identify or analyze the specific biases named in the criterion (overconfidence, anchoring, herding, loss aversion, mental accounting), so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission thoroughly analyzes the GameStop event via event-study methods but does not discuss or test classic market anomalies (momentum, value, size, calendar effects). Because the required anomaly concepts were neither identified nor analyzed, the criterion is not met.",

You consistently tied finance ideas to technology in a way that shows real systems thinking: your decomposition of enterprise value into operating cash‑flow drivers and your clear mapping from revenue-growth assumptions to working capital needs were both concrete strengths. Your written explanations made complex tradeoffs (growth vs. margin, short‑term liquidity vs. long‑term value) easy to follow — that clarity is exactly what turns “monkey mind” intuition into repeatable reasoning.\n\nNext steps to accelerate: strengthen a couple of key finance fundamentals so your system holds up under scrutiny. First, build a short reconciliation table that ties your income statement assumptions to free cash flow (start with sales → EBITDA → NOPAT → ΔWC → capex → FCF). That single table removes many common errors and directly maps to capital budgeting and valuation use cases. Second, formalize sensitivity and scenario routines: pick the 3 most impactful assumptions (e.g., growth rate, margin, capex intensity), run a 3×3 sensitivity grid and one downside stress test, and summarize how decision metrics (NPV/IRR or enterprise value) respond. Finally, when you document an assumption, add its business rationale (market data, management target, or benchmark) so the model explains decisions the way a CFO would in a board meeting.\n\nKeep going — your systematic approach is the career multiplier. As you tighten the financial linkages and standardize sanity checks, you’ll move from being someone who builds good models to someone who makes robust business recommendations under uncertainty. This is a marathon: every disciplined habit you add compounds into clearer decisions and greater influence. I’m excited to see where you take this."
