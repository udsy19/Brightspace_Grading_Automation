  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided a detailed, coherent event-study methodology (estimation window, CAPM model, event window, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns), executed it with code-based data processing, and validated findings with statistical testing and robustness checks. This constitutes a thorough and competent treatment of event-study testing and abnormal return calculation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly tested information incorporation speed using a well-specified event study, calculated abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and performed statistical and robustness checks that showed persistent post-event drift. Combined methodological detail, empirical results, and interpretation of market frictions provide a thorough treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly explains how abnormal returns were computed (CAPM expected return subtraction), implemented the calculations in code, and validated results with statistical testing and robustness checks. They also interpret the abnormal-return persistence in light of market frictions, providing a thorough, well-integrated explanation that meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, applied understanding of semi-strong EMH (clear hypothesis, appropriate event-study methods, statistical testing, and robustness checks). However, they do not discuss or test the weak and strong forms of EMH, so coverage of the full criterion (all three forms) is incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and described abnormal-return calculations (estimation window, CAPM, subtraction to get abnormal returns, CARs, and statistical tests), and states they executed these steps in Python. However, per the strict technical standard, they did not present block-by-block code-level explanation or explicit verification/ownership of individual functions, so the implementation is evident but not demonstrated in the detailed, verifiable way required for a full PASS.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student gives a correct and applied explanation of semi-strong EMH (what immediate adjustment implies and how persistent abnormal returns contradict it) and integrates that into methods and interpretation. However, treatment is narrowly focused on the semi-strong form and lacks discussion of weak and strong forms or broader theoretical depth, so the explanation is correct but not comprehensive.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Anthony —\n\nWatching your work this term has been a pleasure. You’ve moved from scattered “monkey mind” guesses to a clear DRIVER-driven approach: you consistently break problems into decision points, identify relevant inputs, and trace the impact of assumptions through cash-flow and valuation outcomes. A concrete example I keep returning to is your scenario write-up for the retail expansion case — you separated demand drivers, margin levers, and financing choices cleanly and showed how each fed the NPV and payback timeline. That kind of decomposition is exactly the systematic thinking we train for.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening the technical implementation layer so your excellent logic is executed reliably in business settings. Practical, low-friction actions:\n- Turn your scenario decompositions into repeatable templates (standard input sheets + a “what-if” checklist) so stakeholders can run sensitivity tests without re-deriving logic.\n- Formalize assumption provenance: for every driver, cite the source, range, and a simple stress rule (e.g., -20% sales shock, +2% cost inflation).\n- Translate one case into a decision-ready deliverable: a two-page memo that highlights the key lever, quantified downside, and a recommended hedge or contingency (capex delay, working-capital buffer, alternative financing).\nThese steps map directly to FP&A and corporate development work — they make your analysis actionable, auditable, and persuasive to decision-makers.\n\nKeep treating models as logic guardrails and use AI as your execution assistant, not the final judge. Your systematic habits are the career compounder — they’ll differentiate you in strategy, treasury, and fintech roles. This is a long climb, and you’re already on the ridge; keep building repeatable, business-focused artifacts and the view will keep expanding.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
