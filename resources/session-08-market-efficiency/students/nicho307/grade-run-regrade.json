  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides correct, clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, and implements a coherent semi-strong test (beta estimation, abnormal returns, validation). They interpret results and discuss limitations, demonstrating thorough conceptual understanding and application consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and coherently describes and implements an event-study approach (estimation window, beta regression to estimate expected returns, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and validates the data, then interprets results. Details such as test statistics are not fully enumerated, but the methodology and application are thorough enough to meet PASS under the moderate rubric.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames information incorporation, implements an appropriate event-study method (expected returns via beta, abnormal/CAR calculations), validates data, and interprets timing of price response—concluding the market did not instantaneously incorporate public information. While detailed statistical outputs (e.g., test stats) are not fully enumerated, the methodological application and interpretation are thorough enough for PASS under the moderate rubric.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly describes and applies the event-study steps and reports regression output (beta) and planned abnormal/CAR calculations, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, under the strict technical standard they do not provide explicit, personal, block-by-block confirmation of running the code or detailed explanation of implementation steps and outputs (no explicit \"I ran X code and these exact results/metrics were produced\" or code-level walkthrough), so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Adisyn —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve moved from “monkey mind” instincts to a clear, repeatable way of thinking. You consistently demonstrate mastery of core financial concepts — your explanations of cash flow dynamics, discounting, and the trade-offs in capital allocation were precise and used the right intuition for business decisions. You also brought technology into your analysis in a meaningful way: your scenario structures and the way you linked assumptions to outcomes showed you understand how tools can enforce logical guardrails. Most importantly, you followed the DRIVER sequence every time — you decomposed problems, isolated key drivers, justified assumptions, and communicated the implications cleanly. Your write-ups made trade-offs and decision points obvious, which is exactly the kind of systematic thinking business finance needs.\n\nNext steps (practical and business-focused):\n- Turn your logical frameworks into compact, reproducible decision tools. Build a one-page model that ties drivers to KPIs (revenue per unit, margin, churn) and produces clear decision triggers (invest, pause, pivot).\n- Add structured sensitivity and scenario testing: a three-scenario (base/bear/bull) table plus a simple sensitivity heatmap lets executives see where decisions hinge on assumptions.\n- Practice documenting assumptions as “if–then” statements and include an executive summary with recommended actions and contingency triggers—this makes your analysis directly actionable for managers.\n- Run a short live review with a peer or stakeholder to practice defending assumptions and translating outputs into a business recommendation.\n\nKeep pushing this path. Systematic thinking is the difference between being a smart analyst and being a trusted strategic partner. You’re building a toolkit that will let you make high-leverage decisions under uncertainty — keep iterating, and the clarity you bring will amplify across teams and projects.\n\nWarmly,\nProfessor Zhang"
