  "transcript": "Hi everyone. Uh welcome to my driver analysis of uh GameStop uh GME market efficiency investigation. Um so let's begin uh the define and discover stage of of the driver framework. Uh the problem we're investigating is market efficiency. specifically whether the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 violated the efficient market hypothesis or if the price behavior can still be explained within existing theory. Uh the first requirement is to verify factual accuracy. One common misconception I found online and even in some some class materials is that GameStop traded at um 4 cents in August 2020. uh to that claim. Um in cell 2 uh and everything that I I used um I used with the help of uh Gemini to create this Python code for this assignment. Um so yeah, in cell 2 I ran a quick fact check using Yahoo Finance and uh Stamuse data. Uh GameStop actually closed around $167 on August 31st uh 2020, not 4 cents. that means that the statement is false and it's important to correct it politely. Um, for example, by citing verified data sources instead of just contradicting the claim. Um so yeah in cells one through three I set up the environment imported standard um Python finance libraries and downloaded historical data for both um uh historical data for both GameStop and the the SNP uh 500 ETF um SPY uh starting August 2020 through the present uh these data sets will be the foundation for our uh efficiency analysis. All right. Um so yeah in uh let's move on to the represent stage. Um so the represent stage is where I translate the reason uh or translate the research question into a structured analytical framework. Um so in cell four I calculated daily simple log returns um for GM me and uh spy. Uh this converts raw price data into stationary time series suitable for uh statistical testing. Um cell five uh this this visualized the adjusted uh closing price and daily trading volume on a log scale. we can clearly see that the massive spike in both price and volume in January 2021 um characteristic of the short squeeze. Um so yeah and then in in cell six um I define key events uh event dates based on credible news milestones. Um, so like September 2020, Ryan Cohen stake announcement. Um, December 2020, early um, uh, Wall Street, that's buzz. Uh, January 28th, 2021, um, price peak and Robin Hood restrictions. February 2021 hearings. Uh, so these timestamps allow us to structure an event setting design around specific market reactions. All right, so let's move on to the implement stage. Um, so now that our framework is in place, uh, we move to the implementation stage. Uh, performing actual market efficiency testing. Uh, so in cell 7, I define a reusable function that estimates a simple CAPM regression over 120 um, day estimation window and computes uh, abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal uh returns in a plus or minus 10day event window. Um so yeah, and then in cell 8 uh applies this to January 28 or January 28 uh 2021 squeeze peak. Uh the model outputs an alpha and beta um uh roughly how GameStop moved relative to market risk before the event. Um so yeah the resulting abnormal returns show huge positive deviations during the squeeze period far beyond what CAPM would predict to test whether uh these cumulative abnormal returns are statistically significant. Cell 9 bootstraps C values and runs both t tests and empirical p values. The C remains highly significant suggesting semi- strong form inefficiency prices did not adjust purely based on uh fundamentals or publicly available information. Um so yeah in cell 10 I examine weak form efficiency. The autocorrelation function shows meaningful serial correlation and short-term returns and the jeong uh box test rejects the null of pure randomness. Um, cell 11 adds a variance to ratio check. Ratios deviate from one. Uh, again hinting that prices were not following a random walk during this extreme period. Um, finally in cell 12 uh sim it simulates a a simple buy and hold strategy from December 1st, 2020 to the January 28th, 2021 peak. uh that produced returns over several thousand uh%. Clearly an abnormal gain, but one that would have uh required ex um ex uh excente um prediction and tolerance for extreme volatility. Uh rational investors couldn't reliably capture this profit without um taking extraordinary risk or violating trading constraints. meaning expost profits do not necessarily refute efficient efficiency entirely. Um all right so let's validate um and in the the validate stage I check the the robust robustness of my findings. Um cell 13 runs two validation check uh um cell 13 runs two validation tests. Uh first a placebo event uh on an arbitrary um uh on an arbitrary October 2020 date. The C there is close to zero confirming our method doesn't produce false positives. Second, I repeat the event study with a longer estimation window to test sensitivity to uh parameter choice. The sign and magnitude of abnormal returns remain consistent. Um so these validations strengthen confidence that our observed and efficiency is tied to a genuine event driven uh behavior not statistical noise. Uh so let's evolve uh the evolve stage translates findings into theoretical and practical implications. So cell 14 I summarize the the key insights. The factual correction GameStop never traded at 4 cents. uh weak form uh inefficiency appeared through short-term predictability during the squeeze. Semi-rong inefficiency was evident because prices uh reacted dramatically to social media attention rather than fundamental news. uh expost profits existed but were accompanied by liquidity constraints and short selling restrictions aligning with behavioral finance and limits to our arbitrage uh explanations for an uh for investors. The episode um underscores why extreme events challenge passive management assumptions but do not fully invalidate EMH uh when viewed over long horizon. Um so yeah finally in the reflect stage um I consolidate the the analytical process the the driver framework forced a disciplined workflow. I began with a clear problem definition and fact verification before any code execution. I represented the the research question using an event study structure. I implemented validated evolved and reflected systematically. Um so yeah cell 15 simply saves the script ensuring a reproductibility and uh code transparency uh a best practice in empirical financial uh research. So yeah, overall the GameStop cause or the GameStop case uh illustrates that markets can temporarily deviate from efficiency due to behavioral biases such as uh hurting overconfidence and attention um cascades amplified by social media. Yet over time, rational valuation anchors tend to reassert themselves consistent with a semi strong form of efficiency once the noise subsidi subsides. Um so yeah, this complete analysis therefore integrates both EMH and behavioral perspective satisfying all assignment requirements for financial accuracy uh technical imple impleation and driver process compliance. So, thank you guys for watching.",
