  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specified and implemented a standard event‑study procedure (CAPM estimation window, +/-10‑day event window), calculated ARs/CARs, and applied rigorous inference (bootstraps, t‑tests, empirical p‑values). Robustness checks (placebo and alternative estimation window) demonstrate thorough, reproducible testing, meeting the PASS standard for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly measured how quickly/accurately new information was reflected using an event‑study (AR/CAR) and inference (bootstraps, t‑tests) and validated results with placebo and sensitivity checks. They interpret findings in terms of semi‑strong inefficiency and short‑term predictability, demonstrating thorough, applied treatment of information incorporation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes implementing abnormal‑return calculations (CAPM estimation, AR/CAR) and reports running them with statistical inference (bootstraps, t‑tests) and validation. They document cell‑level steps and outputs, demonstrating personal execution and block‑by‑block understanding required by this strict technical criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and concretely tests and interprets weak‑form (autocorrelation, variance ratio) and semi‑strong‑form (event study, bootstrapped significance) efficiency with validations, demonstrating solid applied understanding. However, the submission does not explicitly address the strong form of EMH (no discussion/testing of insider/private information or related evidence), so coverage is accurate but incomplete.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly identifies and tests weak and semi‑strong forms with concrete examples (autocorrelation, variance ratio, event study) showing practical understanding. However the treatment is not comprehensive: definitions and theoretical distinctions are only implied rather than explained in depth, and the strong form is not addressed, so the response is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Robert —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from ad-hoc problem solving to a disciplined DRIVER approach. Two concrete strengths stood out: your technical implementation was crisp and reproducible (your model flow and checkpoints made the logic easy to follow), and you tied that implementation directly to finance — you didn’t build a toy model, you mapped outputs to business decisions (forecasted cash impacts and a clear decision trigger). Equally important, you demonstrated the DRIVER checklist end-to-end: defining the decision, isolating drivers, formalizing relationships, instrumenting validation, running experiments, and reporting results. That’s the shift we teach — monkey mind to methodical thinker — and you’ve made it.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (practical, business-facing):\n- Expand scenario and stress testing: codify upside/downside cases and show P&L or cash-flow volatility under each. That makes your model actionable for capital-allocation conversations.\n- Add risk-adjusted KPIs: translate outputs into metrics like economic profit, ROIC changes, or IRR sensitivities so stakeholders can compare opportunities on the same scale.\n- Improve interpretability for non-technical partners: produce a one-page dashboard with the top 3 drivers, their marginal effects, and recommended decisions under each scenario.\n- Close the feedback loop: instrument performance monitoring so the model’s predictions are compared to realized outcomes and updated periodically.\n\nYou’re on a career trajectory that rewards this exact way of thinking: systematic, evidence-driven, and tied to business levers. Keep treating AI and tools as execution partners and focus on translating model outputs into clearer business choices. This is a journey — each iteration sharpens judgment and influence. I’m excited to see where your next iteration leads."
