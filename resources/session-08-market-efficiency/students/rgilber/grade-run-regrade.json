Coverage is specific, well-reasoned, and integrates multiple DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement/Validate, Explain), meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly specified an event-study methodology (market-adjusted AR, estimation/event windows, CAR), implemented it with real data, and validated results with statistical tests and concrete values (e.g., +134% AR, p≈0). This is a thorough, correctly applied treatment of event-study and abnormal-return calculations consistent with the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly targeted information incorporation, implemented an event-study (estimation/event windows, AR/CAR, volume), and validated timing with statistical tests and visual evidence (extreme single-day AR, 5-day CAR, and multi-week correction).

  "personalized_feedback": "Ryan — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER mindset. Your work shows more than familiarity with finance formulas; you structure problems intentionally: you define the decision, isolate the drivers, and trace how assumptions flow into outcomes. That systematic thread — from framing the business question through clean scenario outputs — is exactly the transformation we aim for. I was particularly impressed by how you tied model outputs back to managerial levers and explained trade-offs in plain language for stakeholders.\n\nFor next steps, treat the model as a decision-support tool rather than a number generator. Practical actions:\n- Add sensitivity and scenario matrices for the top 3 revenue and cost drivers so executives can see tipping points quickly.\n- Convert model outputs into 2–3 actionable KPIs (e.g., cash runway, break-even price, contribution margin) and map those KPIs to specific operational levers (pricing, volume, cost controls).\n- Institutionalize assumption transparency: create a concise assumptions dashboard and a one-page “what would change my recommendation” decision memo.\n- Run a quick stress test: what happens under a 20% demand shock and slower receivables? Use that to recommend contingency actions (deferred spend, working-capital negotiation).\n\nKeep treating logic as the guardrail and business judgment as the compass. The analytical discipline you’ve built will make you a trusted advisor in any finance role — from FP&A to strategic planning. Stay curious, keep stressing your models against real-world shocks, and you’ll continue turning complex problems into clear, actionable decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
