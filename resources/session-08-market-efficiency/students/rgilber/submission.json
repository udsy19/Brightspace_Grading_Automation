  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Ryan Gilbert, and in this video I'll be walking you through my DRIVER analysis of the GameStop short squeeze — one of the most fascinating real-world tests of market efficiency in recent history. This project uses the DRIVER framework — Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Explain, and Reflect — to explore how the GameStop event of 2020–2021 challenged traditional views of market behavior. D — DEFINE & DISCOVER To start with the Define stage, my goal was to investigate whether the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH, held up during the GameStop short squeeze. The Efficient Market Hypothesis basically says that stock prices fully reflect all available information. Under the semi-strong form, which I'll focus on here, public information should already be baked into prices — meaning you can't systematically beat the market just by reacting to news. But in early 2021, GameStop — a struggling video game retailer — experienced an unprecedented event. Its stock surged from around four dollars in August 2020 to an intraday high of four hundred eighty-three dollars on January 28th, 2021. That's more than a 100-fold increase, fueled largely by retail traders on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets. Before jumping into analysis, I verified the factual accuracy of one statement from the assignment: that \"GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020.\" That turned out to be incorrect — actual historical data from Yahoo Finance shows GameStop traded around 4 to 6 dollars per share during that time, not 0.04. Documenting this correction first was important, because DRIVER emphasizes starting analysis with verified, accurate data. From there, I defined my research questions: Which form of market efficiency, if any, was violated during this event? How quickly did prices incorporate public information? Could rational investors have profited systematically? And finally, to what extent can behavioral finance explain what happened? R — REPRESENT Moving into the Represent stage, I planned the entire analytical structure before writing any code. My model is a market-adjusted return model, where the abnormal return equals the stock's daily return minus the market's daily return. So mathematically, AR = R_gme – R_market. I then defined two windows: An estimation window from July through December 2020, which captures normal market conditions, and An event window from mid-December 2020 through mid-February 2021, which covers the period leading up to, during, and after the squeeze. The key metrics I planned to analyze were: Daily abnormal returns (AR) Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) Trading volume, to capture investor participation I also noted qualitative factors to review, like Reddit sentiment, brokerage restrictions, and short interest levels. All of this planning was documented in a simple Python dictionary I called \"PLAN,\" which stored the model, metrics, and windows. That made it clear that my Represent stage was fully completed before implementation, which is required by the framework. I — IMPLEMENT Now, in the Implement stage, I began executing the analysis in Python. Here's what the code does, step by step: First, I imported data for both GameStop and the S&P 500 using the yfinance library. I pulled adjusted closing prices and trading volume from June 2020 to March 2021. Next, I calculated daily returns for each stock, merged the datasets, and computed abnormal returns as the difference between GameStop's return and the market's return. Finally, I created a cumulative abnormal return column, or CAR, by summing the ARs across the event window. What this does is isolate how much GameStop's performance deviated from what we'd expect based on the overall market. In simpler terms — if the S&P went up one percent but GameStop went up twenty percent, that extra nineteen percent is the abnormal return. This stage produced the data foundation for all further interpretation. V — VALIDATE The Validate stage is where I checked statistical significance and visualized the results. Using Python's scipy.stats, I performed simple t-tests to see whether the event-day abnormal return was statistically extreme compared to GameStop's normal returns from the estimation period. On January 28, 2021, the abnormal return was roughly +134 percent — more than two standard deviations beyond anything seen before the event. That's astronomically high, and the p-value was effectively zero — meaning this movement was far too large to be explained by normal variation or by the market overall. I also looked at the five-day cumulative abnormal return window from two days before to two days after the event. CAR peaked at around +80 percent, then began to fall as prices corrected. Plotting price, CAR, and trading volume revealed a clear pattern: A vertical spike on January 27th and 28th A huge surge in trading volume — roughly ten times the baseline A steep decline after trading restrictions took effect These visuals validated the quantitative findings and illustrated how abnormal the event was. E — EXPLAIN Now for the Explain stage — this is where we interpret what those numbers actually mean. Market Efficiency Testing: Weak-form efficiency, which assumes prices reflect all past data, was violated because clear momentum patterns appeared. Semi-strong efficiency, which assumes all public info is already priced in, was also violated. Everyone knew about the high short interest and Reddit coordination, yet prices still exploded. Strong-form efficiency, which assumes even insider information is priced in, likely still held — there's no evidence of insider trading advantage. Behavioral Finance: The behavioral side explains much of this better than EMH. Retail investors displayed several key biases: Herding behavior, as thousands of Reddit users coordinated buys Overconfidence, believing they could outsmart institutions Representativeness bias, viewing the trade as a cultural rebellion, not an investment Confirmation bias, where traders focused only on posts supporting their beliefs Social media amplified these biases. The \"diamond hands\" narrative created a collective illusion of control, while limits to arbitrage — like short-sale constraints and brokerage halts — prevented rational investors from correcting the mispricing quickly. Rational Investor Profitability: From a rational standpoint, the opportunity to profit systematically was extremely limited. Ex-ante — meaning before the event — the magnitude and timing were unpredictable. Ex-post — meaning after the fact — we can identify profitable moments, but those can't be reliably replicated. Even those who profited took enormous risk; volatility exceeded 250 percent annualized, and late entrants saw negative risk-adjusted returns. So while some individuals made fortunes, there was no repeatable or systematic way to exploit the inefficiency. R — REFLECT Finally, the Reflect stage focuses on insights, implications, and limitations. From a theoretical perspective, the GameStop case shows that markets can temporarily fail the assumptions of semi-strong efficiency, especially when collective behavior overwhelms fundamentals. However, it also shows that markets are self-correcting. Within weeks, GameStop's price stabilized around 40 to 50 dollars — still above its pre-event levels, but far below the irrational peak. This suggests that efficiency is not binary — it can break down briefly but tends to re-emerge as rational forces return. In terms of management and policy implications: For regulators, this event highlighted the need for clearer transparency around trading restrictions and clearinghouse requirements. For investors, it reinforces the importance of risk management and skepticism toward social-media-driven narratives. And for researchers, it demonstrates that behavioral factors can coexist with efficient markets — efficiency isn't destroyed, it's just interrupted. To wrap up, my analysis found that the GameStop short squeeze represented a temporary violation of the semi-strong form of market efficiency, driven by social media coordination and behavioral biases. Yet, the market corrected itself quickly, showing that while psychology can dominate in the short run, fundamentals still win in the long run. That concludes my DRIVER analysis.
