  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies weak, semi-strong, and strong-form distinctions with concrete examples (use of past price/short-interest data, public-information disconnect, lack of insider info) and discusses mechanisms (short/gamma squeeze, retail coordination). The work is detailed, conceptually thorough, and supported by data-checking and reflective synthesis, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, enumerated research questions, and produced an explicit research plan and data-validation step—satisfying the Define & Discover requirements. The plan, chosen data source, and concrete fact-check demonstrate explicit understanding and readiness to execute the research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly validated primary data against reputable external sources (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, SEC filings) and used those comparisons to correct an erroneous input, meeting the external-validation standard. Although no formal statistical significance tests were reported, the criterion accepts external validation as sufficient, so this requirement is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly collected and verified historical price data and planned an empirical analysis, showing partial readiness for an event study. However, they did not describe or perform key event-study elements (estimation window, benchmark model, abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and interprets information incorporation qualitatively (identifying public-info disconnects and phases of reaction) and collected data for analysis, but did not perform or describe time‑series/event‑study measures of how quickly/accurately prices incorporated specific new information (no AR/CAR, estimation/announcement windows, or statistical inference). That yields a correct but incomplete (partial) treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several key biases (overconfidence, herding, FOMO/ prospect-theory, availability/narrative) with concrete examples and a phase-based interpretation, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for this criterion because anchoring and mental accounting are not explicitly discussed and the behavioral analysis lacks deeper linkage or multiple detailed examples for each listed bias, so it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Trevor — I want to highlight how clearly you’ve embraced the DRIVER mindset. Your project showed disciplined decomposition of the valuation problem: you separated drivers from assumptions, built a logical forecast sequence, and used sensitivity checks to reveal which inputs truly move value. That pattern — isolating cash drivers, articulating assumptions, and tracing impacts — is exactly the shift from reactive tinkering to systematic thinking I look for. Your written rationale for why revenue growth and working capital were the dominant drivers was particularly crisp and business-minded.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening a few financial-concept and integration points so your models speak even more directly to business decisions. Practically:\n- Reconcile accrual vs. cash treatments in one place (a short “assumption validation” sheet). This will prevent misstatements when you translate net income drivers into free cash flow, and it’s essential for capital budgeting discussions.\n- Add a brief, standardized sensitivity table showing NPV/IRR changes to realistic operational levers (price, volume, margin) and a conservative stress scenario tied to plausible macro outcomes. This makes the model actionable for managers deciding on investment or pricing.\n- Where your implementation lagged, insert simple logic checks (e.g., row that sums to zero, automated flag if working capital turns negative). These are small guardrails that improve reliability when models inform financing or M&A conversations.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution partners—not crutches—and document your judgment steps so stakeholders can follow your reasoning. You’re on a trajectory from competent analyst to trusted finance partner; maintain this curiosity and discipline. The DRIVER habits you’re building will compound into career-defining decision-making skills. I’m excited to see what you tackle next."
