  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives a correct, detailed conceptual treatment of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH forms with specific examples (use of past price/short-interest, disconnection from fundamentals, limited role for private information). Their DRIVER work shows rigorous discovery, implementation (data checks), and reflection, meeting the threshold for a thorough, comprehensive discussion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market‑efficiency testing problem (goal, specific questions, and scope) and documented a concrete plan and initial validation steps. These elements meet the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, explicit plan and stepwise layout for analyzing market efficiency, including objectives, staged analysis (data correction → EMH form tests → profitability → behavioral/contextual factors), and concrete implementation steps for data retrieval and validation. These explicit plans and operational steps satisfy the strict Represent requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly gathered and verified historical price data and clearly framed the goal of testing market efficiency, showing basic implementation skills. However, they did not present an event‑study methodology (estimation window, market model or benchmark, abnormal return formulas, cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete and thus earns a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes EMH expectations and uses specific examples (short interest, Ryan Cohen news, price surge and reversion) to discuss speed and accuracy of information incorporation, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform quantitative timing or statistical tests (event‑study metrics, abnormal returns, significance), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student collected and verified raw price data but did not attempt any abnormal‑return or event‑study computations (no returns, market model/benchmark, abnormal return formulas, cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical tests). Under the strict technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of abnormal‑return calculations and personal execution, the submission fails to show the required implementation.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Trevor — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. Your submissions show disciplined problem framing: you consistently start with a crisp decision question, lay out assumptions, and map each finance question to a measurable output. That habit of translating a business problem into a logic-first structure is exactly what turns scattershot intuition into predictable analysis. I also noticed you reliably interpret model outputs in business terms (cash flow implications, break-even tradeoffs), which demonstrates real progress from “math for its own sake” to finance that guides decisions.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will sharpen your impact in real business settings. First, tighten the financial-concept layer: when you model forecasts or valuation drivers, add a short “concept check” for each major assumption (e.g., why revenue growth follows X rather than Y; how working capital days translate to cash flow). Make this a two-line justification in your notebook so stakeholders can quickly audit the logic. Second, strengthen the technical robustness of your workflows: add simple validation routines (sanity checks, bounds on ratios, one-line sensitivity sweeps) and a brief scenario matrix that shows how recommendations change under three plausible business states. These steps don’t require rewriting code — they’re guardrails that make your outputs business-ready and easier to defend with a CFO or PM.\n\nKeep going with this systematic approach. The ability to consistently convert messy business questions into repeatable, explainable analyses will compound in your career: you’ll be the person leadership trusts to turn uncertainty into actionable choices. This is a long game — your progress so far shows you’re on the right path. I’m excited to see how you apply these guardrails to ever more complex finance problems."
