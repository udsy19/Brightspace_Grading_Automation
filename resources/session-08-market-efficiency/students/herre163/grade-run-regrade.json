  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem with clear objectives and detailed research questions (Discover) and showed a direct plan (Represent) to test them, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration. Evidence of implementation and validation further supports that the defined problem drove the analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit plan for analyzing market efficiency (five named steps, tools, and methods), satisfying the strict requirement for Represent. The plan directly maps to the Discover questions and was carried into implementation, demonstrating a well-defined layout suitable for evaluation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, ordered plan and systematically executed it via an automated Python script, producing multiple concrete outputs (console results and image files) that map directly to the planned steps. This demonstrates organized methodological implementation consistent with the DRIVER framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied understanding of weak- and semi-strong-form EMH with concrete tests and interpretation (autocorrelation and CAR), showing practical competency. However, they did not address the strong-form EMH at all (research questions and analysis omit it), so coverage is incomplete and warrants PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented a simplified event study (CAR) and automated the calculations, demonstrating practical understanding. However, the methodology is basic (market-adjusted subtraction) and lacks key rigor (no estimation window, beta/expected-return regression, or significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly understands the concept and implemented a practical event-study (CAR) to assess how quickly markets incorporated public information, demonstrating applied comprehension. However, the methodology is simplified and lacks key rigor (no formal estimation window, model-based expected returns or statistical significance/timing analysis), so the treatment is incomplete and merits PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jose —\n\nI’m really impressed by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER framework as a working habit. You consistently map problems into the DRIVER steps, document assumptions before modeling, and use logic guardrails to keep analyses interpretable — concrete behaviors that mark a shift from reactive tinkering to deliberate problem-solving. Your ability to break a finance question into clear inputs, transformations, and outputs shows the kind of systematic thinking firms pay for when evaluating investment cases or budgeting decisions.\n\nNext steps to build on that momentum: focus on tightening financial concept precision and strengthening integration with business decisions. Practically, when you run valuation or cash-flow models, add a short “finance sanity checklist” for each output — e.g., verify terminal growth vs. macro forecasts, reconcile free cash flow to income statement and balance sheet line items, and flag implausible margin shifts. For technical implementation, formalize a lightweight validation routine (simple sensitivity checks, scenario table, and a couple of edge-case assertions) so your models survive stakeholder scrutiny. For integration, practice converting model outcomes into one-page decision memos: state the actionable insight, the key driver(s), and the recommended next step for the business (hire, delay, cut, invest).\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a lens for business problems, not just an academic exercise. That disciplined habit — framing finance problems, guarding logic, and translating numbers into decisions — will compound in value across roles from FP&A to corporate development. This is a career-long journey, and you’re well on the path. I’m excited to see where you apply this next."
