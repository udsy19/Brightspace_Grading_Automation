  "transcript": "Hello, I'm Jose, and this is my video presentation for Section 6 assignment: Market Efficiency Investigating. I'll be analyzing the GameStop (GME) short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. My entire analysis follows the DRIVER framework as required, and I'll be demonstrating the Python code I used to conduct the financial analysis. First, the Define and Discover stage. The primary objective is to investigate the efficiency of the stock market using the GameStop event. I used this to test GME's price behavior against the predictions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and evaluate whether this event can be explained by rational models or if it requires a behavioral finance framework. A critical first step in this assignment was to verify a specific fact from the prompt. The stated fact was that GameStop traded at $0.04 cents in August 2020. As I demonstrated in the implication stage, my research immediately showed this statement to be incorrect. The actual split-adjusted low price in August 2020 was approximately $1.04. My analysis will therefore proceed using the correct, verified historical data. My key research questions are: What was the actual verified price data for GME? Was Weak-form efficiency violated? Was Semi-strong form efficiency violated? How did the price react to public news like Ryan Cohen's investment or the Reddit posts? What behavioral biases, like herding, were evident? Next, in the Represent stage, I planned my analytical approach to answer my research questions. I used Python for my analysis, using the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for visualization. I implemented this broken down into five steps. First, Fact Verification: Fetch the data for August 2020 to disprove the 4-cent claim. Second, Visualizations: Plot GME's price and volume and annotate key dates to get a visual sense of the event. Third, Volume Analysis: Quantify the \"10-fold increase\" claim mentioned in the prompt. Fourth, Weak-form EMH Test: Plot the autocorrelation of GME's returns. In an efficient market, this should be zero. Fifth, Semi-strong EMH Test: Run a simplified event study by calculating and plotting the Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) around the squeeze. We now move to the Implement stage. I automated all the steps from the Represent stage in the Python script. I will run it now. Great, the script has finished. It printed its findings to the console and generated four image files. Let's review the output. First, Output 1, Data & Fact Verification. As you can see, the console output confirms my finding from the Define stage. The actual lowest split-adjusted price for GME in August 2020 was $1.04, not $0.04. The prompt statement is definitely incorrect. Next is Output 2, Price & Volume. Here is the chart. Here is our adjusted close price. It spikes up here. And then we go to our volume... the visual explosion in both price and, just as importantly, volume is undeniable. Going back to the console for Output 3, the prompt claimed a \"10-fold increase\" in volume. My script calculated the average daily volume from September 2020 and compared it to the squeeze period. The result is an increase of 115.1 times. The 10-fold claim was a massive understatement, and this confirms the huge behavioral, herding-based interest in the stock. For Output 4, the Weak-form EMH Test, the script generated two autocorrelation plots. On the left is the \"Normal Period.\" All the bars are inside the blue shaded area, which means there is no statistical significance; the autocorrelation is effectively zero. This is what a weak-form efficient market looks like. But on the right, during the \"Squeeze Period,\" you can see multiple bars—especially at lag 1—are far outside the blue area. This shows strong positive autocorrelation, meaning a positive return one day was highly likely to be followed by another positive return. This is a clear-cut violation of weak-form market efficiency, driven by momentum and herding. Finally, for Output 5, the Semi-strong Form, the script generated a GME Cumulative Abnormal Returns chart. In a semi-strong efficient market, all public information (like the Reddit short squeeze thesis) should be incorporated into the price almost instantly. If that were true, this line should have been flat after the squeeze began. Instead, the Cumulative Abnormal Returns soar upward for weeks. This severe violation demonstrates that investors who acted on publicly available information were able to earn significant, sustained abnormal returns. Now, the Validate stage. The results from my implementation are conclusive. The visual evidence from the charts directly supports the quantitative findings. These findings are not just statistically significant; they are extreme. They align perfectly with all major financial journalism regarding the GME event. The data and conclusions are valid. In the Evolve stage, I identified how this analysis could be made more robust. My test for abnormal returns was a simple market-adjusted model where I subtracted the S&P 500 return from GME's. A more advanced \"Evolved\" analysis would use the full Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This would involve using a stable estimation period, like 2019, to run a regression of GME's returns against the market's returns to find GME's Beta. Using that Beta, we would calculate the Expected Return during the squeeze. We would then calculate: Abnormal Return equals Actual Return minus Expected Return. This would give us a more academically rigorous measure of the abnormal returns, but I am confident it would lead to the same conclusion. Finally, the Reflect stage. What did we learn? My analysis confirms that the GameStop event represents a significant, temporary breakdown of market efficiency. First, Weak-form EMH was violated: The strong autocorrelation provides evidence of momentum. Second, Semi-strong form EMH was severely violated: The fact that cumulative abnormal returns continued to rise for weeks after the short squeeze thesis became public is the most critical finding. It shows the market failed to incorporate public information instantly. This event is a classic textbook case for behavioral finance. It demonstrates that \"Limits to Arbitrage\" are very real. Short sellers, who are supposed to be the \"rational actors\" correcting the price, were instead forced to complete a buyback, pushing the price even further from its fundamental value. The event was driven by behavioral biases like herding and overconfidence, all coordinated and amplified by the new technology of social media. My reflection is that markets are mostly efficient, but they are not always efficient, and certainly not perfectly efficient. The GME event was a perfect storm where behavioral factors fueled by technology completely overwhelmed rational fundamental valuation. This concludes my driver analysis. Thank you for watching.",
