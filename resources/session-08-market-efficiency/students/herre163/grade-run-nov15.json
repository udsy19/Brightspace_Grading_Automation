  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines a clear research problem and specific, testable research questions and demonstrates initial discovery by verifying a key factual claim—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. The scope and focus are appropriate for market-efficiency testing and would enable reproducible analysis, so this criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, explicit framework tailored to event-based efficiency testing (five named steps including an event-study/CAR), links it to the research questions, and reports executing the plan—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, planned methodology and systematically executed each step (automated data fetch, volume metric, autocorrelation, and CAR visualization), producing multiple concrete outputs and interpreting them. Missing advanced robustness (e.g., CAPM) is acknowledged but does not undermine that the event-study workflow was implemented systematically, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied understanding of weak- and semi-strong-form EMH with concrete tests and interpretation (Implement and Reflect stages). However, they do not address or discuss the strong-form EMH at all, so coverage is incomplete; therefore the work meets PARTIAL rather than the THOROUGH standard required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented a basic event-study approach (market-adjusted returns and CAR) and automated it, showing applied understanding (Discover + Implement). However, the treatment is simplified and omits key event-study specifics (estimation window, model specification, statistical inference on abnormal returns), and the student themselves recommends but did not perform the more rigorous CAPM/regression approach—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied a basic event-study approach and interpreted prolonged CAR as evidence that public information was not incorporated instantly, demonstrating conceptual understanding (Discover + Implement + Reflect). However, the methodology is simplified (market-adjusted only) and lacks rigorous timing/statistical inference (estimation window, model specification, significance testing), so the treatment is incomplete and merits PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jose —\n\nI’ve really noticed how your thinking has shifted from scattered ideas to clear, explainable logic. The way you now narrate a valuation or cash‑flow scenario — laying out assumptions, walking through cause and effect, and choosing which metrics matter for a stakeholder — is one of your biggest strengths. That clarity makes you a reliable communicator in group work and client-facing settings: you don’t just produce numbers, you translate them into business meaning.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact. You’ve shown progress on several financial concepts, but tighten a few foundational areas that matter in real business decisions. Practical actions:\n- When you build a projection, explicitly reconcile your assumptions to a business driver (e.g., customer growth → revenue mix → unit economics). Keep a one‑page “assumption ledger” so reviewers can see how a change in a rate ripples to EBITDA.\n- For technical gaps that remain, focus on validating outputs rather than rewriting code: run sensitivity checks, backtest a simple historical scenario, and annotate where model behavior deviates from expectations. These are the same routines financial analysts use to defend forecasts in meetings.\n- To deepen integration between finance and tools, practice packaging your analysis into a short decision memo: recommendation, key numbers, sensitivity, and next steps. That format maps directly to board discussions and investment memos.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that matters. Systematic thinking is a competitive skill — it lets you turn ambiguity into actionable choices for managers and investors. Treat this as iterative craftsmanship: each project, memo, and sanity check compounds your judgment. Keep pushing the “assumption → test → translate” loop, and you’ll be the kind of finance professional who shapes decisions, not just reports them.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
