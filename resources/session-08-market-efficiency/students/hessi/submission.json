  "transcript": "Hello, this is for the section six assignment looking at market efficiency. Um, and essentially we are investigating this market efficiency using GameStop um as this case study from 2020 to 2021. So essentially we need to verify the stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to the market predictions, evaluate um if the evidence is against the market efficiency or can be explained within these existing frameworks and then yeah so essentially we have a couple things we need to answer. So our first step would be to verify if the statement that GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020. Um if this is correct and we have some timeline here key data points required analysis with um the things we need to answer for the assignment. So go ahead and starting off with the driver framework. The our first task is to verify if the statement that GameStop traded at $0 um and 4 cents and August 20, 2020 was correct. And so for that was for the define stage the research so driver um using this historical data it shows that having the share price is very low and highly unlikely for a publicly traded stock. Um and this actually was incorrect. So the actual GME price in August of 2020 traded between $4 and $6.50 per share during that time frame. So our first step to go back to the assignment um this is not correct verifying that. So, a good way to kind of talk to the professor about this correction would be to address it clearly and politely. So, um you know, noticing a small discrepancy in the timeline, the price in August of 2020 was $4 to $6.50 and not um $04. So then again just kind of making that reassurance. So saying that it doesn't change the essence of the short squeeze case study but um but I did want to document this in discrepancy and showcase the actual figures that relate to that. For the second part of this assignment here for the required analysis testing which form of the market efficiency was violated. So determining for a defined stage with this particular question would be to determine which EMH um efficient market form was violated by the stock and by the price movement. So stating in our research stage that the squeeze was driven by the public sentiment on Reddit leading to a massive spike from $20 in early January to $483 at the peak um and then having the price exceeded um in this this statement. Interpreting this we will say that it for the weak form the price changes were based on public historical trading data. Um and the technical analysis shouldn't necessarily yield systematic profits. Um and then the initial rise was not purely based off of the past price action. And for the semi- strong form the price reflects all of the public information. So, financial reports, news, um, analysis reports, all of that. And the peak price was $483, which vastly ignored the publicly available fundamental value of $10 to $40. So, this would be a violation of this one before. For the weak form, it was unclear if it was necessarily violating it, but the semi- strong format is um due to the fact that the publicly available um information was ignored. And then the strong form. So price reflects all information public plus private slash insider sector and stating that no one not even the insiders could trade um could profit systematically and this would be in violation of this um as the extreme price suggests the market was not rationally incorporating all of the relevant information into this. So it would be in violation of the strong form. And then for our verify stage, the driver um most clearly violated the semi-trong form um because the stock price roughly $483 severely decoupled from the publicly available fundamental value of $10 to $40. So there was a very clear discrepancy between those values um which is the most prominent out of the violation for the forms. And then overall this suggests that during the hard behavior markets can fail to rationally incorporate public fundamental data. So just our evolve stage taking Matt's piece and incorporating it on a higher level. The third question of this assignment. So evaluate whether the rational investors could have profited systematically. So one bases the decision solely off of intrinsic value and risk. So we could have made use the GME the GameStop anomaly to make the systematic risk adjusted profits within the research stage or um the price surged to $483 which exceeded the fundamental value of 10 to 40 like we addressed before. and was a um speculative kind of bubble. So interpreting this a rational investor, excuse me, would short sell the stock. Um however, the short squeeze phenomenon created the unlimited risk for the short sellers. And then to answer the question, so no, a rational investor could not really have profited systematically off of this while the trader guessed the peak and profited. A rational strategy was based off the intrinsic value or the shorting which exposed them to the extreme unquantifiable and ultimately unsustainable risk due to the unique shorts dynamic. And then the systematic profits relies on predictive price correlation which was impossible at the time. So to answer that question, no, just because of the unreliability and the short squeeze kind of dynamic as a whole. And then this risk profile of the squeeze um transformed a fundamentally rational trade. So shorting an overvalued asset into a highly speculative gamble um which prevents the systematic profit. So it doesn't necessarily align very well and it has kind of conflicting um views. So leads to no for the for the question there on whether investors could have profited systematically and then again so comparing efficient market hypothesis predictions to observed behavior. Let's take a look here. So essentially we're comparing the um market expectations to what actually happened with the GameStop. So for the research phase, the prediction was that the price should have reflected the fundamental value. Again, the $10 to $40. Um, and the new information that's investment should lead to a small immediate price adjustment and the shock should follow a random walk, which essentially is unpredictable price change around its true values. That's the prediction for the for the efficient market hypothesis. Now, our observed behavior for the interpret part of driver was that the price sparked to $483 um driven by the coordinated retail buying creating a massive short squeeze event. Not based on fundamental information, the price was not close to its true value. So definitely not um following our prediction very well at all. Verify prediction versus observation. So the officially efficient market predicted a failure of the price um to stay at the $483 which eventually crashed um and it failed to predict the extreme magnitude and duration of the anomaly and the massive decoupling from fundamental value is the core contradiction and then evolve stage. So the event shows that the markets are conditionally affected or efficient under extreme coordinated pressure and high short intense market mechanisms break down allowing price to disconnect drastically from um fundamentals. So just again reinstating how the prediction in the behavior was quite off. And lastly to go to this assessing the behavioral finance explanations for those observed anomalies. So identifying those behavioral biases that explain the price surge and the sustainment. So going back to what we had just talked about. So researched the R stage and driver um the key drivers through this Reddit community, the Wall Street Bets community, social media hype coordinated action against the establishment. So or the hedge funds. So it was very kind of hyped up to more what it was and then interpreting this so they're hurting behavior or social proof. the retailer traders found followed the crowd on Reddit believing the collective ashen was rational. So really just hurting all of those behaviors having a specific like quote unquote ring leader somebody who really encourages the rest of the people to follow their movements and to do what they're doing. Then also too we have some confirmation bias. So really focusing only on the positive Reddits and ignoring the fundamental risks and values, the gamblers policy or sensation seeking. So treating the market as a casino or as a game um driven by that that thrill and potential for those gains rather than seeing the really risk um return profiles. So more paying attention to the what they could be receiving instead of the risk the sentiment and mood. So having a strong collective anti-wall street sentiment fueled the meme stock movement which overrided the traditional analysis. So kind of tying back to that hurting behavior just kind of getting everybody on the same page making it out to be something that it's not necessarily is. And then overall the behavioral finance um provides a strong explanation. The anomaly was driven by this investor settlements social coordination and cognitive biases rather than the rational fundamental analysis or directly challenging the efficient market um hypothesis assumption of those rational agents. So kind of ignoring all that rationality and just going with the flow. Then as a whole the biases created a large temporary price bubble or anomalies um that were eventually corrected which suggested a middle ground essentially that the markets were mostly efficient but prone to those behavioral um bubbles. So to answer all of those questions, I then created a Python code in Google Collab just kind of visually stating what um went down in this market for GameStop. So again, just to really drive this visual representation through the driver stage, the um the visualization shows the massive spike for the exceeding the estimated fundamental value of like $25. And then the demonstrates a significant violation of the semi- strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Excuse me. So we'll see here this blue line representing the stock itself or the GameStop and really exceeding that around um this area here. So the estimated fundamental value was roughly $25. This is a red dotted line here and the start of the major squeeze is this green line here. So we this is where we really start to see things shift and change as you can tell from the data showcasing that very massive um spike. So the actual price was between $4 and $6. And this visual representation really does demonstrate that. Um comparing it to the stated claim that it was being traded at less than a dollar in August of 2020. Well, we're able to see that here. And obviously that still wasn't very correct, but then we see this massive spike over here. Just again really taking that visualization um or representation of how kind of inaccurate that was and the anomaly itself of having these biases and paying more attention to the potential return rather than the risk and just showcasing what inaccuracies really can do. when we are measuring all of this this data and um yeah again just kind of showcasing those markets and what can can go wrong when they're not necessarily efficient. So thanks and uh have a good night.",
