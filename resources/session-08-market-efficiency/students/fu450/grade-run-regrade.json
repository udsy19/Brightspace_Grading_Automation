  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (purpose, research questions) and provides concrete scope, timeframe, and verification rules, satisfying the strict requirement for Define & Discover. The plan and methods are clearly articulated, demonstrating a complete and defensible problem definition.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem scope, timeframe, research questions, and a clear, ordered methodology for testing market efficiency (data verification, plots, abnormal/CAR calculations, short-interest and volume comparisons). These elements meet the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage and provide a defensible plan for analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, ordered plan and produced multiple implementation outputs (model estimates, graphs, abnormal-return findings) consistent with their Represent stage. Although they used AI to produce code, they executed the analysis end-to-end, reported results, and validated key data—meeting the criterion for systematic implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly situates the analysis within the EMH framework and applies relevant empirical methods, showing conceptual understanding of testing semi-strong efficiency (Implement + Discover). However, treatment is brief and lacks thorough, explicit discussion of the three EMH forms (weak, semi-strong, strong) and deeper examples or distinctions, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements core event-study steps (market model, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and reports findings, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks methodological detail (estimation/event window choices, benchmark index, statistical significance, robustness) and thorough documentation of calculations, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual understanding and applies event-study tools relevant to measuring how markets incorporate information (Discover + Implement). However, the submission lacks critical methodological detail and timing-specific analysis (estimation/event windows, statistical tests, intraday timing, robustness), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Ivy — I want to celebrate how thoroughly you've adopted the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently break problems into clear drivers, build repeatable logic guardrails, and use hypothesis‑driven experiments to validate assumptions. In your last project I noticed crisp decomposition (revenue drivers separated by customer cohort), reproducible model steps, and disciplined use of checks that prevented flawed conclusions — concrete signs your \"monkey mind\" is becoming systematic. You also show a healthy habit of using AI as an execution assistant to iterate faster, not as a shortcut.\n\nNext steps to convert that momentum into business-ready finance work:\n- Tighten financial-concept accuracy by linking each model assumption to a specific financial statement impact (e.g., how a price change flows to gross margin, operating leverage, and free cash flow). For any assumption, add a short footnote citing the source or rationale.\n- Strengthen technical implementation by adding simple validation layers: run sensitivity sweeps, add sanity-check rows (percent-of-sales, industry benchmarks), and keep a lightweight changelog so you can trace how a number moved during iterations.\n- Deepen integration of finance and tech by practicing scenario narratives: for each scenario, write a one-paragraph recommendation for a CFO (action, trigger, timing) that ties model outputs to capital allocation or pricing decisions.\n- Improve communication by distilling models into two slides: 1) key drivers and model structure, 2) five takeaways with confidence levels and recommended next actions.\n\nKeep going — you’re on the path to becoming the kind of finance professional who not only builds models but reliably informs decisions. This is a long, compounding journey; your systematic habits are the most valuable asset you’re developing. I’m excited to see how you translate these next steps into business impact."
