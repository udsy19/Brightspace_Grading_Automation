  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the testing problem, timeframe, research questions, and a concrete methodological plan (data verification, time-series plots, AR/CAR calculations and validation rules). Those explicit elements satisfy the strict Define & Discover requirements for a defensible research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student laid out a clear, event-focused analytical framework with defined scope, explicit procedures for measuring abnormal and cumulative returns, complementary market-micro metrics, and validation criteria—satisfying the strict Represent requirement for a defensible research design. While lower-level parameter choices (exact estimation/event-window lengths) could be added, the framework itself is explicit and actionable.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, organized event-study workflow from data verification through modeling and visualization, produced multiple quantitative outputs (price correction, volume multiplier, AR/CAR conclusion), and validated findings against external sources. While some low-level methodological choices (exact estimation/event-window lengths, test statistics) could be documented more fully, the submission shows systematic execution of the planned event-study methodology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames EMH testing and implements an event-study approach that targets semi-strong efficiency, demonstrating conceptual understanding and applied method. However, treatment is not thorough across all EMH forms (weak and strong forms are not clearly defined or deeply analyzed), so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements an event-study approach conceptually (model, alpha/beta, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and reports an interpretation. However, the submission lacks methodological detail and reporting of results/statistical tests (estimation window, model specification, numeric AR/CAR and significance), so understanding is present but not thoroughly demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual understanding and uses appropriate methods (event-study, AR/CAR, volume/time-series) to assess information incorporation, but the treatment lacks key methodological and timing details (estimation/event windows, statistical significance, intraday timing) needed for a thorough assessment of how quickly and accurately information was reflected.

  "personalized_feedback": "Ivy — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve moved from scattered brainstorming to purposeful, stepwise analysis. You consistently decomposed complex problems into DRIVER-aligned pieces (data, validate, iterate, report), and your explanations tied model inputs to business logic — for example, when you mapped demand assumptions to revenue drivers and called out which variables would most change the outcome. That concrete linking of numbers to commercial levers shows real growth in systematic thinking.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will pay immediate dividends in real finance work. First, tighten your technical implementation by adding structured validation and sensitivity checks: explicitly document key assumptions, run high/low scenarios for the top 3 drivers, and include simple sanity tests (e.g., margin bounds, sales per customer ranges). These are the guardrails that make a model usable for managers. Second, deepen the integration of outputs with business metrics: translate scenario results into cash-flow timing, working-capital needs, or NPV impacts so stakeholders can see the funding and value implications. Concretely, add a one-page “decision memo” that states the recommended action, the critical assumption that would change it, and the trigger for revisiting the recommendation.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as an iterative practice rather than a checklist. Your ability to structure problems already sets you apart — with routine habit of validating assumptions and tying results to KPIs, you’ll make faster, more defensible decisions in any finance role. This is a journey; keep pushing small, repeatable improvements and lean on peers and AI as execution partners. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
