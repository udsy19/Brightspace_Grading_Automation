  "personalized_feedback": "Abdulrahman—\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a clearer, stepwise approach. You’ve shown curiosity and persistence: your assignments consistently break big finance questions into smaller pieces, you document assumptions, and you’ve begun using AI as an execution partner rather than a crutch. Those are concrete signs your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker—your work now reads like someone building a decision tool, not just producing numbers.\n\nNext steps (practical, business-focused):\n- Translate the five financial concepts that need tightening into decision checkpoints. For each concept (for example: cash-flow linkage, discounting logic, risk adjustments), write a one-line business question it answers (e.g., “Will this project increase free cash flow enough to cover incremental cost of capital?”). Use that as your acceptance test before trusting a model.\n- Build one simple business case end-to-end: 3-year projections, WACC estimate, NPV/sensitivity table, and a 3-bullet CFO memo that links model outputs to a hiring or capex decision. That forces you to connect theory to action.\n- Strengthen verification: add a lightweight checklist (assumptions sanity, units consistent, edge-case test, alternate scenario). Run at least two scenario runs and capture the driver causing the largest outcome swing.\n- Improve explanations: Practice turning model results into a 90-second executive summary that highlights the decision, key sensitivities, and recommended next step.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as your cognitive scaffold—define assumptions up front, instrument checks into your model, and always close with a crisp business recommendation. This journey is cumulative: each small iteration makes you faster and more trustworthy to stakeholders. I’m excited to see how you turn these next steps into habits—keep going, and bring me your next model for a quick review."
