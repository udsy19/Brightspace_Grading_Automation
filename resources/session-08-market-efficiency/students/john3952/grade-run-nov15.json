  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and coherently distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them to concrete GameStop facts (short interest, trading restrictions, speed of price response). They also outline an appropriate event-study implementation and acknowledge frictions that reconcile observed anomalies with EMH, meeting the threshold for a thorough, conceptually grounded treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student lays out a complete, appropriate event-study methodology (windows, market model/CAPM beta estimation, abnormal return and cumulative calculations, significance testing, and sensitivity checks) and attempted implementation. Given the MODERATE standard allowing conceptual demonstration and the specific, actionable design and planned tests, this meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains how to evaluate how quickly and accurately markets incorporate information (theoretical expectations, mechanisms like microstructure bottlenecks) and provides a concrete event-study design (windows, sensitivity checks, AR/CAR computation). Given the MODERATE standard allowing conceptual demonstration plus a specific empirical plan and discussion of limitations, this meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions social amplification/herding and discusses retail outcomes, and sets up tests that could capture behavioral patterns, but does not explicitly treat the full set of biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) with specific examples or mechanisms. This is a correct but incomplete conceptual treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and links momentum/reversal patterns to the GME episode and proposes an empirical event-study to detect them, but does not discuss value, size, or calendar anomalies or provide depth on those effects. This is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes the CAPM-based AR methodology but does not demonstrate successful personal execution, provide outputs, or explain code blocks and calculations; instead they report runtime errors and reliance on an AI assistant. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit, owned implementation and verification, this is a failure.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Gillian — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You consistently break problems into decision-focused layers, state explicit assumptions before modeling, and use AI as an execution partner rather than a black box. In your last assignment I noticed crisp problem framing, logical guardrails around choices, and clean documentation of trade-offs — all signs that your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker who can explain not just what a number is, but why it matters.\n\nFor next steps, focus on the technical-implementation piece as a way to make your analysis actionable in real business settings. Concretely:\n- Convert your logical steps into reproducible calculations (simple spreadsheets or step-by-step worked examples) so a finance manager can trace from assumption to output.\n- Add validation checks: spot-test extremes, compare model outputs to simple heuristics (e.g., quick back-of-envelope checks), and flag when inputs push results outside reasonable ranges.\n- Tie outputs to decisions a CFO would make: how does a sensitivity in revenue growth change working-capital needs, funding timing, or covenant risk? Produce one scenario table that maps input changes to those business KPIs.\n\nKeep building the bridge between financial intuition and technical rigor. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it makes your analyses defensible in meetings and scalable across projects. This is a long arc — you’re well past the starting line. Keep iterating on those reproducible checks and decision-connection steps, and you’ll transform solid insight into trusted financial advice. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
