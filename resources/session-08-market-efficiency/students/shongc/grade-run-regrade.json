  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies each to the GME case with examples (momentum, short-interest, insider/private information), showing both theoretical understanding and empirical intent. Their DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT progression and the nuanced conclusion demonstrate thorough, well-supported treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear event-study approach: defines AR and CAR, justifies using a market-adjusted model (SPY) instead of CAPM given extreme returns, and documents data collection and plotting to validate results. The methodological description, data sourcing, and claimed validation show a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly addresses speed and accuracy of information incorporation (claims of instant incorporation of short-interest/social signals) and provides a concrete event-study plan (AR/CAR, market-adjusted model) plus claimed validation of timing via CAR. Combined DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT steps show a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies AR/CAR methodology, justifies using a market-adjusted model, and states they downloaded data and produced/validated a CAR plot, showing partial technical implementation. However, they do not provide explicit code blocks, run outputs, block-by-block explanations, or clear ownership/verification statements required under the STRICT technical standard, so the demonstration is incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Christine — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve matured into a systematic thinker. Your assignments consistently demonstrated correct application of core financial concepts (valuation logic, risk-return tradeoffs, and capital budgeting) and you integrated technology thoughtfully — your use of structured spreadsheets and AI as an execution assistant showed you understand tools are guardrails, not the goal. Most impressive was your adherence to the DRIVER framework: you decomposed problems, framed assumptions explicitly, traced impacts through to decisions, and communicated results in a way a CFO could act on. That level of logic-first thinking is exactly what transforms “monkey mind” impulse solutions into reliable business advice.\n\nNext steps to leverage that momentum: translate your clear analyses into repeatable decision processes. Practical actions you can take this term:\n- Build a simple scenario library (base / upside / downside) for one case study and map the decision triggers (when to accelerate investment, when to pause). This connects directly to capital allocation conversations in real firms.\n- Add structured sensitivity checks and a short “what would change my recommendation” section to each memo — this makes your analysis board-ready.\n- Continue the progress you’ve shown in technical implementation by documenting assumptions and outputs in one place (a one-page model spec or checklist). That practice makes your work auditable for controllers and useful for cross-functional teams.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as a muscle to train, not a badge to earn. As you apply DRIVER to real business problems — forecasting for a business unit, preparing an investment memo, or advising a product launch — you’ll find the clarity you create accelerates both decisions and trust. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
