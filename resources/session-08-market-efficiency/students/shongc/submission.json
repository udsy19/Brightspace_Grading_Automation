  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Christine Xiong and this is my session 8 assignment. Our primary mission for this assignment is to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop GME event. This requires us to test the claims made in the assignment overview against objective verifiable data. and um our first critical step here we see is to verify the statement that gamestop traded at 0.04 cents in august 2020 against actual historical data if incorrect document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor so the information we have is the event timeline from august 2020 to the present or february 2021 congressional hearings on market manipulation and the key data points of short interest peaked and the analyst fundamental values estimating from 10 to 40 dollars per share and required um analysis we'll get to um and so like i said the first task that we need to do in this assignment is to verify the specific statement that game stock traded at 0.04 cents in august 2020. initial discovery and data cross-referencing a preliminary review of available data immediately flags this as a potential error data from market sources covering 2020 to 2021 shows a 52 week low for gme of 20.73 while historical charts show an all-time high um all -time high of 483 dollars no data suggests a price level of 0.04 there is a simple code that um um that shows as um the code where you put yf finance which is directly imports financial data from yahoo finance onto google collab and so we by using that um yes we use the yf library imported we call it a ticker function and then it creates a special ticker object a bundle of data and functions right from yahoo finance like i said and um with all that it gives you his growth historical data for gme in august 2020 and therefore the lowest price was in august 2020 which was one dollar which occurred on 2020 of august 3rd this statement gamestop traded at 0.04 uh four cents in august 2020 is highly incorrect and that was just a script of it and um import yfin is as yf yes and pandas is pd yes yes yes it is just is the same code as the one above where the ticker of the GameStop or GME like was at $1 not 0.04 cents and this is just a historical data that you get with the code I got we just downloaded data this is the price first volume disconnect the downloaded data for gme and spy for the period of 2019 to 2021 which we can see right here from august 2020 to february 2021 just the entirety and then to make the chart we just um isolated that adjacent close and volume data and um yeah um one source like um it showed like um in its daily market summary shows a line item of negative 0.04 cents uh a negative point zero negative point zero negative 0.04 negative 0.19 percent another source clarifies this stating gamestop traded at 21 dollars 40 and 45 cents decreasing 0.04 cents or zero decreasing 0.04 cents or 0.19 percent this demonstrates that 0 .04 cents was a daily price change a delta not an absolute price level the most probable source of the error in the assignment prompt is a common data reading mistake misinterpreting the change column in a stock table as a low or close column and to conclude that statement the statement gamestop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 is factually incorrect like I stated within the data we see that it's one dollar not four cents um and we will continue to verify this in the implementation stage where the actual price of the GME in August 2020 was like around like four dollars to six dollars range and to note that these are like pre-stock split prices all prices in this report will be adjusted for consistency and then um the communication strategy uh and to say like um that this prompt mentions to go to go forth with what my professor said to go with like how four cents is the price they traded at in august 2020 and within the historical data we could see that um i am finding that the actual closing price for gme during that month was in the four dollar four to five dollar range. And interestingly enough, I defined several data sources that list four cents as a daily price change. That's one, and this is two. As a daily price change, a delta for GME, I suspect this might be the source of the figure. For the purpose of the analysis, I'll proceed by documenting the discrepancy in my driver analysis as required using the usual historical closing price from a reliable data source Yahoo! Finance import as we see like I said and as the correct August 2020 baseline for my analysis and then now we must verify the other foundational facts of the event sure interest peaked at 140% we see that right here sure key data points that we need to uncover um this is verified this is the central objective catalyst for the entire event multiple academic and journalistic sources confirmed that the short interest in gme exceeded its public float peaking at approximately 140 this physical impossibility more shares short shorted than available to trade created the tinderbox for the squeeze the melvin um capital sustained 53 percent loss which is verified the hedge fund melvin capital which held a large short position suffered catastrophic losses reports from january 2021 confirmed the fund lost 53 percent of its asset under management required two dollars and 75 cents billion bailout from other funds katadol and 0.72 i'm sorry if i'm pronouncing it wrong um this quantifies extreme limits to arbitrage risk and then in january 2021 uh the reddit um our wall street bets driven price search to 483 dollars this is also verified this was the intraday high price pre-market value briefly hit over 500 reached on january 28 2021 this is the peak of the anomaly and the analyst fundamental value estimating at $10 to $40 per share this is also verified as a reasonable synthesis of the pre -squeeze consensus no single source gives this exact range but it is strongly supported um morning stars quantitative price versus fair value chart for 2020 shows a fair value estimate in the $10-$20 range. Analysts target for 2020-2021 were low with many downgrades, examples from buy to sell. One 2026 price target based on fundamentals is $13.77. The general consensus was that GMB's price was difficult to reconcile with. Fundamental value, the $10-$40 range accurately represents the fundamental anchor from which the price became detached uh now we define the core financial theories um theories um the efficient market hypothesis um emh um in its simplest form posits that asset prices fully reflect all available information um this implies that it is impossible to like beat the market systematically the theory has three forms and the gme event tests all of them number one the weak form which is prices reflect all past market data the historical prices and trading volume implication is that technical analysis is useless and the gme test is the first form we will test did the gme price movements show predictable patterns the massive price run up on high volume is a momentum effect which is a no market anomaly some studies concluded that the gme returns were not randomly distributed suggesting a clear violation of the weak form emh semi -strong form number two semi-strong form which is basically a process reflect all publicly available information like news earnings report analyst ratings and crucially social media posts etc the implications of these are that both technical analysis and fundamental analysis um for example reading financial statements are useless the only way to gain an edge is with like private information from inside and the gme test is that that we got is that this is the central battleground of our entire analysis um the gme event presents as a paradox on one hand it's like a massive violation that the price of 483 dollars was completely disconnected from the fundamental public information for example like gme's 10q filing which showed a 295.8 million net loss on the other hand it might be like a hyper efficient thing the price instantly and brutally reflected a new kind of public information that like 140 percent short interest data and the collective intent of our wall street's bets to exploit it our analysis and explore this like kind of once and last but not least number three a strong form which is a prices reflect all information both public and private for example like information known only to company insiders um and the application is that nobody can systematically beat the market and using the gme test this form is widely considered false in reality due to insider trading laws the gme event is no exception any investor with private knowledge of melvin um capital's portfolio or the precise timing of the wall street's bets could have profited enormously this form is considered disproven uh and then our like core concept two which is behavioral finance um this school of thought in contrast to emh argues that investors are not rational it posits that psychological and cognitive biases can and do cause prices to deviate from their fundamental values for extended periods gme is a textbook case uh let's see what else do i hmm um key biases that are identify hurting and hurting stinked um this is when investors follow the crowd instead of their own analysis it is often driven by fear of missing out fomo the r wall street's best forum acted as a powerful high -speed mechanism for this hurting behavior and the overconfidence bias disbias occurs when investors have inflated sense of their own abilities um it manifested on both sides of the gme trade hedge funds and overconfidence in the short thesis leading them to take a short position greater than 100 of the float and retail traders a belief that there were above average and could collectively beat wall street professionals anchoring biases is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information information such as price purchase price or peak price this bias helps explain the extreme volatility after the peak investors who bought at 400 may have anchored to that price refusing to sell at 150 contributing to volatility yes and then another core concept we have is to limit to arbitrage this theory is to bridge that reconciles emh and behavioral finance the question is that if gme was obviously overpriced at 483 dollars like it says here in january 21 why didn't rational investors simply short sell it and force the price back down to its 10 and 40 to 40 fundamental value and um and to answer that question it's because in the real world arbitrage is not free it's incredibly risky um the gme event is a perfect illustration of these limits and these identified limits are um because it's a fundamental risk and noise trader risk and market microstructure issues to briefly explain all three of them the fundamental risk is like a small risk that the short sellers were wrong and that ryan cohen could actually turn gamestop around to the noise trader risk is the key limit um it is the risk that irrational traders like the r wall street bets herd can remain irrational longer than the arbitrator can remain solvent and um short sellers face infinite potential losses the gme short squeeze is the textbook example of noise trader risk culminating in melvin capital's 53 percent loss then market microstructure issues uh the initial view manipulation this was widely seen by the public as a market manipulation to save the hedge funds and a deeper analysis is um that we get is a systematic failure and the conclusion of all this is that the halt was the ultimate limit to arbitration the plumbing of the market itself broke it demonstrates that the market is not frictionless a core and false assumption of pure emh and to fact check what's the true price of gme in august 2020 what was the true price of gme in august what is the likely source of the four cents discrepancy um does a visual and quantitative analysis of gme's price and volume data show evidence of momentum or non-random patterns that violate the weak form emh and and so on so on more more more more questions um that we'll get to um the core of our quantitative oh yes this would probably explain better i should have put this on that's completely my bad but um this table is not just a history lesson it is like our primary and analytical tool it isolates the specific dates we will test in our implement stage it allows us to classify the type of information the market was processing um for example like the fundamental versus the sentiment versus market structure this classification is essential for testing the semi-strong emh um for the expected result like i said for the beginning um moving in with the spy line throughout 2019 and most of 2020 then in january 2021 the jeremy line will go vertical um right here that we see i'll go vertical completely detached from spy the volume chart bottom panel will show a massive um um corresponding spike at the exact same time and which is we'll call this exhibit a um our goal is to quantify the anomaly we will calculate gme's abnormal return the ar the formula is abnormal return equals actual return minus the put it the expected return this is the key methodological step of complex approach would use the capital asset pricing model which calculates expected return based on beta and the risk-free rate. We will not use CAPM if it violates it. The GME returns are so enormous, like example, plus 100 % in a single day that the marginal difference between the CAPM expected return, example, 0 .1% and a simple market return, example, of 0.2% is completely irrelevant. We use the market adjusted model. We'll define GME's expected return as simply the return of the market on that day, SPI returns equals SPI data, close PCT change. Now we see here, the goal is to see the total accumulative effect of the anomaly over time. And the formula we use is car equals some abnormal returns over our event window. and the code is car equals a normal return comes sum. To plot our car from this code right here, we're time and see exactly what occurred. We will plot the car line. We will then add vertical lines for our key and then the expected we will see the car line bounce around zero noise for all of 2019 and 2020. This proves our model is stable and GME is stable and GME on an average day performed as expected. Then around January 13, 2020, we will see the car line go vertical, confirming the mass of sudden injection of positive abnormal returns. This chart will be exhibit B, which is here. Which you can't see because it's blocking it but there's a hint of a line right there where it skyrockets up there section one price volume charts from Exhibit A As a primary evidence to structure our written analysis for The B form image analysis We will argue that the clear visual evidence of momentum effect massive price search on high volume that continues for days is a violation of the weak form emh which states past price patterns cannot predict future returns um you will use the car event from exhibit b um right here as our primary evidence we will present um this is for semi -strong form emh analysis uh two interpretation we discovered indeed to the inefficient view and an nuanced efficiency view um the inefficient view the price of 483 dollars was a clear failure of market efficiency as it did not reflect the fundamental public information uh the nuanced efficiency view the market was efficient it instantly and brutally incorporated a new form of public information the 140 short interest data and the collective public intent of walsh reached bets to exploit it um we will argue the information that emh says it reflected in the price is not just fundamental information but any information that affects supply and demand in this case sentiment and fund flows and the strong form emh analysis this will be a consensual argument we will state that the event disproves strong form efficiency as any investor with private knowledge example a melvin capital employee of the over leveraged short positions could have ended like keith gill albeit with public data achieve systematic abnormal returns and to represent this is where we combine the financial theories to build our final conclusions for the evolve and reflect stages so in the section one behavioral financing so we will use this volume spike in it exhibit a right here the volume spikes the bottom data as a quantitative evidence of hurting we will use reddit media quotes and the state of wall street bets as a qualitative evidence overconfidence and hurting we will use the post peak volatility to discuss anchoring investors anchored to the 483 dollars high leading to erratic trading and the rational investor profitability analysis we will use the car plot in um subit b to show that x post after the fact enormous once in a lifetime profits were made um we will however differentiate the initial thesis uh key skills based on fundamental essential interest was a rational ex ante value arbitrage investment the mania that followed the january 2021 spike was a speculative exposed lottery and then last but not least implications um the activist passive we will argue gme is a powerful argument for passive The event highlights catastrophic non-fundamental firms, specific risks that active managers, both long and short, were exposed to. In policy implications, we will discuss SEC's official report that key issues are not just Reddit, but gamification of trading platforms, payment for order floor, PFOF, transparency, and short selling, market plumbing, and T plus two settlement cycles. um yes all that it gives you the rundown from the code what it means so this was generally just to um visualize the price and volume disconnect um and exhibit a if the price is kind of volume link and um the chart is a valid representation it visually validates the link between the anomalous price the what and the surge and retail trading the why and then in exhibit b it was to generate to quantify the abnormal returns over time which you can see like all the dates and stuff i don't not gonna i could scroll all the way down yeah just a lot a bunch um the car plot is validated it confirms that the profile market anomaly occurred exactly when we expected it this model was a successful in isolating and quantifying it um and last but not least we have like evolve um our court um like how do our findings apply to the broader world of finance what are the second and third order implications of our validated analysis the gme even provides like a powerful real world case study for the active versus passive debate um the primary lesson for melvin capitol's 53 percent loss is that noise for trader risk um it's not just an academic theory but a real portfolio destroying force the risk of shorting um was realized in the most brutal way the market's irrationality outlasted the rational short seller solvency against active long picking the gme event was also um dangerous for long active managers a manager who owned gme based on fundamentals was simply lucky and furthermore a manager who bought gme at the peak of the mania would have been anchored and suffered huge losses for passive investing a passive investor who simply owned an smp 500 index fund like spy was almost completely insulated from this firm specific non-fundamental mania the gme event um is one of the strongest arguments for passive investing it highlights of catastrophic, unpredictable, and unmodelable firm-specific risk that active management exposes a portfolio to. Our analysis of the Robinhood salt show that the plumbing of the market is a tangible risk. The SEC's official report on the event confirms this. And the GME event forced regulators to evolve their thinking on several key issues as well of gamification of trading, short-selling transparency, payment for order flow, and settlement cycles t plus two um the evolving the asset substitution problem this is like a high level application of core finance it's like the asset substitution problem is a classic agency conflict in corporate finance it occurs in a leveraged firm a firm with debt it describes how equity holders who have limited downside have an incentive to substitute safe low risk assets projects with risk with risky high stakes assets projects why if the why if the risky project fails the debt holders bond holders are wiped out if the risky projects to seize the equity holders get all the upside it's a heads i win tails you lose bet that expropriate steals wealth from debt holders and inverted application to gme we can reframe the gme trade using this exact logic of the leverage from the equity holders to save assets and the risky asset uh now to reflect uh the primary question was whether gme event constitutes evidence against the market efficiency um our analysis shows that answer is nuanced the gme event does not kill the emh and modernizes it and our thesis is that the market is efficient but not always rational in the 1970s on fundamental based definition of the word the synthesis the price of gme did reflect all available information as the emh posits um the problem for old models is that the most important piece of available information was not the gme's balance sheet um um the most important information was the behavioral and systematic the public 140 short interest data and the public coordinated intent of a massive group of retail traders to exploit it and the final synthesis is that the market efficiency process the behavioral information the price of 483 um was in a strange way the efficient price given the public knowledge that i heard was acting on the 140 short interest the gme event therefore is not a feeler of the emh but a modern update to it where the publicly available information now clearly and demonstrably includes socially informed collective intent finally last but not least of the reflect part is that the gme event does not prove the emh is wrong it proves that the market is a complex adaptive system it showed that weak form emh was violated semi-strong form emh must be updated to include social media sentiment as a new powerful and rapidly incorporated form of public information and behavioral biases can when coordinated become the fundamental information that the market prices limits to arbitrage are not the just theories they are the most powerful forces in a market crisis um ultimately the gme provided no rational systematic profit opportunity for an investor it was speculative lottery driven by rational thesis term behavioral mania that was ultimately cut short not by return to fundamentals but by a mechanical failure of the market's own plumbing thank you",
