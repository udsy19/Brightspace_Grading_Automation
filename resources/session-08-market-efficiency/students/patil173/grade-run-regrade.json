  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, accurate conceptual understanding of all three EMH forms, links each form to specific empirical tests and examples (momentum, analyst estimates, short interest, Reddit coordination), and proposes a quantitative event-study method. Coverage is comprehensive and applied across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student identifies and documents concrete abnormal-return episodes, links them to market structure and behavioral causes, and outlines a quantitative event-study approach to measure AR/CAR. Coverage is specific, applied across DRIVER stages, and provides both empirical examples and theoretical explanations, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem and framed clear, testable objectives (EMH forms and behavioral explanations) during the Discover/Define stage. The subsequent Represent and Implement steps directly follow that definition, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes event-study methodology and AR/CAR concepts and computed raw daily returns showing extreme abnormalities, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not implement the formal event-study steps (estimation window, CAPM/market-model parameter estimation, AR/CAR calculation, or statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information-incorporation concepts (semi-strong EMH), identifies abnormal price/volume behavior, and proposes an appropriate event-study methodology. However, they did not implement the event-study (estimation window, model parameter estimation, AR/CAR calculation, or timing/statistical tests of how quickly information was reflected), so the treatment is conceptually sound but empirically incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed raw daily returns and described an event-study methodology but did not explicitly perform or show abnormal-return calculations (no estimation window, no market-model/CAPM parameter estimation, no AR/CAR numbers or statistical tests) nor provided block-by-block implementation details. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of attempted abnormal-return calculations and personal execution, the submission fails this criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jasvika — I’m really pleased with how you’ve embraced the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently followed the D‑R‑I‑V‑E‑R steps: your problem definition was crisp, your root causes were laid out logically, and the way you tied solution choices back to business criteria showed a genuine shift from “monkey mind” instincts to systematic analysis. I also want to call out two concrete strengths: you integrated technology into your finance reasoning (using data tools to check assumptions rather than as a substitute for judgement), and your explanations were clear and audience‑aware — you translated technical outputs into business implications cleanly.\n\nNext steps to build on that momentum. First, continue sharpening financial concept accuracy: you’ve made good progress aligning formulas and assumptions with theory, but push this further by routinely reconciling model outputs with financial intuition. Practical actions: after each model run, write a one‑paragraph sanity check (does the IRR, margin, or cash‑flow profile match what a treasurer or CFO would expect?) and compare against a benchmark or simple back‑of‑envelope calculation. Second, address the remaining technical implementation gap by formalizing your model audit process — document key assumptions, run sensitivity tables for the 3–5 most material inputs, and flag break‑points where recommendations would reverse. These steps are directly useful in real business contexts like capital budgeting, pricing strategy, and risk management.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a career habit, not a checklist. Systematic thinking will make your analyses faster to trust, easier to explain, and far more influential in business decisions. I’m excited to see how you iterate — your growth trajectory shows this is only the beginning."
