  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, outlines and implements concrete tests for each (momentum, public-info comparison, abnormal returns), and proposes further rigorous analysis (event study, borrow-cost/limits-to-arbitrage). Coverage is specific, applied to data, and synthesized across DRIVER stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the research problem and the hypotheses (EMH forms), documents a concrete research design (data sources, visual and statistical tests), and verifies data integrity prior to analysis. The Define & Discover stages are clearly and concretely demonstrated, meeting the strict requirement for explicit methodology and problem framing.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit, and actionable framework (data, benchmark, visualization, and targeted tests) for analyzing efficiency around the GME event. The plan is sufficiently specific to be executed and defended, meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of event-study methodology and abnormal-return measures and performed basic return analysis and visualization. However, they did not carry out the full formal event study (no CAPM estimation, AR/CAR calculations, statistical tests or presented results), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, earning PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses information-incorporation issues, cites concrete examples (analyst estimates, short interest, volume spikes) and computes returns showing abnormal moves. However, they did not perform the formal event-study timing/statistical tests (AR/CAR estimation, significance testing) to rigorously measure how quickly and accurately information was incorporated, so the treatment is conceptually sound but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies key behavioral biases (herding, overconfidence, FOMO) and connects them to empirical signals (momentum, volume). However, treatment is incomplete: several listed biases in the criterion (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed or exemplified, and the behavioral analysis lacks deeper examples or testing, so the coverage is correct but not thorough.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jasvika — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve been communicating complex finance ideas. Your written explanations of cash-flow drivers and the intuition behind discounting (you tie assumptions to business realities rather than abstract numbers) show real progress toward systematic thinking. In class discussion you consistently translate technical terms into decision-relevant language, which is exactly the skill finance teams need when presenting to non‑technical stakeholders.\n\nNow for next steps to sharpen impact. You’re close on financial concept accuracy — tighten a few definitional and calculation points by doing targeted reconciliations: pick two core metrics (for example NPV vs. IRR and WACC components) and create a one‑page “truth table” that maps formulas to business interpretations and common pitfalls. For technical implementation, focus on model validation rather than coding style: build simple sanity checks (sign checks, range checks, breakpoint tests) and a short checklist to run before sharing a model. This will make your outputs trusted in real business settings — think capital budgeting decisions, pricing models, or investor decks. For integrating finance and technology, practice translating model outputs into actionable KPIs and visual summaries: create a two‑slide decision brief from one of your models that shows the recommendation, the sensitivity of the recommendation to key assumptions, and the top three risks.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails that enforce your financial logic. Your systematic approach already sets you apart; deepen it with these practical routines and you’ll become the person leadership turns to when a clear, defensible financial decision is needed. This is a journey — you’re on a strong trajectory, and I’m excited to see where you take it next."
