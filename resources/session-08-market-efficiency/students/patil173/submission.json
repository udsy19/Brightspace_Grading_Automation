  "transcript": "Hello, this is my Session Eight assignment where I am going to do a GME market efficiency analysis, investigating the market efficiency using GameStop as my company. Our objective is to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, EMH, and assess behavioral finance explanations for this unprecedented event. My entire analysis is structured in sequence using the DRIVER framework: define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect. Let's get into the first step, define and discover. The Define stage establishes our core research question: was the GME squeeze a violation of market efficiency, and if so, which form? We focus on the three forms of EMH: weak, which considers past prices; semi-strong, which considers public information; and strong, which considers all information. The critical first step is data verification because the statement given may not be accurate. My first critical step was to verify the claim that GME traded at $0.04 in August 2020. This step has to be completed before any implementation. Using Yahoo Finance, I isolated all August 2020 prices. The lowest split-adjusted price is $1.04, not $0.04. The lowest split-adjusted closing price in August 2020 was $1.04. My documented communication approach for this situation is that the critical first step revealed a significant error: the lowest August 2020 price was $1.04, not $0.04. I will proceed with the accurate split-adjusted data for the analysis. This establishes the correct baseline for investigation. In the Represent step, I planned the analytical approach to connect the data to theory. First, data acquisition: I pulled data for GME and the S&P 500 benchmark using the yfinance library. Next, visualization: creating a two-panel chart, one for price and one for volume to illustrate retail activity. Then, analytical testing: visually testing the weak form by looking for momentum and the semi-strong form by checking the price against public analyst estimates of $10 to $40. Lastly, the behavioral framework integrates theories like herding, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage to explain any observed inefficiency. In the Implement stage, I executed the plan using the Python script. In Define and Represent, I explained what my analysis would be and how I would conduct it. In Implement, I pulled the script, ran the code, and obtained the two graphs and outputs. The code uses adjusted close prices to correctly account for the 2022 4-for-1 stock split. For data collection, I pulled GME and the S&P 500 from August 2020 to mid-2022. For verification, I ran the check. The script confirms the lowest August 2020 price was approximately $1.04. The incorrect prompt value is now documented. For visualization, the top chart shows price on a log scale, illustrating extreme volatility. The peak pre-split price of $483 illustrates the massive disconnect from the $10 to $40 fundamental value. The bottom chart shows volume. The volume spike in January 2021 increased tenfold, indicating a market structure event rather than a fundamental shift. For daily returns analysis, the script calculates daily returns. Multiple days had returns exceeding 100%, highly abnormal and not explained by normal market risk factors, a strong initial indicator of inefficiency. In the Validate step, I confirmed the reliability of results. Adjusted close data ensured statistical accuracy for historical comparison. Price decoupling from the S&P 500 benchmark and the volume spike confirms robustness. Daily returns analysis shows abnormal returns outside the bounds of normal risk-adjusted market movements, signaling a violation of the semi-strong form. In the Evolve step, I enhanced the analysis and addressed advanced requirements. A full event study could use CAPM to calculate alpha and beta during a normal estimation period, then compute abnormal returns (AR) and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) during the squeeze, quantifying the inefficiency. Limits to arbitrage can be tested by acquiring the cost to borrow GME shares. High borrow costs explain why hedge funds could not correct the price, allowing the inefficiency to persist. Systematic profit was not possible; profits depended on timing and luck, reinforcing passive management principles. In the Reflect stage, I synthesized findings. Weak form EMH was violated: the phenomenon was driven by momentum and herding behavior, which uses past price data to predict future gains. Semi-strong form was severely violated: all public information, including high short interest, analyst estimates of $10–$40, and Reddit coordination, was not reflected in the price. Strong form was violated: since public information was mispriced, the market was inefficient relative to all information. Behavioral finance explains the event: it was fueled by psychological biases like FOMO, herding, and the belief that retail investors could achieve guaranteed profit. The anomaly persisted not because the market was fundamentally irrational, but because limits to arbitrage and the risks and costs for rational investors, including hedge funds, to correct mispricing were too high. This illustrates that EMH is a model, and in real markets, structural flaws allow behavioral anomalies to temporarily dominate. In conclusion, the GME case was a short-term violation of the semi-strong EMH, driven by behavioral finance principles and allowed to persist due to market microstructure issues. That completes my Session Eight analysis. Thank you.",
