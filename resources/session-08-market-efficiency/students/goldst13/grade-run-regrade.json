  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the research objective and clearly defines the anomaly to be tested against EMH, including the planned testing of the three EMH forms. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission contains clear, explicit reflection on the findings and their implications beyond the assignment—assessing EMH, citing fragility of its forms, and recommending a behavioral-mechanic interpretation—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses all three EMH forms, cites data verification, and gives concrete examples (price vs. fundamental estimates and mechanics of the squeeze), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However the treatment is more descriptive than deeply analytical or comprehensive (limited quantitative testing or alternative counterarguments), so it meets a solid but not thorough standard—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student frames an investigation of market efficiency and verifies price data (Implement) but provides no event-study methodology (no estimation/event windows, market model, abnormal returns or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical tests). Their analysis is descriptive (volume, short interest) and reflective about EMH (Reflect), so the specific criterion—formal event-study and abnormal-return computation—is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how semi-strong efficiency relates to public information and argues the event showed short-term failures, supported by verified price data (Implement) and reflective interpretation. However, the treatment is conceptual and lacks direct analysis of information arrival versus price reaction (no timing, event-window, or statistical evidence), so the coverage is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Abby — I’ve been struck by how clearly you’ve shifted from scattered “what-if” thinking to a reproducible, DRIVER-style workflow. Your assignments consistently show a clear Define (you pick the right business question), a logical Rationale for assumptions, and repeatable Evidence-gathering steps — that systematic structure is exactly what separates ad-hoc analysis from reliable finance work. I also appreciate the way you explain model outcomes in plain language for stakeholders; your summaries translate numbers into decisions, which is a rare and valuable strength.\n\nFor next steps, target the specific gaps we’ve seen. First, tighten one remaining financial-concepts area by revisiting the economic intuition behind the metric (for example, if discounted cash flow assumptions caused confusion, run a short exercise: map how growth, margin, and discount-rate shifts change enterprise value). That exercise will directly improve capital-budgeting or valuation work in real business cases. Second, address the technical-implementation issue with a simple checklist: validate inputs, add one sensitivity table, and document any key formula assumptions. Those small guardrails will make your analyses defensible in board-level conversations. Finally, deepen the integration of finance and technology by using scenario templates: produce a best/base/worst set of outputs tied to business triggers (sales thresholds, churn rates). That bridges your models to actionable management decisions.\n\nKeep treating the DRIVER checklist as your north star — it’s already making you a systematic thinker who can be trusted with high-stakes financial questions. This is a career-long journey: each concrete improvement you make now (clear assumptions, scenario mapping, input validation) multiplies your impact later. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next — you’re building the habits that leaders rely on."
