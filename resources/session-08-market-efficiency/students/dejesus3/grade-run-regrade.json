  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines all three EMH forms and explicitly tests them using data and validation (returns vs. S&P, short interest, volume). They apply these concepts to conclude a likely semi-strong violation with supporting empirical evidence and reflection, showing a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market‑efficiency testing problem (research question and scope) and translated it into testable constructs (the three EMH forms). This explicit framing satisfies the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a systematic implementation: data acquisition, coding to compute returns, visual/chart outputs, and a market‑comparison validation—fulfilling the methodological workflow requirement. While some low‑level details (exact code blocks/statistical outputs) are not shown in the transcript, the submission demonstrates organized, repeatable execution and multiple outputs, meeting the PASS standard for IMPLEMENT.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied a comparative return approach and claimed abnormal returns using code and validation, showing conceptual understanding of event testing. However, key methodological details and calculations (estimation methodology, abnormal-return formulas, event/estimation windows, significance testing and numeric results) are missing, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses how information (and sentiment) affected prices and uses return comparisons to show abnormal behavior, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide rigorous timing measures (event/estimation windows, intraday analysis, or explicit statistical timing of incorporation), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculation (personal data retrieval and a returns comparison) and reported results, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT requirements they did not provide explicit code blocks, block‑by‑block explanations, AR/CAR formulas, estimation/event windows, or statistical output—so the implementation is incomplete for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Arturo — I’ve been impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a clear, repeatable process. You consistently break problems into DRIVER’s discrete steps, state your assumptions up front, and set logical guardrails so conclusions follow from data rather than intuition. Your habit of scripting reproducible steps and using AI as an execution aide shows real maturity: those are the habits that turn a “monkey mind” into systematic thinking. I also noticed you lean on scenario structuring well — that clarity will pay off in any finance role.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact: deepen a couple of financial-concept edges you’re already working on. For example, when you model a project’s value, explicitly map operating cash flows, working capital effects, and terminal value drivers before discounting; run sensitivity checks on WACC and growth assumptions to see which inputs move NPV most. In practical business terms, practice this by taking a capital-budgeting case (purchase vs. lease, or product launch) and producing a short memo that links model outputs to decision thresholds for stakeholders.\n\nOn the technical-integration side, focus on model robustness and traceability: add simple sanity checks (signs, range limits), label calculation blocks so an analyst can audit quickly, and automate scenario runs so executive trade-offs are easy to present. Practically, try turning one of your models into a dashboard or a one-page decision table you could show a CFO.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory where systematic thinking becomes a strategic advantage — not a destination but a practice. Keep treating assumptions as the north star, connect models to business decisions, and the cognitive tools you’re building will compound into leadership-level judgment. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
