  "transcript": "Hi everyone, In this project, I'm analyzing the GameStop (GME) short squeeze from 2020 to 2021 to see how it relates to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH. Some sources claimed that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020. That's incorrect — according to Yahoo Finance, the real price was around $4 per share, not four cents. Here's a quick timeline of the event: * August 2020: Stock around $4, company struggling. * September 2020: Ryan Cohen (founder of Chewy) buys a 13% stake. * January 2021: Reddit's r/wallstreetbets community drives a price surge up to $483. * February 2021: Congressional hearings begin after trading apps like Robinhood restricted trades. * Afterward: Price eventually stabilized between $10 and $30. So my main question is: Did the GameStop short squeeze disprove market efficiency, or can it still fit within the EMH framework? ________________ 💡 2. REPRESENT Now, let's represent the problem using the three forms of market efficiency: * Weak Form: Prices reflect all past data (like trends or past prices). * Semi-Strong Form: Prices reflect all public information. * Strong Form: Prices reflect all information, even private or insider data. I'm testing which form might have been violated during the GameStop event. I'll also include behavioral finance factors — such as herding, FOMO, and overconfidence — since social media played a big role in this event. ________________ 🧮 3. IMPLEMENT Now let's look at the data. I used Python and Yahoo Finance to download and analyze GameStop's stock prices. When I ran this, the chart clearly showed the massive price spike in January 2021, where prices shot up over 1,000% in just a few days. Trading volume also jumped about 10 times higher than usual, and short interest reached over 140% of the available shares — meaning more shares were shorted than actually existed. That kind of activity is not normal in an efficient market. ________________ 📊 4. VALIDATE To validate the results, I compared GME's returns with the overall market (S&P 500). Here's a short piece of Python code that can compare GameStop's daily returns to the S&P 500's returns: The validation shows that GameStop's abnormal returns were massive and statistically unusual — not explained by new public information. That means the semi-strong form of EMH was likely violated because prices didn't adjust rationally or instantly to news. ________________ 🚀 5. EVOLVE From this event, we can see that the market was not efficient in the short term. Prices were driven more by emotion and group behavior than fundamentals. Many traders bought in due to social media hype, while hedge funds suffered big losses. However, over time, prices returned closer to reality, showing that the market eventually corrected itself. For most investors, trying to \"beat the system\" during the squeeze didn't work — most late buyers lost money when the price crashed. So, while EMH struggled in the short term, it held up in the long term. ________________ 💭 6. REFLECT To wrap up, this case showed both sides of market theory. It proved that: * The market can be irrational in the short term. * But over time, it tends to return to efficiency. Behavioral finance gives us tools to understand why — herding, overconfidence, and fear of missing out made the GameStop bubble grow fast, but also pop fast. The takeaway: EMH still matters, but investor psychology can temporarily break it. For most people, passive investing remains safer than chasing social media hype. ________________ 📘 Summary Slide (End of Video) Topic Key Point Verified Price $4 in Aug 2020, not $0.04 Form Violated Semi-strong EMH Profit Chance Only early traders gained; not repeatable Biases Seen Herding, FOMO, overconfidence Market Result Short-term inefficiency, long-term correction Main Lesson Markets react to emotions before correcting ________________ The GameStop short squeeze reminds us that markets aren't always perfect — but over time, they still tend to get it right. Thanks for watching!\"",
