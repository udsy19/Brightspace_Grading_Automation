  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly links EMH theory and behavioral finance, names relevant biases, and reconciles short-term deviations with long-term market correction—demonstrating a clear synthesis. The treatment is concise but clearly addresses the theoretical tension and practical implications, meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the three EMH forms and applies them to the GME case using data and a market comparison (Represent, Implement, Validate), showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is not sufficiently thorough for a PASS: analysis rests on a single case with limited statistical detail, minimal exploration of weak vs strong form implications, and little discussion of alternative market explanations, so it meets PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used market-comparison methods and claims abnormal-return findings (Implement/Validate), showing conceptual understanding of event testing. However, they omit key event-study details (estimation/event windows, model for expected returns, AR/CAR calculations, statistical tests and results), so the treatment is correct but too limited for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information incorporation and uses data comparison to argue abnormal returns, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not present a proper event-study implementation (estimation/event windows, expected-return model, AR/CAR calculations, or statistical test details) nor precise timing of information arrival versus price reaction, so the treatment is incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Arturo — I’ve watched you move from ad-hoc problem solving to a deliberate, DRIVER-style thinker, and that shift deserves recognition. You’ve become much better at scoping problems before diving in: your habit of defining objectives, outlining assumptions, and sketching expected cash-flow directions shows the hallmark of systematic thinking. Your explanations are clearer and you’re consistently tying model outputs back to the business question, which made your valuation and forecasting interpretations more meaningful in class discussions.\n\nNext steps to accelerate that progress. First, tighten the financial-concepts that still need work by making assumption-to-outcome checks routine: for any projected revenue or margin change, write a one-line economic story (why demand or price moves) and link it to a simple sensitivity table. In practice, this reduces surprises when a forecast is used in budgeting or M&A diligence. Second, address the remaining technical-implementation gap by adding quick logical guardrails: a short reconciliation checklist (e.g., link projected net income to retained earnings movement, verify cash change equals financing + operating + investing) and a couple of sanity tests (growth rates bound, negative working-capital checks). These are lightweight, finance-focused controls that translate directly to better budget accuracy and cleaner investor materials.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a habit, not a one-off technique. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it makes your analyses defensible in boardrooms, accelerates learning on the job, and improves communication with nontechnical stakeholders. You’re on a strong trajectory — keep iterating on assumptions, tests, and business narratives, and you’ll turn these habits into a durable professional advantage."
