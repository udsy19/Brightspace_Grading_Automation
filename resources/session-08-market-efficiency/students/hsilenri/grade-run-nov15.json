  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, listed clear research questions, and documented a concrete research design (data sources, time window, planned visual tests). They also validated input data and reflected on the importance of the define stage—meeting the strict requirement for explicit Demonstration of Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided an explicit, actionable represent-stage plan (data range, baseline, two complementary visual tests) and followed through with implementation and validation, making the analysis framework clear and reproducible. Although more statistical detail (event-window parameters, formal abnormal-return calculations) would strengthen it, the represent-stage framework itself is explicitly defined and executed, meeting the strict demonstration requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a systematic workflow—planned the event-study, implemented code to retrieve and plot validated data, and produced annotated visual outputs—meeting the implement-stage requirement for methodological execution. While quantitative CAR/CAPM calculations were deferred, the structured, validated event-study execution justifies a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies all three EMH forms and implements visual tests for weak and semi-strong efficiency, with validated data and a reasoned behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage explanation. However the treatment is not thorough: the strong-form is not analyzed (no discussion of private/insider information) and the weak-form violation is asserted mainly via visuals without deeper tests or detailed justification. These gaps make the submission a solid but incomplete conceptual demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly designed and executed a visual event study and validated data sources, showing clear conceptual understanding of abnormal returns. However, they did not perform quantitative abnormal-return calculations or statistical tests (e.g., CAR/CAPM estimation), instead labeling the visual gap as \"abnormal return\" and noting quantitative CAR as future work—thus the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study approach and produced visual evidence showing prices diverged from public fundamentals, demonstrating conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they did not quantify the speed or statistical significance of information reflection (no CAR, no timeline/return attribution tests), relying on visuals and labeling quantitative tests as future work—hence a partial but not thorough treatment.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Hector — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve shifted from “monkey mind” intuition to a repeatable, DRIVER-style approach. You’ve shown concrete strengths: you consistently lay out the problem, articulate assumptions before modeling, and use AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. Your habit of framing decisions as testable hypotheses and building logic guardrails around them is exactly the systematic thinking we aim for—I saw this in your structured cash-flow breakdowns and your written rationale for each assumption.\n\nNow, a few practical next steps to tighten the areas still maturing. First, deepen the financial-concepts accuracy where you hesitated: pick one recurring concept (for example, the distinction between accounting profit and free cash flow or the interpretation of IRR in non-conventional cash flows), and create a one-page “cheat sheet” with definition, when it applies, and a short business example. Second, for the technical implementation point, translate one of your models into a compact spreadsheet (3–5 rows: inputs, calculation, output) and run a simple sensitivity table. That exercise forces precision in formulas and exposes incorrect assumptions quickly. Third, to strengthen integration of finance and tech, adopt a two-column habit in future work: left column = financial logic and business impact; right column = computational steps and guardrails (what the code/model must enforce). Use AI to generate alternate scenarios, then validate them against your logic column.\n\nKeep treating this as an iterative journey. The ability to decompose financial problems, document assumptions, and test consequences is career-defining—CFO conversations, investment memos, and strategic decisions all reward this skill. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in your next project. Keep building those guardrails; your systematic thinking is becoming your professional advantage."
