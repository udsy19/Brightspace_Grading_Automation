  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, frames testable questions, and specifies scope and measurable methods (data window, model, metrics). This satisfies the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, stepwise plan: specified data, exact time window, the modeling approach (CAPM), the abnormal/CAR calculations, and intended outputs (plots, event markers). This explicit layout satisfies the strict Represent requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow from planning (data and metrics) to execution (AI-assisted code, running and fixing in Colab) and produced organized outputs (returns, regression results, plots). This demonstrates methodological implementation across stages and multiple outputs, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak/semi-strong/strong forms and applies an event-study/CAPM approach to evaluate EMH, citing abnormal returns and concluding a semi-strong violation—showing conceptual understanding and applied methodology. However, the treatment lacks thoroughness (limited statistical testing details, minimal discussion of strong-form evidence and robustness), so the response is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and applies an event-study approach (CAPM market model, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and ran regressions with concrete output, showing applied methodology. However, the treatment omits key methodological/detail elements (estimation window for parameters, statistical significance testing for abnormal/CARs, robustness checks and adjustments), so the work is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information incorporation under EMH and applies an event-study methodology to detect abnormal returns around news events, showing applied understanding. However, the treatment omits critical depth on the speed/ timing of incorporation (event window selection, intraday vs daily measures), significance testing of abnormal returns, and robustness checks, so the work is conceptually correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Deep — I’m really struck by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset: your solutions consistently show clear decomposition of problems, disciplined logic guardrails, and thoughtful use of AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. In your last assignment you broke a complex cash‑flow forecasting task into crisp subproblems, documented assumptions explicitly, and produced a repeatable pipeline — that kind of systematic thinking is exactly what turns reactive “monkey mind” work into reliable finance decision support.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening a few practical lenses that will make your models sing in real business settings. First, deepen the financial-concept checks: after a model run, reconcile key outputs (EBITDA, NWC, free cash flow) back to basic accounting identities and explain any divergence in plain language. Second, strengthen model validation: add simple stress tests and sensitivity tables that show how a 10–20% change in top-line growth or margins affects valuation and liquidity. Third, make integration explicit: map your model outputs to business KPIs (burn rate, runway, ROI) so stakeholders see direct implications for strategy and capital decisions. Finally, polish communication for executives: lead with a 2–3 sentence recommendation, then show the supporting numbers and a one‑chart scenario comparison.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory few reach early in their careers. Systematic, documented thinking will let you advise executives with confidence and scale your work to larger, messier problems. Keep iterating the DRIVER habits — treat each model as a small experiment — and you’ll build the kind of financial judgement that leaders depend on. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
