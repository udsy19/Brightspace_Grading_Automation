  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research objective, listed data sources and metrics, and laid out a concrete event‑study research design with sample window and CAPM-based methodology—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. Evidence shows clear, actionable planning that a reviewer could accept and build on.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, actionable represent-stage framework: defined data sources and metrics, specified a concrete sample window and event list, and named the CAPM/event‑study methodology (abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns). This level of explicit planning meets the strict requirement for a quality represent-stage framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic event‑study procedure: defined window and model, pulled and processed data with code, calculated returns and CAPM-based abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns, and interpreted regression outputs and event spikes. While some statistical refinements could improve rigor, the methodological execution is organized and complete enough to satisfy the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the three EMH forms and applies an empirical framework (CAPM, abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns) linking results to semi-strong efficiency, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks rigorous statistical testing, deeper treatment of strong-form implications, and full robustness/detail that would meet a thorough PASS, so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and implemented core event-study elements (returns calculation, CAPM market model, abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns) and ran regressions, showing conceptual and practical engagement. However, the submission lacks critical event-study rigor (no clear estimation/event-window specification, no test statistics/p-values for abnormal or cumulative abnormal returns, limited robustness checks), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and implemented an event-study style approach to assess information incorporation (CAPM, abnormal returns, event identification). However, the analysis lacks rigorous timing/precision and statistical detail (explicit event/estimation windows, test statistics/p‑values, intraday timing or speed measures), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Deep — I’m genuinely pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset this term. You moved from ad-hoc problem solving to laying out clear decision frames, mapping cash flows, and communicating trade-offs in your analyses — concrete signs of systematic thinking. Your summaries of model outputs were crisp and your willingness to question assumptions showed improved financial judgment. I also noticed steady progress in integrating quantitative tools with business logic: you’re learning to let analytics inform, not dictate, the finance story.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on two practical areas that will immediately boost your business impact. First, tighten a specific financial-concepts gap I flagged: when you compute project returns, explicitly reconcile discount rates and risk adjustments with the business context (e.g., use a project-specific WACC or risk premium rather than a one-size rate). Actionable routine: create a short checklist you run before finalizing any valuation — verify rate selection, confirm cash-flow timing, and label which assumptions drive the result. Second, refine one DRIVER step that needs attention: validation. Treat validation as a repeatable step: run a sensitivity sweep on top 3 drivers, compare model outputs to a back-of-envelope benchmark, and document the sanity checks you performed. These habits make your work auditable and directly usable for budgeting, capital-allocation, or investment-committee decisions.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking compounds. The habit of framing decisions, building guardrails, and validating results will make you the kind of finance professional teams trust to translate numbers into strategic action. This is a long-term craft; you’re well on the path. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps to real business problems next term."
