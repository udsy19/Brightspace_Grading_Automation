  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them to the GameStop case using an event-study, statistical results, and economic interpretation. They explicitly consider behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage and conclude semi-strong EMH as a baseline with explained exceptions, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly designed and executed an event study (specified event date and ±10-day window), chose a market benchmark (S&P 500) as the expected-return model, calculated abnormal returns and t-statistics, and discussed statistical and economic interpretation and limitations. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology and abnormal-return calculation consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly linked speed/accuracy of information incorporation to semi-strong EMH, designed and executed an event study (±10 days vs S&P500), reported abnormal-return statistics, and discussed economic interpretation and frictions that explain deviations. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several biases (herding, overconfidence, anchoring) to explain the GME episode, showing conceptual understanding and linkage to results. However treatment is brief and omits explicit discussion of loss aversion and mental accounting and lacks deeper examples or analysis, so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and tested for market anomalies via an event study and reported abnormal-return statistics, demonstrating conceptual and applied understanding. However, they did not explicitly analyze standard anomaly categories (momentum, value, size, calendar) or provide multiple comparative examples, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed abnormal returns relative to the S&P500 but explicitly avoided a regression/CAPM approach and never demonstrated CAPM-specific calculations (beta, risk-free rate, CAPM expected return) or clear personal, block-level understanding of the code (relied on AI). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit CAPM implementation and ownership, the submission fails.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tirth — I’ve really noticed how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a disciplined, repeatable way of thinking. You consistently applied the DRIVER lens to break problems into Data, Rules, Insights, Value, Execution, and Rigor: your write-ups clearly isolated key assumptions, translated them into decision-relevant metrics, and explained the business logic behind each step. Your explanations were especially strong — you make complex trade-offs easy for a stakeholder to understand, which is exactly the kind of systematic thinking finance teams need.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on strengthening the technical implementation piece so your thoughtful frameworks reliably produce usable outputs in real business settings. Practical next steps:\n- Convert a recent case into a compact, reproducible model (one input sheet of assumptions, a clear calculation sheet, and an output/dashboard). This makes it easier for managers to re-run scenarios.\n- Add a short “assumption checklist” and sensitivity table that ties each assumption to a commercial impact (e.g., 1% change in occupancy → X% change in NPV). That links your logic directly to decisions.\n- Build a brief reconciliation section: how model outputs map to business KPIs (cash flow, payback, IRR) and where judgment calls matter. Share this with a peer for a quick sanity check.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory where systematic thinking will become your career differentiator. Treat this as continuous craftwork: each model, memo, and assumption check sharpens your judgment. Keep leaning into the DRIVER habit — your ability to translate ambiguity into clear, decision-ready insight will open doors in investment analysis, corporate finance, or strategy. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
