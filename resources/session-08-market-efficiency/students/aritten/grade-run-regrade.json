  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and applies weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH to the GameStop episode, cites specific empirical facts (price peak vs. fundamental estimates, short interest, trading restrictions), and reflects on limits to arbitrage and behavioral drivers. Coverage is conceptually thorough with multiple supporting examples and logical application, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem—case selection, verification step, and the EMH hypotheses to test—meeting the explicitness required by this criterion. Statements show a concrete, testable framing (data verification and form-specific hypotheses), so the Define & Discover stage is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, repeatable workflow: case selection, data verification, data retrieval, coding to compute abnormal returns/daily returns/volatility, and interpretation against EMH—demonstrating systematic implementation. Multiple analysis outputs and verification steps are referenced, meeting the moderate DRIVER-Implement standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and computes abnormal/daily returns and uses empirical data (Implement), and frames the analysis around an event study (Discover). However, the submission lacks a thorough event-study methodology—no description of benchmark model, estimation/event windows, cumulative abnormal return calculation, or significance testing—so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information-incorporation questions, uses event data, and argues that public fundamentals were not promptly reflected (showing conceptual understanding). However, they do not present quantitative timing/accuracy metrics (e.g., event/estimation windows, reaction-time analysis, or statistical significance tests), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission mentions code and abnormal-return metrics but provides no explicit evidence of personal execution, block-level explanation, verification steps, or ownership required by this STRICT technical criterion. Because the student did not demonstrate running the code, explain functions, or present computed results with validation, the criterion is not met.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Aiden — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from fragmented approaches to a clearer, stepwise problem-solving style. You consistently broke down valuation and risk questions into DRIVER-like steps (Define the problem, Identify inputs, Run scenarios), and your explanations showed disciplined attention to cash-flow timing and the logic behind discount choices. That systematic framing — separating assumptions, mechanics, and interpretation — is exactly the shift we aim for: you’re thinking like someone who can explain a number to a CFO, not just produce one.\n\nNext steps to keep that momentum: tighten a couple of technical habits so your financial judgments are even more defensible. When you construct a model or a scenario, explicitly list the critical assumptions that would change the decision (growth rates, terminal multiple, working capital dynamics) and run focused sensitivity checks on those levers. Translate those checks into business questions — e.g., “If sales growth falls 200 bps, can the business maintain operating leverage?” — so your outputs map to managerial actions. Also, validate new model outputs against simple hand-calculations or a one-sheet sanity check before presenting them; this prevents avoidable mismatches in meetings and builds stakeholder confidence.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as your scaffold. Systematic thinking will make you a stronger analyst and communicator in FP&A, corporate strategy, or investment roles because it turns intuition into reproducible, explainable recommendations. This is a journey — keep iterating on assumptions, tests, and business translations. I’m excited to see where you take this structured approach next."
