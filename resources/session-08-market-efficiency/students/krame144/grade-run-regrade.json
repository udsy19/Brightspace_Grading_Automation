  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, applied treatment of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH: definitions, test criteria (abnormal returns), and concrete, multi-faceted application to the GameStop case with behavioral and microstructure mechanisms explaining violations. Driver stages (Discover → Implement → Validate/Reflect) are evident and support a comprehensive, expert-level discussion meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives a comprehensive, conceptually rigorous treatment of how markets incorporated new information: clearly distinguishing public vs. private/microstructure signals, citing concrete events (Ryan Cohen stake, analyst targets, Reddit coordination), and documenting persistence of mispricing. Although numerical event-study outputs are absent, the depth, multiple examples, and DRIVER-stage application satisfy the moderate standard for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defines abnormal returns and the estimation approach (market model), states the statistical criterion for EMH rejection, and applies the concept to multiple concrete aspects of the GME episode (momentum, sentiment signals, arbitrage limits). While numerical AR/CAR computations are absent, the treatment is thorough conceptually with multiple applications, meeting the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains event-study concepts (abnormal return, normal return, market model) and applies them conceptually to GME, showing understanding. However, treatment is high-level and lacks the concrete event-study implementation (estimation window, event window, AR/CAR formulas and numerical results or statistical tests), so it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explains the concept of abnormal returns and frames an event-study approach but provides no explicit calculations, numerical AR/CAR results, event/estimation window choices, statistical testing, or evidence of running code. Under the STRICT technical implementation standard requiring explicit execution and outputs, this omission fails the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly discusses verifying data and cites external evidence types (historical stock data, research findings, congressional testimony), showing they performed validation. However, they do not name the specific data providers, databases, or tools used to check prices/code outputs, so validation is present but not documented to the level required for PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Luisa — I want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from reactive problem-solving to a true DRIVER mindset. You consistently tied financial logic to technology: your discounted cash flow assumptions were clearly mapped to the data inputs you proposed automating, and your scenario taxonomy showed you understand how to structure stress tests before you build them. Your written explanations made model assumptions and causal links easy to follow — that clarity is exactly the systematic thinking we aim for.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on turning that strong logic into reproducible, auditable implementations. Practical actions you can take:\n- Build a minimal end-to-end prototype for one business question (e.g., a 3‑scenario cash flow projection) that demonstrates inputs → mechanics → outputs, with clear mapping of assumptions to results.  \n- Break the model into small, named components (data ingestion, core calculus, scenario module, output summary) and document the inputs/outputs for each. This makes validation and business use easier.  \n- Add simple validation checks and a few sensitivity runs so stakeholders can see how key drivers move valuation or cash flow — this is what finance teams actually act on.\n\nThese steps are about making your financial reasoning executable and trustworthy for business decisions, not about writing perfect code. As you iterate, you’ll find employers value someone who can define clean interfaces and reproducible experiments as much as anyone who types fast.\n\nKeep treating modeling as a disciplined practice. Your ability to structure problems and communicate assumptions will take you far in FP&A, corporate development, or any role that needs reliable financial judgment. I’m excited to see your next prototype — you’re building a foundation that scales with your career."
