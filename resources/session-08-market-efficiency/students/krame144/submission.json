This is going to be a long one, but we are now into session 8, and I appreciate how we're not just doing the same thing every single week. Like, now we have a case study in this course, and I find that very interesting. So, we're going to go ahead and get started. We are investigating the market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020-21 as a case study. We need to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to the efficient market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency if we explain within existing frameworks. The critical first step is to verify the statement, GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020, against actual historical data. And so we'll just jump right into it. That answer is no, according to historical stock data. This first chart is just a breakdown of the actual accurate figures in the correct time zone, or time frame. So you can see August 2020, which is what we were told to investigate, the price range is actually $1.04 to even $1.67, so much, much higher. And then just also for some background information, it was fairly low on August 3rd and August 7th, kind of like in the beginning of the month at $1.04, and then it was highest at the very end of the month at $1.67. So here I have a lot of information. The dramatic GameStop short squeeze event unfolded primarily in January of 2021. It represents a profound challenge to the fundamental tenets of modern financial economics, particularly that efficient market hypothesis, which we're going to get into. This report investigates the price behavior of the GameStop during this period, comparing it against the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or just EMH. I mean, GameStop will just be GME, or I'll just keep GameStop. It compares against the EMH predictions and assesses the role of both market microstructure and behavioral finance in generating extreme market anomalies. The analysis confirms that the GME short squeeze violated multiple forms of market efficiency. The rapid non-random price escalation contradicts the assumption of a weak form EMH. Furthermore, the sustaining massive divergence between the market price, which peaks near $483 per share, and the underlying fundamental valuation estimated to be well below $20 by institutional analysts, which constituted a clear rejection of the semi-strong form EMH. So, huge jump there. Crucially, the episode demonstrated the catastrophic failure of traditional market mechanisms, specifically arbitrage, to correct mispricing. Rationally, fundamentally focused short sellers suffered non-systematic losses exceeding $6 billion globally, with major funds like Melvin Capital losing 53% of their capital in just January 2021 alone. This inability to restore equilibrium was due to severe market frictions collectively defined by the Theory of Limits to Arbitrage, including noise-sharer risks and structural constraints, leading to extreme short interest, which reached up to 140% of the total. Ultimately, the GameStop phenomenon is best understood through a synthesized framework incorporating behavioral finance, which is explaining the initiation and persistence of the price bubble through mechanisms like herding and coordinated speculation. And along with behavioral finance, market microstructure analysis, which is explaining the dramatic climax in sudden intervention caused by outdated clearing and settlement bottlenecks. This event stands as a compelling case study of market fragility when speculative coordination meets acute structural vulnerability. The next section of this case study is the Factual Verification and Event Chronology, or our represent stage in the driver framework, still applying that to this case study. I first want to get into the correction of historical price data in the QEKP strategy. A critical prerequisite for really any rigorous financial analysis is the accurate verification of historical market data. We have talked about this a little bit before and how that statement is incorrect, but I do want to go into how relying on verified market data from the period, the price of GME stock in mid-2020 prior to the major catalyst was very, very high, with research indicating closing prices in the vicinity of $7.47 per share, which if you remember, in August 2020, it was $1.04 to $1.67. And now we can get into the pre-squeeze fundamentals and market sentiment. Before the short squeeze was commenced in early 2021, GameStop was widely viewed by institutional investors as a failing entity. The company's core business model, which is a brick-and-mortar video game retail source, was rapidly deteriorating due to the broader shift towards digital distribution of games. There's PS4s and YouTube. What's the need for GameStop anymore? The financial results reflected this negative outlook. The company reported very poor financial performance throughout 2020, including negative earnings during the second and the third quarters. Key fundamental valuation metrics were alarming. For the calendar year 2020, GME exhibited a profoundly negative earnings yield of negative 22.8%. Reflecting this pervasive pessimism, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly rated the stock as sell, with price targets set consistently low, such as $13.50 or even $10, confirming the institutional belief that the stock was fundamentally overvalued even at mid-single-digit prices. This collective analysis set the stage for aggressive short positioning. The catalyst and squeeze timeline, to talk about that timeline a little bit, the market dynamics began to shift in late 2020, initiating the events that culminated in the short squeeze. Some initial signs and extreme shortings, a significant initial sign, occurred in September 2020, when activist investor Ryan Cohen, through RC Ventures, gained an equity stake and secured a board seat. Cohen's involvement, leveraging his background in online retailing, introduced a potential narrative of corporate turnaround. This news was publicly available information, testing the semi-strong EMH. However, institutional short sellers, focusing on immediate negative fundamentals, largely disregarded this signal. Viewing the subsequent stock price increase as an unwarranted overvaluation that presented an ideal opportunity for shorting. This dynamic revealed a critical phenomenon. The initial activist investment served not as a rational price stabilizer of equal value, but as a credible narrative anchor for the advance that retail investors would face. This provided a pretext for fundamentally speculative buying, transforming what was intended as a signal value into a volatility play. The institutional shorts continued their aggressive positioning, leading to a profound structural vulnerability. By January 22, 2021, GameStop had become the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S. market, with short interest reaching a paradoxical and unprecedented peak of approximately 140% of the free float. This condition, where the number of shorted shares exceeds the shares available for trading due to relending practices, exposed a critical structural weakness. The existence of a short interest rate yield exceeding 100% meant the supply of shares required to cover existing short positions was theoretically impossible to meet, creating infinite short squeeze potential. This was not merely high risk. It was systematic market friction that fundamentally violated the efficient market assumption of continuous liquidity and unlimited arbitrage capital. The resulting price explosion was a function of forced liquidation rather than a consensus on valuation. Now we're going to get into the climax in intervention. The active squeeze commenced around January 13, 2021, driven by coordinated purchasing efforts orchestrated by retail investors using social media platforms, particularly the Reddit-slash-WallStreetBets forum. This collective action initiated a momentum feedback loop. Retail buying drove the price up, which triggered margin calls per short sellers, forcing them to buy back shares, which further accelerated the price spike. The climax occurred on January 28, 2021, with GameStop reaching a high of approximately $483. This volatility resulted in massive losses for hedge funds, Melvin Capital, for instance, again, he lost 43% of its investments that month alone and required a bailout from Citadel in 0.72. The squeeze was abruptly halted when several brokerages, most notably Robinhood, restricted the buying of GameStop and a few other volatile stocks while still permitting the selling of existing positions. This asymmetrical intervention immediately triggered a sharp retreat from the peak price. This table below summarizes the critical data points during this period. I apologize, I just realized that my recording paused and now I do not remember where to pick back up on, so I'm going to quickly go over the very ending of that climax and intervention and talk about that chart again. I really hope that we did already go over this and I'd rather cover something again rather than completely skip it. So this is just a table that summarizes the critical data points during the period of August 2020 to January 2021, which was that GameStop peak price and short interest data. And then now we're going into the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Theoretical Framework and Testable Implications, or AKA, implement in our driver framework. To review the EMH form and assumptions, I know we talked about it a little bit, like we defined it, we talked a little bit about its distinct forms, but I want to talk about the history a little bit. It is primarily attributed to economist Eugene Fama, who says that security prices reflect all available information, implying that assets trade at their fair value and that it is practically impossible to consistently outperform the market. The theory rests on the assumption of rational investors and free instantaneous flow of information. And so, again, as you can see on my document, I have the three distinct forms based on the scope of information incorporated into the price. I'm not going to go too into detail with that for the sake of time and the fact that we talked about them a little bit. But the three forms are the weak form EMH, the semi-strong form and the strong form. All right, so now we're going to get to the criteria for a violation of EMH. Testing the EMH involves defining and calculating abnormal return, or AR. An abnormal return is the difference between the security's actual return over a specified period and its expected normal return if the conditioning event had not occurred. The normal return is typically estimated using market-based models, such as the market model, which assumes a stable linear relationship between the security return and the overall market return. If a defined strategy, such as technical analysis, which we'll get into a little bit, fundamental analysis, or trading based on private information, systematically generates positive abnormal returns greater than the cost of capital and transaction costs over a long period, the relevant form of the EMH is rejected. So there's that criteria. And now we're going to get into the quantitative assessment of EMH violations in the GameStop event. So kind of applying that to our actual case study. We're going to first test for weak form efficiency, which goes into the technical analysis. The weak form EMH suggests that price movements should follow a random walk, meaning that past price patterns are irrelevant for predicting future returns. The GME short squeeze provides the GameStop stock price experienced an extreme rapid and sustained ascent, surging from approximately $20 per share on January 13, 2020, to its peak near $483. This movement was clearly momentum driven, fueled by collective action rather than a random series of independent trades. Research analyzing the event found that the returns of GME were closely coordinated with the positive sentiment and tone of the discussions occurring on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. This correlation implies that investors who are monitoring the social media sentiment, a non-traditional but exploitable informational signal, could have systematically capitalized on the coordinated buying pressure for a defined event window. The price movement was therefore non-random and predictable based on these external coordination signals. Additionally, during the high validity phase, January to February 2021, GME returns exhibited as unusual, sharply negative correlated with the broader market. This suggests that GME's movement was highly idiosyncratic and driven by specific internal pressures, the squeeze, rather than general market factors, further supporting the idea that its price pack was technically exploitable. The persistence of this explosive momentum resulting in massive profits for early buyers strongly suggests that the weak form EMH was violated. Now we're going to test for semi-strong form efficiency, the fundamental analysis. The semi-strong EMH demands that public information such as a company's financial health, the business model's decline, and the consistency of analyst price targets is immediately and accurately reflected in the stock price. So observe behavior and violation. The GameStop event presents a stark failure of the semi-strong form. At the height of the squeeze, the stock traded near $400 million per share, representing a valuation that bore no relationship to the publicly known fundamental health of the business. Publicly available financial data showed deteriorating revenues and losses. Institutional and analysts maintained sell ratings with price targets of $10 to $13.50. The massive discrepancy between the consensus, fundamental value, and the market price persisted for weeks. Even after the initial collapse of the peak, the price remained substantially elevated compared to the pre-squeeze level as late as mid-May 2021. The market price explicitly rejected decades of accumulated public financial information, demonstrating that the price was determined almost entirely by technical supply and demand mechanics, the squeeze, and behavioral coordination, rather than by public fundamental information. The sheer magnitude and duration of this mispricing, which traditional arbitrators could not correct, constitutes a conclusive violation. The semi-strong form EMH was clearly violated. Lastly, we're going to test for that strong form efficiency, which is that insider or private information. So, it is considered the most stringent and least likely to hold in reality, but the GME event introduced a new dimension related to microstructure information. The squeeze was halted not by a fundamental news release, but by an operational decision of brokerages like Robinhood to restrict borrowing. The decision was predicted on the urgent need to meet billions of dollars in collateral requirements imposed by the clearinghouse, DTCC, due to high volatility and settlement risk. While Robinhood publicly cited only market volatility in its initial communication, considering the critical financial necessity, the clearinghouse crisis itself constituted highly sensitive non-public operational information. Market participants who were intimately connected to the liquidity or capital flows within the clearing system, or who were monitoring the rapidly escalating margin requirements in real time, would have possessed a severe informational advantage regarding the imminence of the trading restrictions. Given that firms like Citadel, a major market maker for Robinhood, injected capital into the heavily shorted Melvin Capital and were privy to massive amounts of order flow data, the possibility exists that information regarding the impending systematic liquidity crunch, which triggered the trading halt, could have been exploited. If sophisticated participants traded based on proprietary intelligence regarding margin stress and impending regulatory or operational intervention prior to the public announcement of restrictions on January 28, 2021, they would have achieved a systematic advantage based on non-public microstructure friction intelligence. So this scenario suggests that the strong foreign image was plausibly violated. Next we're going to move on to the rationality and systematic profitability, or our validate stage of the German framework. We're getting into the arbitrage challenge. The core assumption of the EMH is that rational investors, upon observing a mispricing, will instantly act to capitalize on the inefficiency. In the GME case, the rational trade dictated short selling to profit from the anticipated correction back towards fundamental value. The hedge funds engaging in massive short positions were initially acting as rational arbiters. Now we're going to go on to the theory of limits to arbitrage. The GME event, however, provides a textbook example of the failure of arbitrage due to real world impediments supporting the theory of limits to arbitrage. This theory explains why rational actors cannot always instantaneously correct egregious mispricing. There is a noise trader risk, so the primary limitation faced by short sellers was this noise trader risk, meaning that the riskless irrational or speculative investors, the retail crowd or coordinating of social media, would continue to drive the price further away from its fundamental value, resulting in sustained losses for the rational arbitrer. Hedge funds found that the physiological momentum and collective buying power overwhelmed their short selling capacity, forcing them to purchase shares at exorbitant prices to meet margin costs, thus transforming their conviction into catastrophic losses. The traditional EMH definition of rationality fails when faced with the risk of overwhelmingly coordinated irrationality. The second limit was rooted in the microstructure of frictions and capital constraints. The exceptional short interest ratio of 140% meant that the market for borrowing shares was severely constrained and highly expensive, effectively capping the influx of arbitrage capital, or that selling pressure, required to deflate the bubble. Now we're going to talk about the evaluation of systemic profitability. The outcome confirms that the GME anomaly did not offer systematic risk-adjusted profit opportunities for investors attempting to restore efficiency. The rational short sellers who had correctly identified fundamental misvaluation incurred billions of dollars in non-diversible losses, demonstrating that the necessary arbitrage capital was overwhelmed by the combination of noise-triggered momentum and institutional constraints. The GME short squeeze demonstrates a crucial feedback loop. The fundamental weakness of GME, when exploited via aggressive shorting, created the conditions for an acute microstructure weakness, the extreme short ratio. This structural vulnerability then allowed behavioral coordination to detach the price from reality, resulting in a market structure failure rather than a conventional fundamental anomaly. When arbitrage shares lose 53% of their capital, the AMH framework of price correction based on rationality is rendered inapplicable for describing the event. We are nearing the end, but the market microstructure failures and policy implications are evolved. We are first going to talk about the clearinghouse bottleneck in capital requirements. The decisive factor that terminated the GME squeeze was a profound failure in market microstructure. In U.S. markets, trades typically settle two days after execution. During periods of extreme volatility, central clearinghouses, such as the DTCC, required brokerages to post massive collateral margin instantly to mitigate the risk of a counterparty defaulting between trade execution and final settlement. As GME's volatility exploded, Robinhood faced billions of dollars in immediate unforeseen collateral demands. This liquidity crisis forced Robinhood to restrict buying in GME and other new stocks to manage its capital requirements. This decision, stemming from the inability of the existing T-plus-2 system to effectively handle rapid changes in risk, acted as a structural lever that halted the speculative momentum. The impact of trading restrictions and transparency The subsequent asymmetrical trading restriction, allowing selling but blocking buying, introduced immediate downward pressure on GME stock prices, contributing significantly to their retreat from the January 28th peak. The controversy was compounded by a transparency failure. Congressional testimony revealed that Robinhood initially attributed the restriction solely to market volatility, omitting the vital financial requirement issues with the clearinghouse. This lack of candor exacerbated the public perception that the market system was rigged against the retail investor. The intervention highlights that market efficiency can be structurally determined by clearing infrastructure. The GME event shifted regulatory focus toward the underlying mechanisms of settlement. The congressional hearings examined market volatility and the institutional practices involved, focusing on the potential for accelerating settlement processes through the Project ION, for example, as a means of mitigating systemic risk and limiting the formation of volatility bubbles. The GME episode therefore dictates a regulatory imperative to modernize the settlement infrastructure, recognizing that outdated market friction can be the single greatest source of market inefficiency during crises. Behavioral Finance Explanations The Psychology of the Anomaly Behavioral Finance, or BFA, provides the most compelling explanatory framework for the interpretation and persistence of the GME price anomaly. The BFA departs from the image by recognizing that investors are not perfectly rational, but are instead influenced by physiological factors and cognitive biases, which can lead to persistent market inefficiencies. The primary behavioral mechanism driving the GME squeeze was coordinating herding mentality. The subreddit r.wallstreetbets enabled decentralized yet organized collective action among a massive, diffused group of retail traders, a feat previously considered impossible. Herding occurs when investors disregard their own analysis and mimic the actions of a larger group. Often believing the crowd possesses superior informational asymmetry, this collective action was amplified by influentials, a minority of very active users whose positive discourse on the forum correlated strongly with positive GME returns. This dynamic created a powerful psychological momentum, fueled by the fear of missing out, FOMO, and the desire to conform, which inflated the asset price far beyond its intrinsic value, leading to the bubble. The fact that the trading itself was viewed by some as a giant video game underscores the gamification of investing. The low-friction, zero-commission platforms combined with the social, meme-driven coordination fostered an environment where the goal shifted from maximizing risk-adjusted returns to achieving a collective social victory against institutional short-sellers. This lowered the physiological threshold for risk, providing a powerful persistent source of irrationality that overwhelmed fundamental constraints. Now I'm going to go into the cognitive and emotional biases in GME. There are several specific behavioral biases contributed to the GME event. Behavioral biases and market participant impact during squeeze, that hurting mentality, a loss aversion, and a position effect in confirmation bias. The extreme losses suffered by short-sellers, as seen in the 53% drop experienced by Melvin Capital, were exasperated by loss aversion. Despite the rational fundamental analysis indicating massive overvaluation, the hedge fund's inability to close their positions quickly enough due to either capital constraints or psychological reluctance to realize losses turned a fundamental mispricing correction attempt into a catastrophic loss event. EFA, when combined with the limits to arbitrage theory, offers a comprehensive explanation for why the rational market forces failed to correct the mispricing against coordinated physiological momentum. Finally, conclusion. Re-evaluating market efficiency in the digital age, or reflecting in that driver framework, the GameStop short squeeze provides compelling empirical evidence that financial markets, particularly in the context of extreme volatility and digitally coordinated speculation, can deviate massively and persistently from efficiency. The event mandates a shift from relying solely on the theoretical purity of the EMH toward integrated models that account for both behavioral drivers and market microstructure constraints. Again, to go over the synthesis of our findings with each of the three levels of our EMH, that weak-form EMH violated by the existence of exploitable momentum and non-random price correlation driven by social media coordination. For that semi-strong-form EMH, it was violated by the persistent, massive detachment of market price from all verifiable public fundamental valuation metrics. And finally, that strong-form EMH is plausibly violated by inflammation asymmetry pertaining to critical non-public microstructure data that clearinghouse capital requirements that govern the trading restrictions. So, re-validating behavioral finance and limits to arbitrage. The EMH, which assumes rational behavior and unlimited arbitrage capital, fails fundamentally in the GME case. The observed anomaly validates the core tenets of behavioral finance, demonstrating that coordinated cognitive biases hurting in confirmation bias can generate significant sustained price bubbles. Furthermore, the GME event serves as the definitive modern case study for the limits to arbitrage, illustrating that noise trader risk, coupled with acute structural constraints of the 140% ratio and mandatory VR limits, can incapacitate rational arbitrage, allowing mispricing to persist and intensify to catastrophic levels. Market Efficiency Going Forward The GME short squeeze has permanently altered the landscape of market efficiency analysis. It underscores that market efficiency is not a continuous state. The outcome confirms that the GME anomaly did not offer systematic, risk-adjusted profit opportunities for investors attempting to restore efficiency. The rational short sellers, who had correctly identified the fundamental misvaluation, incurred billions of dollars in non-diversifiable losses, demonstrating that the necessary arbitrage capital was overwhelmed by the combination of noise trader momentum and institutional constraints.1 The GME short squeeze demonstrates a crucial feedback loop: the fundamental weakness of GME, when exploited via aggressive shorting, created the conditions for an acute microstructure weakness (the extreme short ratio). This structural vulnerability then allowed behavioral coordination to detach the price from reality, resulting in a market structure failure rather than a conventional fundamental anomaly. When arbitrageurs lose 53% of their capital, the EMH framework of price correction based on rationality is rendered inapplicable for describing the event. VI. Market Microstructure Failures and Policy Implications- Evolve A. The Clearinghouse Bottleneck and Capital Requirements The decisive factor that terminated the GME squeeze was a profound failure in market microstructure: the archaic T+2 settlement system. In US markets, trades typically settle two days after execution. During periods of extreme volatility, central clearinghouses, such as the DTCC, require brokerages to post massive collateral (margin) instantly to mitigate the risk of a counterparty defaulting between trade execution and final settlement.5 As GME's volatility exploded, Robinhood faced billions of dollars in immediate, unforeseen collateral demands. This liquidity crisis forced Robinhood to restrict buying in GME and other \"meme stocks\" to manage its capital requirements.5 This decision, stemming from the inability of the existing T+2 system to efficiently handle rapid changes in risk, acted as the structural lever that halted the speculative momentum. B. Impact of Trading Restrictions and Transparency The subsequent asymmetrical trading restriction—allowing selling but blocking buying—introduced immediate, downward pressure on GME's stock price, contributing significantly to the retreat from the January 28 peak.4 The controversy was compounded by a transparency failure. Congressional testimony revealed that Robinhood initially attributed the restriction solely to \"market volatility,\" omitting the vital financial requirement issues with the clearinghouse.5 This lack of candor exacerbated the public perception that the market system was \"rigged\" against the retail investor.4 The intervention highlights that market efficiency can be structurally determined by clearing infrastructure. The GME event shifted regulatory focus toward the underlying mechanisms of settlement. The Congressional hearings examined market volatility and the institutional practices involved, focusing on the potential for accelerating settlement processes (e.g., through Project Ion) as a means of mitigating systemic risk and limiting the formation of volatility bubbles.5 The GME episode therefore dictates a regulatory imperative to modernize the settlement infrastructure, recognizing that outdated market friction can be the single greatest source of market inefficiency during crises. VII. Behavioral Finance Explanations: The Psychology of the Anomaly A. Behavioral Finance Framework Behavioral Finance (BFA) provides the most compelling explanatory framework for the initiation and persistence of the GME price anomaly. BFA departs from EMH by recognizing that investors are not perfectly rational but are instead influenced by psychological factors and cognitive biases, which can lead to persistent market inefficiencies.6 B. Coordination and Herding Mentality The primary behavioral mechanism driving the GME squeeze was coordinated herding mentality.21 The subreddit r/WallStreetBets enabled decentralized, yet organized, collective action among a massive, diffuse group of retail traders, a feat previously considered impossible.4 Herding occurs when investors disregard their own analysis and mimic the actions of the larger group, often believing the crowd possesses superior information (informational asymmetry).21 This collective action was amplified by \"influentials\"—a minority of very active users whose positive discourse on the forum correlated strongly with positive GME returns.18 This dynamic created a powerful psychological momentum, fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the desire to conform, which inflated the asset price far beyond its intrinsic value, leading to the bubble.21 The fact that the trading itself was viewed by some as \"a giant video game\" 5 underscores the gamification of investing. The low-friction, zero-commission platforms, combined with the social, meme-driven coordination, fostered an environment where the goal shifted from maximizing risk-adjusted return to achieving a collective social victory against institutional short sellers. This lowered the psychological threshold for risk, providing a powerful, persistent source of irrationality that overwhelmed the fundamental constraints. Cognitive and Emotional Biases in GME Several specific behavioral biases contributed to the GME event: The extreme losses suffered by short sellers, as seen in the 53% drop experienced by Melvin Capital, were exacerbated by loss aversion.1 Despite their rational fundamental analysis indicating massive overvaluation, the hedge funds' inability to close their positions quickly enough—due to either capital constraints or a psychological reluctance to realize losses—turned a fundamental mispricing correction attempt into a catastrophic loss event.22 BFA, when combined with the Limits to Arbitrage theory, offers a comprehensive explanation for why the rational market forces failed to correct the mispricing against coordinated psychological momentum.
