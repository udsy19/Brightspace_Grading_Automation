  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrated a complete event-study workflow—estimation/event windows, CAPM alpha/beta estimation, abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return calculations, and statistical testing—implemented in code and interpreted. Minor presentation/code refinements were noted, but the methodological steps and empirical calculations were thoroughly applied, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student executed a complete event-study: clear event window, CAPM-based expected returns, abnormal and cumulative abnormal return calculations, statistical testing, and temporal visualization. Their interpretation—rejection of semi-strong efficiency and sustained abnormal returns—directly addresses the speed and accuracy of information incorporation, meeting the standards for a thorough, knowledgeable treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns using CAPM-based expected returns, produced statistical tests (t‑stats/p‑values), reported a numeric CAR (spike ~4.10) and interpreted significance. They connected the empirical AR/CAR findings to economic interpretation (ex‑post gamble vs. risk‑adjusted opportunity), meeting the standards for a thorough, applied explanation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied and interpreted tests for weak form (autocorrelation) and semi-strong form (abnormal returns/CAR) demonstrating conceptual understanding and empirical application, but did not address or test the strong form explicitly. Coverage is accurate and applied but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (AR/CAR) and produced code and statistical outputs, showing practical implementation. However, under the strict technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block-by-block execution/verification or detailed explanation of code functions—rather they relied on and modified AI-generated code—so the work shows correct attempt but not the required explicit ownership/detail for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal validation (fact‑checking the baseline, iterating code, and reporting statistical tests), demonstrating awareness of data/code checks. However, they did not cite or compare to specific external authoritative sources or tools to externally validate data/results, so validation is present but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Samantha —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from intuition-driven thinking to the deliberate, DRIVER-style approach. Your write-ups consistently tie finance concepts to technology in a way that shows real synthesis: for example, turning a cash‑flow uncertainty discussion into clear decision criteria and proposing an automated sensitivity table to compare scenarios. That concrete bridging of valuation thinking with practical tooling is exactly the systematic thinking we aim for — you’re no longer reacting to problems, you’re framing them so they can be solved reproducibly.\n\nFor your next steps, focus on tightening the technical implementation loop so your strong financial logic is matched by equally clear execution. Practical actions:\n- Break any finance problem into three modules: inputs (assumptions and data sources), logic (rules, formulas, decision thresholds), and outputs (metrics and visual summaries). Document each module in one page.\n- Convert your verbal decision rules into simple pseudocode or flowcharts (e.g., “if revenue decline > X, trigger scenario B”), then implement those rules in a spreadsheet or small prototype. This will expose edge cases early.\n- Practice one business application end-to-end: build a 3‑scenario cash‑flow forecast for a capital project, include trigger-based actions, and run a sensitivity sweep to show how decisions change. That maps directly to FP&A and corporate capital allocation work.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that few students reach — your systematic habits are exactly what employers in corporate finance and fintech prize. Keep treating clarity of logic as the primary deliverable; tools serve that clarity. I’m excited to see how your models evolve into decision-ready systems. Stay curious and iterative — the DRIVER journey continues, and you’re making measurable progress."
