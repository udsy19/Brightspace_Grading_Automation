  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Samantha Paguia and I'll be recording my market efficiency um analysis. So, let's go to there. So, first I started in Google Gemini with the prompt I am a finance student in finance class using the KISS principle and driver framework to investigate the following market efficiency and the prompt is GME short squeeze analysis. So first they wanted us to find out if the statement here was accurate or not. GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020 against actual historical data. Um and if incorrect document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor. So this is incorrect that we found um because you will see that in a little bit. Um but so we wanted this prompt to be structured um guide sequential analyt analytical work starting with the um mandated define and discover stage and explicitly include the critical factchecking step that identified the initial error. Um so this is saying the short squeeze event with late 2020 to January 2021 to test the efficient market hypothesis the EMH which will come up later versus the behavioral finance framework critical fact check and correction um and then it states the initial premises and then the verified baseline is that GME traded in the range of approximately 1.04 to 1.67 67 per share during August 2020 just adjusted for the 2022 split. Um and then the revised analysis premise was that all subsequent analysis must use $1.04 to 1.67 range as the pre-event baseline for calculating returns and assessing market value. And then here are the questions to answer. Um define the official event window from November 1st, 2020 to March 20 31st, 2021. What were the DME price, volume, short interest levels at the start and peak of the event using the corrected baseline? Um given key information and the catalyst given in the problem data requirements. Um yes. And then R represent here is the analytical plan and the data that they gave us. So most of this here so I won't go through all of that too thoroughly. Um, but there's important things here that say like to test for significant autocorrelation um and daily returns. So, kind of what I did was just add different prompts under um each of these data points here to correlate to the required analysis. Yeah. So, I won't go through that too much. Um, and then here's the implementation step. Um what I did was acquire the data. So download and include the GME price, calculate returns to compute the daily log return for GME and the market index. Um calculate abnormal returns. Implement the AR and CAR um calculations and plot results because that was in where is it the requirements down here. So yes um so what I did was integrate a lot of this bottom half sporadically in here um specifically in implementation and then when it prints out like my findings and everything in the ENR so the evaluate and represent and report stage. So yeah um pattern review visually confirmed that the car and volume analysis aligns chronologically with the narrative of the short squeeze event um based on the air and car predictability test. So this is for the EMH clarification under evaluate behavioral framework is to evaluate the extent to which the price movements can be explained by hurting social media influence and limits to uh arbitrage. So collateral requirements, execution restrictions. I just wanted to parenthesize this to make it a little more clear for the open AI system. Um theoretical implications discuss whether GME represents a market failure or an extreme realization of existing market frictions. Compare explanatory power of EMH um versus the behavioral finance approach. And then finally summarize the finding concisely present the evidence for each EMH form. Um policy discussion discuss the implications for active versus passive management and potential market efficiency policy changes. Um the final conclusion should state the ultimate assessment did a systematic um risk adjusted profit opportunity success for a rational investor X anti before the event or was it only a profitable gamble expost after the event. Um, and then I wanted to make sure this was compatible through Python in Google Collab. So, at first it gave me um this, which was a good place to start, but then I had to reprompt it. Um, here it shows the key findings. Um, and then here full Python code to calculate plot statistically test um the car. So, this originally didn't have the car data in it and um some of the plots weren't as efficient as I'd like them to be for this specific problem. So, I wanted it to kind of rewrite it. Then, it gave me this output, but it gave me like multiple outputs. So, I didn't really like that. So, I wanted to adjust the code to become Oh, and then here's just the visualization it will give later, but we'll go over that in a minute. um sorry and the final conclusion here but I wanted to simplify the code into one so I had to reiterate it again um I wanted to keep it very simple too and then I wanted to make sure that um all of the requirements from the original statement were met so I made it recheck that and then I um here you can see where it came out too. Um, so it's just kind of the chart and then this one just gave me the float number which is great but it's um not exactly what I wanted. So I wanted to add my analysis printed at the end of the statement. So then gave me this um well it didn't give me a code at first but it gave me like a Excel sheet. So then I said I wanted to add to my code specifically that was already made and then this was the final code that it gave me and then now we'll go over this a little bit. So first we had to import all the libraries um pandas, numpies, mapplot lib, statistic models um for stats and so those all go into our final output. Um and then first data simulation um this is where we're cleaning all the data and acquiring it as well. 40-day estimation, 60-day event. Um and then the market S&P 500 and GME returns for comparison. Um getting the data frame for the market return. Um using the lock function for um dates and estimated days and the GME return and then finding the event period GME returns high voltity and um squeeze spike. So that's directly measuring the squeeze um for the event to scale. Yes. And then defining indexing for clarity. This is just making sure that um the following steps aren't confused for um indexing specifically. And then abnormal returns ar and c calculations um are the r and i steps of this driver framework specifically model to estimate the capm um parameters using alpha and beta during the estimation period. Um that was a requirement between this was to specifically use um alpha and beta. So had to include that as well. And then wanted to calculate expected returns, abnormal returns and then cumulative abnormal returns um for AR was the abnormal returns and then Q cumulative abnormal returns are C and then I wanted the statistical testing V and E stage initial results um semi- strong form for EMH test car significance here using that tat value and the P value to show significance Um yes and standard error as well. Um using the length function for find the um how long the events were weak form EMH test um autocorrelation again um the p value is going to be very important here to test for significance dynamic column indexing specifically used. And then fourth was a VNR stage. So, um, that's our visualization. Um, it's going to be a line plot here. We'll go over that in a little bit. Um, yes, measuring um the C log returns um with the dates specifically to look at the squeeze. Um, yes. And then we finally wanted to integrate the analysis reporting. So, this is the ENR stages section prints the final results um and interpretation. And something I liked that Google Collab added where the visual little icons here just to like keep it a little more organized. Um maybe I would take it out though if it was through a professional analysis, but since this is just going to like a professor, I feel like it would be okay. Um yeah, specifically including the interchangeable P value, T stat, final car, B stat, P or um sorry, LV, LB p value um and then a few other calculations. So let's go over the findings first and then see how that correlates to our cumulative abnormal returns for GME analysis. So here it says market efficiency testing results. Um what's important here is the conclusion statement. So P is less than 0.05 leading to a rejection of the semi- strong form EMH systemic risk adjusted abnormal um profits were possible and then the weak form EMH test the conclusion was that P is about zero leading to a rejection of the weak form EMH returns exhibited significant serial correlation/momentum theoretical evaluation and interpretation. The analysis shows violation of both weak form predictability and semi- strong form abnormal profit EMH. So the EMA classification is the EMH event represents a clear market failure under the EMH. The price movements were driven not by the fundamental value um Ryan Con's influence but by mechanical short squeeze amplified by social coordination. And then behavioral framework. This event is best explained by a hurting/confirmation bias, meaning that coordinated retail buying social media drove prices far beyond rational um valuation. And we see this a lot um in real time to with examples not from class like um things that kind of just populate without us having any indication of why they do or why the media takes a certain liking to it. even though it goes against um rationale if that makes sense. And then limits to arbitrage. The price spike was sustained because institutional short sellers were constrained by hard margin collateral constant lack of available shares to short preventing rational investors from correcting the mispricing. So the final con conclusion is that the GME short squeeze was an expost profitable gamble, not an X anti- risk adjusted opportunity. Therefore making the original statement from the prompt not true. GameStop um traded at 0.04 in August 2020. Um active versus passive management. While the event provided massive returns for active traders, the high voltality and non-fundamental risk make it an anomaly, not a repeatable strategy for rational active management. Again, that this was kind of something that couldn't be easily predicted. And then policy implications. The event underscores a need for regulatory review of short selling transparency and clearing house margin requirements to mitigate systemic risk posted by extreme behavioral cascades. And then, oh, where did my graph go? Let's look at that real quick. Um, oh, it did not save. Um, let me repaste this. Okay. So the graph that's shown here final CR you can see the high spike jump from January to February. um and the car log returns this calculation is presented to within um the code here. So start of event period as you can see after about a month it spiked far upward for final C being 4.10 which further um just identifies our final conclusion and report that this is an anomaly. So, thank you for listening for um to my market efficiency um analysis here um and to see if it was actually efficient for GME. Thank you.",
