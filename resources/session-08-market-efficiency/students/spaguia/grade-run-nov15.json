  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implemented core event-study steps (estimation/event windows, market model/CAPM parameter estimation, AR/CAR computation, plotting) and conducted statistical inference (t/p-values) with interpretation, showing applied mastery. This coverage is thorough enough to satisfy the criterion for event-study methodology and abnormal-return calculations.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly executed the Define & Discover stage by finding and correcting the baseline data error, stating the research questions, and specifying the event window and estimation parameters. This clear, documented research design meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the DRIVER Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly articulated a concrete research design—event and estimation windows, target variables (price, volume, short interest), and specific methods (market/CAPM model, AR/CAR, autocorrelation tests)—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. This level of detail provides a defensible, operational framework for analyzing efficiency around the event.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses and tests weak- and semi-strong-form EMH (autocorrelation for weak form, CAR/statistics for semi-strong) and draws clear conclusions, showing applied understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for a thorough PASS because the strong-form EMH is not explicitly addressed or evaluated, so the coverage is correct but not comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied appropriate event-study tools (estimation/event windows, market model, AR/CAR, statistical tests) and related CAR timing to the short squeeze narrative, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, the treatment stops short of a thorough, quantitative assessment of incorporation speed/accuracy (e.g., explicit day-of-news AR decomposition, intraday timing, or formal measures of information arrival), so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly invoked behavioral explanations (herding/confirmation bias) and tied empirical CAR/volume patterns to a behavioral narrative, showing conceptual application. However, treatment omits or lacks explicit discussion and depth on several specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) and provides limited examples/mechanisms for each, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Samantha — I’ve been impressed by how you’ve taken the DRIVER framework from instruction into practice. Your work consistently shows clear problem decomposition: you break complex finance questions into the right drivers (revenue growth, margin drivers, working capital), state explicit assumptions, and run focused sensitivity checks. That systematic approach—turning “monkey mind” uncertainty into ordered logic—is exactly the transformation DRIVER aims for. I also noticed you use guardrails (consistent naming, clear inputs) so your models are readable to others — a concrete sign of professional thinking.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (practical, business-focused moves):\n- Tighten financial-concept precision by anchoring assumptions to business evidence: link growth rates to TAM/market-share scenarios or to historical cohort performance. This will make forecasts defensible to stakeholders such as product or investor teams.\n- Make models more decision-ready: convert sensitivity outputs into clear actions (e.g., at what revenue/margin combo does a project become NPV-positive?), so non-technical managers can act on the analysis.\n- Improve integration of analysis with operational workflows: automate one data-validation check (e.g., reconcile revenue drivers to bank/CRM totals) and surface discrepancies in a simple dashboard. That bridges finance insight into day-to-day decisions.\n- Strengthen technical robustness not as an end in itself but as a reliability tool: add simple validation tests (bounds checks, missing-data alerts) so executives trust the numbers in time-pressured meetings.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as execution assistants—your logic is the product. The habit you’re building of decomposing problems, making assumptions explicit, and tying outputs to decisions will set you apart in any finance role. This is a career-defining practice more than a one-off skill; continue iterating on small, business-focused improvements and you’ll keep accelerating. Proud to watch your journey — keep going."
