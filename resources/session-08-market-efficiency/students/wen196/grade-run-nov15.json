However the treatment is uneven and somewhat superficial (some confusion, limited depth in analysis and interpretation), so it meets a correct but basic standard rather than a thorough, comprehensive one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes event-study concepts (post‑announcement drift, abnormal returns) and executed empirical tests (AR graph, t‑test yielding p<0.05), showing practical application. However the methodology description and reporting lack essential detail (estimation/event window, benchmark model, AR calculation formula, statistical controls), and the student expresses uncertainty—so the work is correct but basic, earning PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies information‑incorporation concepts (post‑announcement drift) and ran empirical tests that found significant abnormal returns, indicating slow or incomplete incorporation.

  "personalized_feedback": "Johanna —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered “monkey mind” attempts to a reliable, repeatable approach. In class you consistently broke complex problems into DRIVER-sized chunks, stated assumptions explicitly, and tied model outputs back to business questions (for example, when you connected projected cash flows to capital budgeting decisions). Your written explanations are clearer and more persuasive than earlier in the term—you explain why a metric matters, not just how you calculated it. Those are concrete signs your thinking is becoming systematic rather than ad hoc.\n\nFor next steps, treat the remaining gaps as targeted practice opportunities rather than failures. One technical area needs attention: formalize simple validation steps for your models (sanity checks, breakpoint tests, and one or two out-of-sample checks). In practice this means: (a) maintain a short checklist you run after any model change (inputs, units, edge cases), and (b) produce a one‑page validation note that links model behavior to realistic business scenarios (what happens to ROI if demand drops 20%?). For the DRIVER framework items that need work, explicitly map each project milestone to a DRIVER step before you start (Define objective, Identify drivers, Validate assumptions, Execute model, Review outcomes). That habit will make handoffs to stakeholders and board-level summaries far more credible in a real finance role.\n\nKeep leaning into this process mindset. Employers value someone who can translate messy business problems into disciplined analysis that informs decisions. You’re on a clear trajectory—treat each project as another iteration of the DRIVER loop, and the compounded improvement will show up in both your work and your career opportunities. I’m excited to see where you take this next. —Prof. Zhang"
