  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of all three EMH forms—explicit tests, formulas (return regression; expected return and AR/CAR), empirical examples (analyst estimates, $483 peak, 140% short interest), and interpretation of why arbitrage failed. Given the MODERATE standard allowing conceptual discussion and the presence of implementation and reflection, this meets the threshold for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research question, hypotheses, and secondary objectives and specified data sources, benchmark, and estimation/event windows — fulfilling the Define & Discover stage requirements. They also acknowledged remaining unknowns (event dates, normal risk profile), showing realistic awareness of design limits, so the Define & Discover component is clearly and explicitly demonstrated.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined a replicable framework for event analysis—data, benchmark, estimation/event windows, and the CAPM AR/CAR method—demonstrating a clear Represent stage. They also acknowledged known limitations (split adjustments, unknown exact announcement dates, unstable beta), showing methodological awareness rather than omission, so the Represent criterion is satisfactorily met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and implemented core event-study steps (data selection, benchmark, CAPM-based expected return, AR/CAR calculation) and reported sizable ARs, showing practical understanding. However, methodological gaps remain—insufficient detail on statistical testing of CARs, mixed statements about p-values, and only a qualitative (not corrected) treatment of unstable beta—so the work is correct but incomplete, earning PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and implemented core event-study elements (data, benchmark, CAPM expected return, AR/CAR) and produced empirical examples, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, the treatment is incomplete: exact event/announcement dates and rigorous statistical testing of timing and significance are missing, and unstable beta/inconsistent p-value statements undermine the robustness of conclusions, so the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and explains key biases (overconfidence, herding/noise-trader risk) and links them to empirical results, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete—anchoring, loss aversion, and mental accounting are not explicitly analyzed or supported with examples or measures—so the work is correct but not thorough, yielding PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly checked historical data (downloaded prices, used Yahoo Finance) and corrected a clear numeric error from the prompt, showing verification effort. However, verification was not comprehensive or systematically documented for all numeric claims (some key items and exact event dates remain unverified), so the requirement is only partially satisfied."

  "personalized_feedback": "Kyle —\n\nI want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve moved from scattered ideas to structured analysis. You’ve reliably applied the DRIVER steps: you surface the right decision levers, construct coherent logic paths, and present your assumptions so a business partner can follow the chain from inputs to recommendation. In our recent work you picked relevant financial drivers, linked them to cash‑flow outcomes, and communicated tradeoffs in a way that shows real systems thinking — exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nNow, next steps to keep that momentum. One technical implementation area still needs tightening: focus on making your linkage between assumptions and model outputs more testable and transparent. Practically, for business finance use this by:\n- Building a short sensitivity checklist for each model (key assumptions, direction of impact, plausible ranges) so stakeholders see robustness at a glance.\n- Running two quick scenario summaries tied to business decisions (e.g., conservative vs. aggressive revenue ramps) and writing one clear sentence for each that answers “what should the CFO do differently?”\n- Adding a brief validation note that compares your model’s outputs to a benchmark (historical, industry, or rule‑of‑thumb) and explains discrepancies.\n\nThese are small habits that pay big dividends in capital budgeting, forecasting, and strategic pricing conversations.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails rather than the point — your real strength is turning ambiguity into defensible financial choices. This is a career skill: systematic thinking makes you the kind of finance professional who gets invited into strategy meetings. I’m excited to see where you take this next—keep iterating, and bring me one modeled decision next time we meet so we can sharpen it together.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
