  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined and tested all three EMH forms, described appropriate empirical methods (lagged-return regression, event-study AR/CAR, real-world arbitrage constraints), and applied them to GameStop with concrete results and interpretation. Implementation and reflection evidence show depth and applied understanding beyond a cursory mention, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, applied understanding of event-study methodology (expected return model, AR, CAR), specified benchmark and estimation/event windows, executed calculations in code, and presented quantitative results (e.g., 93% AR, CAR peak) while acknowledging limitations. This combination of method description, implementation, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly described and applied event-study methodology (expected return model, AR, CAR), chose appropriate benchmarks and windows, ran code and reported quantitative AR results, and interpreted frictions that slow information incorporation. This combination of method, implementation, and reflection demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of how markets incorporate new information.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described the abnormal-return methodology, specified inputs/windows, ran code, and reported quantitative AR/CAR outputs, demonstrating an attempted technical implementation. However, under the strict rubric they did not present the actual code, block-level explanations, or clear ownership/debugging details on slides — so the work shows substantive attempt but lacks the explicit, reproducible demonstration required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kyle —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to a disciplined DRIVER approach. You consistently showed deep command of core finance concepts — your breakdown of the valuation problem into drivers, assumptions, and model outputs was crisp and finance-first. I also appreciated how you wove technology into the analysis as a tool: using simple automation to run scenario sweeps and presenting results so they linked clearly to decision levers. Your write-ups followed the DRIVER steps reliably, and your explanations made the logic easy for a non-technical stakeholder to follow.\n\nFor next steps, focus on turning those clear frameworks into operational outputs that business teams can use. Practical suggestions:\n- Build a lightweight prototype that ties your driver table to an output dashboard (even a spreadsheet + a few scripts). The goal is repeatability: one-click scenario updates for FP&A or a product manager.\n- Add structured validation: document key assumptions, implement simple sanity checks (bounds, conservation rules), and keep a one-page data provenance note so others can trust the numbers.\n- Move from static scenarios to sensitivity-focused outputs: identify the top 3 drivers by impact and build quick “what-if” visuals that directly map to business KPIs (EBIT, cash run-rate, unit economics).\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails that make your thinking executable. Systematic thinking will differentiate you in roles that require translating financial insight into operational action — investor diligence, corporate strategy, FP&A, or product finance. This is a long arc; you’ve laid a strong foundation. Keep iterating on practical, repeatable delivery and you’ll accelerate from thoughtful analysis to measurable business impact.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
