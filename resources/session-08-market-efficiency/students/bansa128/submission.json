  "transcript": "Certainly! Here is the transcript of the video: Hello everyone. My name is Krish, and I'll be explaining the analysis on GameStop stock performance in August 2020 and how it connects to the efficiency market hypothesis or EMH. I'll be using the driver framework to organize my explanation that stands for definition, um, relationships, interpretation, validation, evaluation, and reflection. So, let's start with the definition first. So, the efficiency market hypothesis basically suggests the asset prices are fully reflect all available information it has. Um, And the three forms are weak form efficiency, semi-strong efficiency, and strong form efficiency. Prices reflect all uh historical prices, meaning you can't consistently earn profits using past trends or charts, which is weak form efficiency. And um the opposite of that is where prices reflect all information, both public and private, even insider info that is strong form efficiency. My analysis focuses on GameStop's stock during August 2020 by studying how its prices behaved and how information was incorporated in into that price. We can classify how the market responded relative to these EMH forms. Then uh moving on to the R part, I focused on the key relationship between information and price movement. In an efficient market, new information should be reflected in stock prices immediately and accurately. If GameStop GameStop's price responded quickly to changes in public information like earnings reports or trading volume, that supports the semi-strong form of EMH. Uh, but if prices showed delayed reactions of predictable trends, that would uh suggest some inefficiency. By observing the price patterns of uh August 2020, we can analyze whether the market anticipated future changes or overreacted, both of which gives insights into how efficiently the market processed the information. For the interpretation part, I took GameStop's prices in August 2020, didn't show any evidence of extreme undervaluation like the rumored $0.04 per share. Prices were consistently well above that. This means the market was functioning efficiently. Um, and in other words, the claim that GME traded at an unrealistic low price was inconsistent with actual market data. To validate this, um, uh, I even measured the abnormal returns, the difference between stock's actual return and the return expected based on market movements. If abnormal returns occur only around the event date and disappear quickly, the market is considered efficient, but if abnormal returns persist or are predictable, that would challenge the EMH. For GameStop, price adjustments seem consistent with normal market reactions, meaning there was no clear pattern of abnormal or predictable returns during that period. Uh, to evaluate, uh, I saw if the markets are efficient, especially in the semi-strong sense, it's extremely difficult for investors to beat the market consistently using public information. This is why passive investing like holding index funds often out performs active trading after cost and risks are considered. However, in practice, markets aren't perfectly efficient. There are behavioral biases like overconfidence, anchoring, herding, or and loss aversion that can cause prices to deviate temporarily from fair value. In cases like GameStop's later short squeeze, these behavioral factors clearly overpowered rational pricing for a while, showing that even in an over efficient market, psychology can create temporary inefficiencies. To reflect, uh, finally to reflect on the analysis, uh, testing the market efficiency, uh, wasn't just about looking at prices, it's also about understanding how information, behavior, and risk all interact in real-time. We also need to consider a limit to arbitrage. This is where situations where traders can't easily can't easily consider mispricing, correct mispricings because risk, regulation, or costs and asset substitutions are a problem, where leveraged firms might take on excessive risks for the complicating pricing accuracy. The key takeaway is that while financial markets are broadly efficient, they're not perfectly efficient. Information is generally incorporated quickly, but investor psychology and structural limits mean that temporary mispricing can and do occur. So in our analysis of GameStop, prices behaved efficiently in during August 2020, consistent with EMH, but later surge in 2021 reminds us that human behavior can always change theoretically and efficiency theoretical efficiency. To sum up, the driver framework helps break down the break down complex topics like EMH into clear steps, defining the concept, identifying relationships, interpreting results, validating methods, evaluating implications, and reflecting on the broader meaning. By applying the framework, uh I moved just uh moved beyond just uh data and numbers, but also to really understand how markets process information and why efficiency uh matters. Uh I you can see over here I have used uh Python uh in Colab to make my analysis much more simple and easier to understand. Uh so, I have seen uh taken the top five highest positive daily returns and the top lowest negative daily returns uh to make this chart which explains the uh which explains GameStop's daily returns from 2020 to 2023. Um, then uh I have also used various formulas and gone through many loops to come to that conclusion. Um, over here you can see I have used the GameStop's closing price from 2020 to 2023 and you can see how there was a huge rise in 2021, but then it slowly started dipping. Uh so, the reason our reasoning has also been provided in the code. So, it shows how the GME closing prices were plotted successfully and represent the stock's behavior showing significant price movement. The next step is to analyze the visual trends and prepare for in-depth analysis assessment against the market efficiency hypothesis and behavioral finance explanations which includes identifying key periods of interest from the graph. So, which the previous graph I showed you was about that. And moving forward, these are all the formulas which I used and the summary of the GME's historical data when it was going on a low, when it was at a high, when it opened, and the total volume has also been shown. Then the total statistics of the GME in August 2020. Overall, the analysis really helped me understand how GME stocks were going up and down and the whole statistics and gave me a fair idea of how the market works and how investors should invest. Thank you.",
