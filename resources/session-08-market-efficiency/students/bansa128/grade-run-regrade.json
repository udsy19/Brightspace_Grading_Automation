  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines all three EMH forms, applies them to GameStop with a concrete validation approach (abnormal returns) and discusses practical limits and behavioral exceptions. Coverage is conceptually thorough with specific application and methodological intent, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (what is being tested, the timeframe, and the linkage to EMH forms) and explicitly states use of the DRIVER framework to structure the definition/discovery. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission shows a systematic execution: data processing and visualization steps (top/bottom returns, closing-price plots), computed statistics for the target period, and an explicit abnormal-return validation step. While methodological specifics (estimation/event windows, models) are limited, the organized use of code, multiple outputs, and a clear validation purpose meet the moderate Implement requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal returns and the basic event-study rationale and indicates empirical work using code, satisfying conceptual understanding. However, methodological details are missing (no description of expected-return model, estimation/event windows, CAR calculation, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the concept of rapid information incorporation, applies it to GameStop, and reports measuring abnormal returns with code—demonstrating conceptual and applied understanding. However, they omit key methodological details (expected-return model, event/estimation windows, statistical testing, timing granularity), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student states they measured abnormal returns and used code, they do not show explicit execution, block-by-block explanation, choice of expected-return model, event/estimation windows, cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical testing. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration and ownership, the submission fails to provide the necessary implementation details.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Krish — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from intuitive problem-solving to a more DRIVER-style, systematic approach. You consistently decompose problems into clear components (drivers, interactions, assumptions), and your written explanations show you can trace how an input propagates to a financial outcome — exactly the kind of causal thinking finance teams need. Your ability to explain model assumptions (and where they matter) has improved noticeably; that clarity makes your outputs actionable for stakeholders.\n\nLet’s build on that momentum with three practical next steps. First, for the remaining technical implementation gap: adopt a short validation checklist for each model you deliver (sanity checks, edge-case tests, and simple backtests). In business terms, this reduces “model risk” when your forecasts are used for budgeting or investment decisions. Second, expand one of your driver-based models into a scenario matrix (best/base/worst) and quantify sensitivity to the top two assumptions — that exercise strengthens integration of finance and tech and mirrors how CFOs evaluate downside risk. Third, sharpen communication by adding a one-paragraph executive takeaway to every deliverable that answers “What should we do differently?” and “What could break this recommendation?”—this links your systematic analysis directly to decision-making.\n\nYou’re on a meaningful trajectory. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it makes your analyses reproducible, defensible, and scalable across projects. Keep iterating — treat each model as a mini-experiment — and you’ll find organizations leaning on your judgment more and more. I’m excited to see where you take this."
