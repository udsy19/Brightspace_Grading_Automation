  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applied them to the GameStop case, using verified data and a plotted abnormal-return series to justify that publicly available information (short interest, social media) failed to be incorporated—supporting a semi-strong violation. Treatment is detailed and evidence-based (definitions, empirical graph, validation), meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual explanation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (objective, time horizon, data sources, success metric, and benchmark) and documented a concrete plan to test it. This level of explicit definition and planned methodology meets the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student delivered a clear, explicit plan (seven defined steps) tying objective, data scope, methods (visualization, EMH comparison, form determination, behavioral analysis) to execution. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage layout and would allow a reviewer to follow and defend the proposed analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and implemented a basic return-comparison (GME vs. market) and visualized cumulative abnormal-looking returns, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform a formal event-study (no explicit market-model/CAPM estimation window, abnormal-return calculation procedure, cumulative abnormal return computation with statistical tests), so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how public (non-fundamental) information drove price moves and used validated plots to show abnormal returns persisting, demonstrating conceptual grasp of information incorporation. However, they did not perform a formal timing/accuracy test (no event-window market-model estimation, explicit abnormal-return definitions, or statistical tests of how quickly information was reflected), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed code, computed daily and cumulative returns, and validated outputs, showing personal execution of a return-comparison. However, they did not demonstrate explicit abnormal-return calculations (market-model/CAPM estimation, AR/CAR computation, or statistical testing) nor provide block-by-block code understanding or clear ownership beyond using AI to generate the script. Therefore the technical attempt is correct but incomplete.",

The second form is semi-strong form and that states that stocks adjust quickly to absorb new public information, only private information is useful to gain an advantage, and fundamental analysis does not work.

  "personalized_feedback": "Hillary — I’m really impressed by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER framework. You consistently open with a crisp problem statement, lay out assumptions transparently, and sequence your analysis so each step follows logically from the last. Your explanations of model outputs are clear and audience-aware: you translate technical steps into business implications rather than leaving numbers isolated. That systematic approach is exactly the transformation DRIVER aims for — you’re moving from reactive “what-if” thinking to a repeatable decision process.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: deepen the connection between financial concepts and business decisions. Practice mapping specific ratios or cash‑flow changes to concrete managerial actions (e.g., how a 2% margin erosion alters working-capital policy or capital-allocation choices). Run simple scenario and sensitivity analyses that answer stakeholder questions like “At what revenue decline does this project become unviable?” and write a one‑page decision memo that ends with a recommended action and the key drivers behind it. Work through a short case — treasury management or a capex prioritization — and force yourself to defend the assumptions in plain language. These exercises will make your analyses directly usable in FP&A, corporate development, or investor conversations.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is a career multiplier. As you continue to codify problem framing, assumptions, and stakeholder-focused outputs, you’ll move from producing analyses to shaping decisions. I’m excited to see how you translate this discipline into leadership; I’m here to help with cases or feedback on your decision memos when you’re ready. — Professor Zhang"
