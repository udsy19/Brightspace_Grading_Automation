  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applies them directly to the GME case, and supports the conclusion with a quantitative event-study (large cumulative abnormal returns) and discussion of market mechanics. They also consider counterarguments and further tests, demonstrating thorough conceptual understanding and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a correct event-study framework (AR = actual − expected), specifies the expected-return model (CAPM/market model), implements it with validated data/code, and reports quantitative cumulative abnormal returns with interpretation and caveats. This combination of methodology, execution, and reflection meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly links information-incorporation theory to an implemented event study (AR/CAR using CAPM), shows quantitative evidence of mispricing, and explains why public information was not quickly or accurately reflected (borrowing costs, noise-trader risk, structural mechanics). This combination of correct methodology, quantitative results, and thoughtful interpretation meets the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several behavioral biases (prospect theory/loss aversion, confirmation bias, herding/momentum, noise-trader risk) and ties them to the GME episode with quantitative support. However treatment is uneven and several listed biases (overconfidence, anchoring, mental accounting) are not explicitly analyzed or exemplified in depth, so the coverage is solid but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission thoroughly analyzes momentum effects (event study, volume, large CARs) and links them to behavioral and market-structure drivers, but it does not address other anomaly categories (value, size, calendar effects) with comparable detail or examples. Because coverage is correct and substantive for momentum but incomplete across the required set of anomalies, the appropriate rating is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states the CAPM-based abnormal-return framework, describes modular code, and reports validation/output results, indicating practical implementation. However, the submission lacks the strict explicitness required: no clear first-person statement of running/debugging the code, no block-by-block walkthrough of functions or calculations, and limited ownership-level detail. That meets some technical requirements but not the full strict standard, so PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Siri — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve embraced the DRIVER mindset. You clearly translate finance problems into structured workflows: your ability to map valuation logic to data inputs and to leverage technology as an execution assistant shows deep, concrete progress. For example, your habit of breaking a cash‑flow forecast into named drivers and explicitly linking each driver to a data source demonstrates the shift from “monkey mind” intuition to systematic thinking. That clarity makes assumptions auditable and decisions repeatable — exactly what we aim for.\n\nNow, let’s turn that momentum into focused next steps. Your technical implementation is showing progress in one area but could benefit from more consistent, business-ready execution. Practical next steps:\n- Codify a short decision checklist for each model (assumptions, data source, sensitivity ranges, stakeholder owner) so a colleague can reproduce results quickly.\n- Start embedding simple validation rules into your workflow (e.g., sign checks, range checks, reconciliation totals) to catch input errors early.\n- Run and document two sensitivity scenarios that tie directly to a business question (e.g., price shock impact on EBITDA and covenant ratios) and prepare one slide that tells the story for a nontechnical stakeholder.\n\nThese are not coding exercises for their own sake — they’re guardrails that reduce risk when numbers inform real financing or investment decisions.\n\nKeep treating this as a journey. Your systematic approach is already a career differentiator: finance leaders hire people who make reasoning transparent and repeatable. Continue building small, disciplined routines; over time they compound into a reputation for reliable judgment and decisive action. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
