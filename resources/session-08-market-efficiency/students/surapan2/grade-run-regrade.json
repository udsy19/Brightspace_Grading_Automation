  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applied those definitions to a concrete event with an event-study methodology, and drew reasoned conclusions (semi-strong violated) while discussing arbitrage limits and behavioral explanations. Depth of explanation, concrete calculations (CAR) and DRIVER-stage implementation justify a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly described the event-study framework (AR = actual − expected), implemented the methodology in code with data validation, and produced numeric CAR results while acknowledging methodological limits and extensions. This constitutes a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly addressed how public information was (not) incorporated: they defined the semi-strong test, implemented a quantitative event study with data validation, and produced a large numeric CAR (5390%), plus discussed why arbitrage failed. This combination of conceptual framing, applied methodology, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented an abnormal-return calculation (defined AR formula, wrote code, validated data, and reported CAR results), so there is clear technical attempt and outputs. However, the submission lacks the explicit block-by-block code walkthrough, detailed explanation of functions/transformations, and an unambiguous statement of personal execution ownership required by the STRICT rubric—hence PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Siri —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered instincts to the systematic mindset DRIVER is designed to build. You consistently demonstrated precise financial reasoning (your treatment of cost of capital, cash flow drivers, and working capital dynamics was particularly crisp), and you translated those concepts into technology-aware solutions—showing you understand not just “what” the finance is, but “how” to structure it for computation and auditability. Your disciplined use of the DRIVER steps (define, reorder, iterate, validate, explain, repeat) is evident in the way your analyses follow a clear logic trail — that’s a core win: real-world finance decisions need that traceable thought process.\n\nNext steps to accelerate: focus on technical implementation as a tool to make your finance work more repeatable and business-ready. Practical actions:\n- Build a one-page financial model for a small product line (revenue drivers, unit economics, capex schedule). Keep it modular so you can swap assumptions.\n- Add scenario and sensitivity checks (best/base/worst, +/- 10–20% on key drivers) and document the business implications of each scenario for FP&A or product strategy conversations.\n- For every model, write a short “assumptions & validation” note that explains why each input is reasonable and how you would test it with stakeholders or data.\nThese steps connect directly to roles like FP&A, corporate development, and investor reporting—where clarity, repeatability, and defensible assumptions matter.\n\nKeep leaning into DRIVER and using AI as your execution assistant to prototype ideas quickly. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it makes you faster, more persuasive, and more trusted. You’re on a trajectory — treat each model as an experiment, iterate, and the cumulative improvement will compound. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
