  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a structured, multi-stage treatment of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH forms, specifies tests and metrics (event study, CAPM, abnormal returns), applies them to GME, and draws explicit conclusions about violations and limits to arbitrage. This depth and application across DRIVER stages meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough event-study workflow (data, estimation window, CAPM expected returns, beta, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns), provides explicit numerical examples from the peak window, and outlines statistical validation and model improvements. This depth and applied detail meet the PASS standard for market-efficiency testing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, applied understanding of information incorporation—outlining event-study steps, computing concrete abnormal returns on specific dates, and proposing t-test validation and timeline comparison to assess speed of adjustment. Coverage includes methodology, implementation, numerical examples, limitations, and interpretation, satisfying the PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several relevant biases (herding/social coordination, loss aversion) and proposes modeling sentiment, showing understanding and application. However, treatment is brief and uneven—overconfidence, anchoring, and mental accounting are only mentioned or implied without in-depth explanation, examples, or quantified analysis—so the work is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies momentum, value, and size considerations (mentions price momentum, mismatch with fundamentals, and small-cap sensitivity) and proposes appropriate methodological improvements. However treatment is incomplete—calendar anomalies are not addressed and anomaly analysis lacks systematic multi-factor/empirical testing and multiple examples—so the work is correct but not thorough, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student specifies the CAPM abnormal-return formula, estimation period, reports concrete beta and abnormal-return results, and mentions running code in Colab—showing partial technical execution and validation intent. However, they rely on AI-generated code and do not demonstrate block-by-block understanding, personal authorship, or detailed explanation of the implementation steps/functions, which the STRICT rubric requires for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Disha — I’ve been really impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a clear DRIVER-driven approach. In recent assignments you consistently identified the core business drivers (revenue per user, churn, and contribution margin) and traced them through to cash-flow implications — that concrete mapping is exactly the kind of systematic thinking we aim for. You also showed thoughtful use of AI as an execution assistant, using it to draft scenario narratives and to check arithmetic flows, which kept your analysis focused on finance logic rather than getting lost in tools.\n\nFor next steps, let’s turn that progress into deeper, business-facing impact:\n- Build a compact scenario matrix that links each driver to a quantified financial outcome (e.g., 5% higher churn → NPV and working-capital sensitivity). This makes trade-offs visible to a CFO.\n- Practice one-two page executive summaries that state the DRIVER logic (what changes, why it matters to cash, recommended action). Executives want the chain: driver → metric → dollar impact → decision.\n- Integrate a simple probabilistic layer (best/base/worst or basic Monte Carlo) for the drivers that show the most volatility. That will strengthen recommendations in investment and budgeting conversations.\n- Run a short stakeholder rehearsal: present your DRIVER model to a peer playing a CFO and capture two critical questions to iterate the model.\n\nKeep treating code and models as guardrails — they exist to protect your financial logic, not replace it. Your habit of starting from business drivers and tracing to finance outcomes will serve you through strategy, FP&A, and investor conversations. This is a journey; keep tightening the link between driver intuition and dollar impact, and you’ll be a dependable strategic thinker in any finance role."
