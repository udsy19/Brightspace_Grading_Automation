  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a comprehensive, form-by-form treatment of weak, semi-strong, and strong efficiency, specifies empirical tests (event study, CAPM, abnormal/cumulative returns), gives example results, and discusses limitations and validation. These elements demonstrate a thorough conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough event-study workflow: explicit abnormal-return formulas, use of CAPM/ beta estimation, concrete date windows and computed abnormal/CAR examples, and a plan for statistical validation and robustness checks. This level of methodological detail, implemented steps, and critical reflection satisfies the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, methodical plan and applied examples for measuring how quickly and accurately markets reflected information: semi-strong tests tied to event timing, explicit abnormal-return / CAR calculations with sample results, and a stated statistical validation procedure. They also note limitations and robustness improvements, satisfying a thorough, PASS-level treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (formulas, CAPM setup, estimation window, reported AR/CAR values) and ran AI-generated code to produce outputs, so work is present and partially verified. However, under the strict technical standard they did not demonstrate block-by-block code understanding, explicit personal ownership of implementation, or explicit verification steps (e.g., showing t-test results or explaining functions), so the submission meets PARTIAL but not PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly includes a Validate stage, describes planned statistical tests and external benchmarking, and reports correcting a factual data error—evidence of validation effort. However, they do not name or cite specific external sources/tools used for verification or benchmarking (only \"some research\"), so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS under the criterion requiring explicit external validation.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Disha —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted from scattershot intuition to a repeatable, finance-first process. You consistently applied core financial concepts—cleanly breaking down cash flows, cost of capital, and risk-return tradeoffs—and you translated those ideas into actionable outputs (your valuation logic and scenario narratives were especially crisp). I also noticed real strength in integrating tools and workflow: you used technology as an execution assistant to organize assumptions and run alternate cases rather than treating it as an end in itself. Finally, your adherence to the DRIVER steps is nearly complete — your work shows the systematic scaffolding we teach: define, research, iterate, validate, execute, report.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Harden your model documentation: for each valuation or forecast, attach a one-page assumptions map that a CFO could read in 60 seconds. That reduces review friction in real meetings.\n- Expand scenario analysis into decision triggers: translate “what if” outcomes into clear actions (e.g., at X% margin decline, pause hiring; at Y% revenue shortfall, defer CapEx). That connects your analysis to real corporate choices.\n- Validate assumptions with quick market tests: pull 3 historical analogs or short industry benchmarks to triangulate growth and margin assumptions. This strengthens credibility when you present to stakeholders.\n- Build a repeatable review checklist (inputs, calculations, outputs, communications) so every deliverable follows the same guardrails.\n\nKeep going — this is a career-defining habit. Systematic thinking makes you faster, more persuasive, and far more reliable in FP&A, investment analysis, or strategy roles. Treat today’s work as iterations in a long-running portfolio: each model, memo, or meeting is an opportunity to refine your process. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next."
