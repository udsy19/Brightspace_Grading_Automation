  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Jorge Navarro and this is my video presentation for the Market Efficiency Investigation assignment for Management 310. My analysis uses the GameStop short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 as a real world test of the Efficient Market Hypothesis evaluated using the six-stage DRIVER framework. In this video, I walk through each DRIVER stage in order while explaining the outputs and findings generated by my Python script that I have created. So, let's begin with um stage one of DRIVER. And um this is the first stage right here. This is the code of it. Um the Define and Discover stage establishes the research foundation before any implementation. Um so I began by verifying the assignment's critical first claim which was that GameStop traded at $0.04 cents in August 2020. So using Yahoo Finance historical price data, adjusted for the 4:1 split, my script confirms that this is incorrect. As you can see down here in the output, my script confirms that this is incorrect. Um, August 2020 prices ranged from approximately $1.04 to $1.67, with the lowest price of all 2020 being $0.85 cents in April, not $0.04 cents. So, this corrects the prompt's error by a factor of about 25. So, next I define the research questions and hypothesis. Weak-form EMH prediction: no predictable returns from past price or volume data. Semi-strong EMH prediction: publicly available information uh short interest greater than 140%, Ryan Cohen's acquisition, fundamental estimates, should be efficiently incorporated. Strong-form EMH prediction: is that all public and private information should already be reflected in price. I also identified the alternative hypothesis which is behavioral factors such as herding, sentiment amplification, overconfidence, and narrative-driven trading, may better explain the event especially when combined with limits to arbitrage. This completes the define and discover stage before any of the code is executed itself um past the define and discover stage. So now let's go to stage two of DRIVER which is um Represent and in this stage um this is where I document the analytical plan laying out the technical road map um and I structured the project as follows. So first as you can see right here um I downloaded the daily price and volume data for GME and the S&P 500 index. I computed daily log returns, CAPM-based expected returns, abnormal returns, and cumulative abnormal returns or CAR. Um I define the pre-event, event, and post-event windows. Then I performed statistical diagnostics, including return autocorrelation uh volatility patterns, and distribution checks. I also generated three primary visualizations um the log -scale adjusted price, daily volume, and CAR, and then the pre-script structured outputs for the Validate, Evolve, and uh Reflect stages so that each stage is evidence-based and analytically grounded. So, by establishing a rigorous event study approach at this stage, the analysis aligns fully with the DRIVER requirement that Represent must proceed before Implementation. So now what we're going to do is head over to the Implementation stage of DRIVER or stage three. And as you can see in the code here, this is where the script executes the full analytical plan that I created. After downloading the historical data successfully, the script prints descriptive statistics confirming the the corrected August 2020 price range. The script also confirms that the split adjusted peak price during the squeeze is $120.75. And that is confirmed down here in the output um as you can see right here. And um this corresponds exactly to the pre-split high of $483, validating consistency between raw and adjusted data sets. So now let's go to the um to the visualization outputs that I have created. So um we have a log-scale price chart showing the extreme price shift which is over a 100 times change and then a volume chart showing a spike over 10 times the prior average um corroborating the surge in retail attention. So what I've done is to strengthen the statistical rigor, I also examined autocorrelation returns (lag-1 autocorrelation). Um, the value was statistically small and not strongly significant, demonstrating that predictable patterns in returns were limited. Moreover, abnormal returns during the squeeze period significantly exceeded the standard deviation of returns in normal-market windows, confirming that deviations fell far outside typical noise levels. These results provide quantitative evidence essential for the Validation stage. So, here are the outputs that provide that information and um as you can see here is the peak of $86 and then I have the red which um the red highlighted part which correlates the two. So now let's move on to stage four which is Validate and um in Validate I interpret database results against EMH predictions. So first we have Weak-form efficiency. Autocorrelation tests show um low and inconsistent predictability. While momentum appeared during the extreme volatility, it did not provide reliable risk-adjusted opportunities. Therefore, there is no strong statistical violation of weak-form EMH. And uh this is all said down here in my output for um for validate stage right here. Then we have um Semi-strong form efficiency and this form shows the clearest failure. Key information, publicly known short interest, Ryan Cohen's stake, and fundamental valuation ranges, was available months before the surge. Yet prices did not incorporate this information efficiently. CAR results confirm the presence of large abnormal returns exceeding historical volatility bands. The delayed reaction to well-known public information constitutes a direct semi-strong- form violation. Then we have Strong-form efficiency. Strong form EMH fails automatically if semi-strong fails. Additionally, the magnitude of abnormal returns, many standard deviations above expected levels, confirms that all information was not fully reflected in prices. So now let's go down to the Evolve stage. And um in this stage I have explained that EMH alone cannot fully explain the GME event. Stage five integrates behavioral finance and market microstructure insights. Um herding behavior was visible via coordinated retail sentiment on social media which is uh \"Apes together strong,\" or \"HODL,\" and overconfidence surfaced among traders who believe sentiment alone could sustain price increases. Confirmation bias reinforced bullish narratives and filtered out contradictory information. The most important factor is limits to arbitrage. Even if rational investors recognized mispricing, they cannot reliably correct it because: shares became extremely difficult to borrow. Volatility drove margin requirements sky-high. Short sellers faced unlimited potential losses, and trading restrictions, like Robin Hood halts, prevented timely arbitrage. So therefore, ex-ante predictable profits for rational investors were not systematically available. The event produced extraordinary ex-post profits for some traders, but without predictable risk-adjusted signals ahead of time. So now let's go to the final stage of DRIVER, which is Reflect and this is my synthesis and conclusion. In this stage, I synthesized the full analytical process. The investigation began with verifying a factual error in the prompt and proceeded through a rigorous event- study methodology built on DRIVER. The findings show that while financial markets are generally efficient, extreme psychological, structural, and microstructural conditions can cause temporary but large deviations from fundamental value. GME's short squeeze represents a clear breakdown of semi-strong efficiency. Integrating EMH with behavioral and structural explanations provide the most accurate understanding. Overall, the DRIVER framework enabled a structured, data-driven evaluation, connecting market theory, empirical results, and real- world complexities. And this concludes my video presentation on this um investigation for Management 310. Thank you.",
