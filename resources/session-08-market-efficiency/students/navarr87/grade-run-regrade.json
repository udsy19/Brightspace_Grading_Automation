  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, implements appropriate tests (autocorrelation, abnormal returns/CAR), and interprets outcomes relative to each form—finding weak-form largely upheld and semi-strong violated with supporting empirical evidence. The analysis is specific, applied, and integrates DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student implemented a standard event‑study workflow (data, log returns, CAPM-based expected returns, abnormal returns/CAR, defined windows) and ran diagnostics showing abnormal returns well outside normal volatility, demonstrating correct application. While some low‑level estimation details (e.g., beta estimation window, test statistics) are not reported, the methodological coverage and empirical evidence are thorough enough under the course's moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies information that was publicly available prior to the squeeze, implements an event‑study (CAR) to test incorporation, and shows large delayed abnormal returns—concluding a semi‑strong failure. They also provide microstructure explanations (limits to arbitrage) that account for slow/imperfect incorporation, meeting the thoroughness expected under the course's moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and executed abnormal‑return calculations (log returns, CAPM expected returns, abnormal returns, CAR) and reported empirical diagnostics, so the implementation is present. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanation or the clear first‑person affirmation of stepwise execution/verification required for a full PASS, so the evidence supports PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jorge — I want to start by celebrating how clearly your thinking has shifted. You consistently applied core finance concepts (cash-flow vs. accrual distinctions, risk/return tradeoffs, and valuation logic) in ways that showed real understanding, not just memorization. You also demonstrated the DRIVER habits: breaking problems into clear subquestions, making assumptions explicit, and using checkpoints to validate results. Your use of technology as an execution assistant — for example, structuring worked examples and using tools to automate repetitive calculations — made your analysis cleaner and easier to audit. Those are concrete signs of systematic thinking.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on strengthening the technical implementation layer so your finance logic scales in real business settings. Practical, bite-sized actions:\n- Build one end-to-end model for a simple business case (3-year forecast, capex schedule, and DCF) and document each assumption in a single “logic guardrail” sheet.\n- Add sensitivity and scenario tabs (best/base/worst) and produce a short memo that connects scenario outcomes to business decisions (e.g., hiring, pricing, capital raises).\n- Automate one repetitive input (historic revenue series or macro assumptions) and include a quick validation routine that flags implausible values.\nThese are directly applicable to roles in FP&A, corporate development, and startup finance—where documenting assumptions and running scenarios drive decisions.\n\nKeep treating this as a journey. The systematic habits you’re building will compound: clear problem decomposition, explicit assumptions, and repeatable checks turn uncertainty into manageable decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next—pick a real company or project, iterate, and bring me your first end-to-end model when you’re ready."
