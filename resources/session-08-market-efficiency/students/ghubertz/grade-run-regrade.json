  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, listed clear objectives, and provided an actionable plan and data source—satisfying the strict requirement for Define & Discover. Evidence shows concrete framing and planned execution rather than vague intent.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided an explicit, actionable plan (represent stage) including data source, stepwise tasks, and reporting/visualization steps, meeting the strict requirement for a clear plan/layout. The representation is concrete enough that a reviewer or stakeholder could follow and reproduce the intended analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, repeatable workflow: data acquisition, filtering for target windows, fact verification, and visualization—producing concrete outputs (verified prices and plotted graph). This demonstrates systematic implementation of their Python analysis plan, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies EMH forms, cites the semi-strong violation, and uses actual historical data to inform conclusions (IMPLEMENT + DISCOVER). However the treatment is high-level and inconsistent (brief, sometimes contradictory claims about weak/strong form violations) and lacks thorough, systematic argumentation and multiple supporting analyses required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed an event-study question and implemented data retrieval and visualization, but did not perform formal event-study steps (no estimation window, expected-return model, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, nor significance testing). This shows conceptual understanding and basic application but lacks the methodological depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed information-incorporation as an empirical question and implemented data retrieval and visualization (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT). However, they did not measure market reaction speed or accuracy formally (no intraday/event-window analysis, no abnormal-return/timing metrics), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Graham — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving toward a disciplined, DRIVER-style approach. In your recent work you consistently broke problems into definable objectives, laid out assumptions, and communicated your reasoning steps — those are concrete signs of emerging systematic thinking. I also noticed clearer financial concept use (you’re applying NPV and working-capital ideas more consistently) and your write-ups now explain trade-offs rather than just presenting numbers. Those are high-leverage strengths: they make your analysis interpretable to managers and ready for business decisions.\n\nFor next steps, focus on three practical areas that will multiply your impact:\n1. Technical implementation robustness — add simple validation and sanity checks to your workflows (e.g., confirm units, check negative cash flows where impossible, and test edge scenarios). These guardrails prevent small model mistakes from producing misleading recommendations in budgeting or valuation.\n2. Integration of finance and technology — make explicit how each model output maps to a business KPI. For example, translate scenario outputs into projected free cash flow, runway months, or EBITDA impact so non-technical stakeholders can act on your analysis.\n3. DRIVER fidelity — keep documenting your highest-impact assumptions and the decision rule you’re optimizing (maximize value per dollar, minimize downside probability, etc.). That makes stress-testing and stakeholder conversations far more efficient.\n\nCarry this forward by treating every project as a mini-experiment: define the decision, state the assumptions, run focused checks, and translate results into a one-line business recommendation. This mindset — not perfect code or flawless models — is what will distinguish you in finance roles. You’re on a clear trajectory; keep iterating, and you’ll turn this systematic framework into a career-defining advantage."
