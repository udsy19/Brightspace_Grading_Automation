  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, states measurable goals (verify prices, test EMH forms, evaluate profitability), and lays out a concrete research design (data source, time window, verification and plotting steps). Those explicit D & R statements and the outlined workflow satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly links EMH theory (identifying a semi‑strong form violation and implications for profit opportunities) with behavioral finance mechanisms that explain the anomaly, and states the practical conclusion about investor profitability. This clear, explicit synthesis across theory and observed behavior satisfies the strict Reflect requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and ties the case study evidence (public short-interest and price surge) to a semi-strong violation, showing conceptual understanding and data verification. However the treatment is high-level and lacks deeper, systematic analysis or multiple supporting tests/examples required for a thorough PASS, so the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected and plotted price data and stated an intent to test EMH, but there is no evidence of event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, expected-return model) or any abnormal-return or cumulative abnormal return calculations or statistical testing. Because the required methodological steps and quantitative abnormal-return analysis are missing, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding—identifying that public information and market reaction relate to semi-strong efficiency and verifying price data—but treatment is qualitative and lacks explicit timing/accuracy analysis (no event-window returns, intraday timing, or statistical measures of speed of incorporation). Because the concept is addressed correctly but not analyzed in depth quantitatively, PARTIAL is appropriate.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Graham —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a clear, repeatable process. You’ve shown concrete strengths: your problem decomposition follows the DRIVER steps reliably (you frame the decision, identify drivers, and structure assumptions), your write-ups translate model outputs into business implications, and you’ve started using AI thoughtfully as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. Those habits — defining the decision, isolating the drivers, and mapping outputs back to stakeholder questions — are exactly the systematic thinking we want.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Financial concepts: Revisit the economic logic behind NPV/IRR and cash flow timing. Practice reconciling a simple three-year cash-flow projection to an NPV table and explain how timing shifts change valuation — this is what CFOs need when debating project timing with operations.\n- Technical robustness: Build quick model checks for one of your analyses (e.g., cash conservation check, margin sanity checks, and a break-even calculation). These lightweight guardrails reduce errors when you present to non-technical executives.\n- Integration of finance & tech: Translate one scenario analysis into a business recommendation — run a best/worst/base case and write the one-paragraph memo a CEO would read. That closes the loop between model outputs and decision-making.\n\nKeep treating this as iterative practice: each case you do, tighten one assumption, add one check, and reduce one sentence of ambiguity in your recommendation. Systematic thinking like yours is what lets finance professionals make defensible, fast decisions under uncertainty. I’m excited to see how you turn these next steps into habits — you’re on a trajectory that will pay off in real business settings. Keep going; this is a career skillset that compounds."
