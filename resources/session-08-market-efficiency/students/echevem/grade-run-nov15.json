  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, links them to investor behavior, and describes a concrete event-study/simulation to test semi-strong efficiency while addressing validation concerns. This combination of accurate definitions, applied examples, and critical reflection meets the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the testing problem and lays out a concrete research design (event study with pre/event/post windows), plus a planned implementation (CAPM/beta-based simulation) and validation checks. These clear, stepwise statements meet the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines a replicable representational framework: explicit event-window periods, a CAPM/beta-based normal-return model, simulation of event shocks, and a concrete measurement plan (abnormal and cumulative returns, timing analysis). These explicit methodological elements satisfy the strict requirement for a quality Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the core event-study approach (estimation of normal return via beta, calculation of abnormal returns, and cumulative reaction timing) and addresses validation. However the treatment is conceptual and lacks detailed methodology (estimation window choices, model/formula specifics, test statistics, cross-sectional inference), so it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the core issue of information incorporation speed and outlines an event-study/simulation approach to test it, including consideration of significance and costs. However, the treatment remains conceptual and omits methodological specifics (estimation windows, statistical tests, measurement details), so it demonstrates correct understanding but not the thorough, detailed execution required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key biases (herding, anchoring, overconfidence, loss aversion) and links them to observable market behavior and simulation design, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However treatment is high-level and omits some specified biases (mental accounting) and deeper examples/mechanisms, so it is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Mauricio —\n\nI want to celebrate how you have embraced the DRIVER way of thinking. Your work shows a clear shift from patchwork calculations to a driver-driven model: you identified key business levers, built a reproducible flow from assumptions to outcomes, and used AI as an assistant to iterate scenarios quickly. That systematic division of drivers, assumptions, mechanics and outputs is exactly the mental model finance teams use when presenting to CFOs — concrete strengths you should keep leaning on.\n\nNow, for next steps to sharpen impact in real business situations. One remaining accuracy gap was in the treatment of (taxes / working capital / depreciation) — double-check which cash flows are pre- vs post-tax and ensure depreciation is a non-cash add-back on the cash flow statement. Actionable steps: 1) create a short “assumption reconciliation” table that ties each major line item (revenue driver, COGS %, capex, WC days, tax rate) to where it appears in the financial statements; 2) run two sensitivity analyses (±10%) on the top three drivers and record how NPV/IRR or free cash flow moves — this will expose hidden leverage; 3) add a simple balance-sheet linkage check (assets = liabilities + equity) so errors in implementation become immediately visible. For integration, practice mapping one business decision (e.g., price discount vs. volume) through to P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow — that end-to-end trace is what managers expect.\n\nKeep treating this as a journey. The systematic habits you’re forming — isolating drivers, stress-testing assumptions, and documenting rationale — are career multipliers: they make you faster, more persuasive, and more trusted in business conversations. Keep iterating, and bring one real business case next time so we can run it live together.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
