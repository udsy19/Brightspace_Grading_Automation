  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, correct definition of weak/semi-strong/strong EMH and applies it to a concrete event-study method and simulation, showing both conceptual understanding and practical application. The submission also discusses validation and limitations, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes an event-study approach (event windows, expected vs actual returns), a concrete implementation plan (beta-based normal return, simulation, abnormal return aggregation), and appropriate validation steps (statistical tests and economic/transaction-cost checks). This demonstrates a thorough, practical understanding of event-study methodology consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains speed-of-incorporation concepts (immediate vs. gradual reaction), outlines a concrete event-study implementation to measure abnormal returns and timing, and contemplates under/overreaction and validation — demonstrating thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student only describes planning and conceptual steps for abnormal-return calculation without any explicit demonstration of having run code, shown outputs, or explained code blocks and verification. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring personal execution and block-level understanding, this is insufficient, so the criterion fails.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student describes concrete validation checks and an awareness of robustness tests, showing intent to validate results. However, they do not cite or compare outputs to any specific external sources/tools (e.g., databases, calculators, benchmark studies), so validation is described but not externally demonstrated, which warrants PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student presents a logical, testable plan for collecting and interpreting empirical evidence (event windows, abnormal-return aggregation, significance and robustness checks), demonstrating understanding of how evidence should be presented. However, no actual empirical outputs, tables, or results are shown or discussed, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Mauricio — I want to start by celebrating how clearly your thinking has shifted. You consistently apply core finance ideas with precision: your valuation logic, treatment of risk, and use of causal drivers in cash-flow reasoning are all consistently accurate. Equally notable is how you bring technology into the analysis as a supporting tool — you frame questions so that data and simple automation serve decision-making, not the other way around. And your adherence to the DRIVER steps is evident: you define the problem, isolate drivers, and link them through coherent logic chains. That systematic approach is exactly what turns a “monkey mind” into a reliable analyst.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (framed as opportunities, not shortcomings): translate that logic-first approach into reproducible decision procedures you can run in a business setting. Concretely:\n- For any valuation or scenario, write a one-page assumptions checklist and a short validation routine: what inputs matter most, how they are measured, and a quick plausibility test for outputs.\n- Build small, repeatable experiments: pick a business question (e.g., three-year cash-flow sensitivity to price changes), outline the driver map, and run two controlled scenarios to demonstrate how decisions change.\n- Embed simple guardrails around model outputs: threshold flags (e.g., negative working capital), ranges of key drivers, and a “sanity check” summary for stakeholders.\n\nThese steps keep the emphasis on robust thinking while making your analyses trustworthy and actionable for managers and investors.\n\nKeep treating models and scripts as tools that execute your financial logic. That mindset — clarity of drivers, reproducibility of steps, and defensible assumptions — will compound in your career. You’re on a strong trajectory; keep experimenting with small, business-focused procedures and you’ll consistently turn insight into impact."
