  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes and executes the data preparation and abnormal-return calculations, produced plots of daily abnormal returns and CAR, and shows console output validating execution. While code blocks aren't shown, the transcript documents personal execution, block-level descriptions (percentage change, rolling std, abnormal return = asset − market), and validation—meeting the strict requirement for attempted abnormal-return calculation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, lists concrete objectives, and sets clear temporal and benchmark boundaries—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. They provided sufficient detail to defend the problem definition and scope.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan for representing the data (sources, adjustments, alignment, timeline, and transformations), meeting the strict requirement for a defined Represent stage. The described steps are specific and actionable, so the representation criterion is satisfactorily demonstrated.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and applies EMH concepts to an event study (abnormal returns, CAR) and explicitly targets semi-strong efficiency, showing practical understanding. However, treatment is brief and lacks thorough, formal definitions or comparative tests of weak vs. semi-strong vs. strong forms and deeper empirical nuance, so it meets a correct but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements core event-study elements (adjusted prices, return calculation, abnormal returns vs. market, CAR) and structures the work via DRIVER, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, the submission omits methodological rigor (no market-model estimation details, event/estimation window specification, or statistical significance tests), so it is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies event-study concepts (adjusted prices, abnormal returns, CAR) and uses DRIVER stages to structure analysis of information incorporation, showing conceptual understanding. However, the work omits key methodological details (estimation/event window specification, expected-return model calibration, and statistical significance/timing tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Frankie — I loved how you moved from ad-hoc answers to a structured, repeatable process. Your submission clearly used the DRIVER mindset: you decomposed the valuation problem into discrete modules (cash-flow projection, discounting, terminal value), and your model logic acted as a guardrail so assumptions couldn’t silently break outputs. Concrete strengths I noticed: you made assumptions explicit, built modular functions so each step could be tested independently, and included sensitivity runs that showed you think in scenarios rather than single-point guesses. That’s exactly the systematic thinking we want to see.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on tightening the finance-to-business link. Practical action items:\n- Revisit discount-rate choices: map each component (beta, country premium, capital structure) to observable market data and document the rationale you would give to a CFO.\n- Strengthen the interpretation layer: for each scenario, write a one-paragraph decision memo that answers “If this happens, what should the company do?” — e.g., defer investment, hedge exposure, or pursue M&A.\n- Add validation checks: compare model-implied multiples or ROIC to peer benchmarks and flag large divergences for review.\n- Turn sensitivity outputs into decision thresholds (e.g., NPV positive only when oil price > X), so model results translate into actionable triggers.\n\nKeep building this habit: the same structured approach will let you move from producing models to making business recommendations. Treat each project as an iteration — run, learn, document, and refine. I’m excited to see how you’ll apply this in real company decisions; your systematic toolkit is now a career multiplier."
