  "transcript": "Today I'll be analyzing the 2020-2021 GameStop short squeeze to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and I'll be utilizing the DRIVER framework to structure this analysis logically. My primary objectives are to verify historical price claims, calculate abnormal returns relative to the S&P 500, and determine if this event violated semi-strong form market efficiency. So we start with the Define and Discover stage. Here I am establishing the boundaries of the analysis. First, I import the necessary libraries Yfinance for data and Pandas for manipulation, shown right here. I have set the analysis timeline from August 1st, 2020 to February 28th, 2021. August 1st is when GameStop was near bankruptcy levels, and February 28th was after the initial squeeze subsided. Crucially, I'm defining the specific claim given in the assignment prompt to be verified that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020. I've set a variable claim_price to 4 cents to test this programmatically. Finally, I defined the S&P 500 Trust as our market benchmark to represent the rational market return for our efficiency comparison. This leads us to the Represent stage. The goal here is to fetch raw data and structure it into a format suitable for an event study. I'm pulling the Adjusted Close data. This is critical because GameStop underwent a 4-for-1 stock split in 2022. If we looked at the raw 2020 prices without split adjustments, our analysis would be factually incorrect. In the dataframe construction, I align the GameStop price, the market price, and the volume data. I then calculate the daily returns using the percentage change function. This transforms the raw prices into return data, which allows us to compare the volatile stock against the stable market benchmark. That leads us to the I stage Implement. This is where we execute the core financial calculations. First, I isolated the August 2020 data to perform the verification logic on the 4-cent claim price. Next, I calculate the volatility using a 7-day rolling standard deviation. This quantifies the risk introduced during the squeeze. Most importantly, I calculated the Abnormal Return. In financial theory, the Abnormal Return is the difference between the asset's return and the market return. If the market is efficient, the numbers should hover near zero, meaning the information is instantly priced in. Large, sustained deviations here will serve as our evidence of inefficiency. I also implemented a volume moving average to detect the liquidity changes associated with the retail trading surge. V the Validate stage. This is where we actually execute the code and get some graphs. First, looking at the console output right here, you can see the boolean check for the 4-cent claim returned False. The actual split-adjusted low in August 2020 was approximately $1.14. This confirms the prompt statement was factually incorrect and likely referred to the pre-split figure without proper adjustment. Looking at our first chart here, we observe the decoupling of price from fundamentals. The blue bars represent the 10-fold increase in volume driven by retail investors on Reddit, and the price action follows a hyperbolic trajectory that cannot be explained by the weak-form efficiency of past prices. On the second chart, the Daily Abnormal Returns, the purple line shows daily deviations from the market. We see massive spikes of volatility where returns exceed 50 to 100% in single days. This validates the market was not efficiently processing information, but rather reacting to liquidity flows and short squeeze mechanics. In the Evolve stage, we advance this analysis to look at the Cumulative Abnormal Returns, or CAR. This green chart represents the aggregate wealth transfer during the event. In a strong or even semi-strong efficient market, this line would be relatively flat as price corrections would happen instantly. Instead, we see a sustained upward trend that persists for weeks. This serves as empirical evidence of limits to arbitrage. Even though rational investors likely knew the stock was overvalued at $483, the risk of shorting prevented them from correcting the price. This confirms a breakdown in market efficiency due to behavioral factors. Finally, the Reflect stage. This is where we summarize our findings to conclude the assignment. First, Data Verification The assignment prompt's claim of a 4-cent share price is proven false via historical data analysis. Two, Market Efficiency Status This event illustrates a violation of semi-strong form efficiency. Publicly available information was used to generate abnormal profits, which shouldn't happen if prices perfectly reflect all public data. And Behavioral Factors The data supports behavioral finance theories over the EMH. Herding behavior and social sentiment created a feedback loop that rational arbitrageurs could not immediately correct.",
