  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student produced multiple clear visualizations (price with volume, daily abnormal returns, and CAR) and explicitly described their features and implications, linking visuals to quantitative measures. This combination of plotted outputs and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for a PASS in visualization of abnormal returns and cumulative effects.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research problem, objectives, time window, and the testable claim (including a programmatic variable), and identified the market benchmark and data adjustments—meeting the strict requirement for clear Define & Discover stage demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit framework for event‑study analysis: defined timeline, use of split‑adjusted prices, alignment of asset/market/volume series, and daily return construction—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. These elements constitute a practical, defendable data framework for testing market efficiency around a specific event.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the semi-strong EMH concept (links public information to abnormal returns) and computes relevant metrics, but treatment of the three EMH forms is incomplete: weak and strong forms are only briefly mentioned without clear definitions or comparative examples. This shows correct understanding but not the thorough, multi-faceted coverage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, relevant event‑study steps (adjusted prices, return calculation, market benchmark, abnormal returns and CAR) and applies them in the Implement/Validate stages, showing conceptual mastery. However, the methodology lacks key thorough details for a full event-study (no explicit estimation window or expected‑return model specification/regression, and no statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual linkage between abnormal returns/CAR and information incorporation and implements core measures (adjusted prices, market benchmark, daily abnormal returns) — evidence from Discover/Represent/Implement stages. However, the analysis lacks methodological depth on timing (no event/estimation windows, intraday timing, expected‑return model specification, or statistical significance tests), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Frankie — I noticed how you moved from an exploratory approach to a clear, repeatable process. Your work consistently framed problems before diving into numbers: you stated assumptions, separated inputs from outputs, and produced scenario tables that made trade-offs visible. That explicit separation of logic and calculation is exactly the DRIVER transformation I want to see — you’re thinking like a finance professional who can explain “why” as well as “how.”\n\nNext steps to deepen that strength: treat the model as a decision memo, not just a spreadsheet. For the financial-concepts item that needs work, add a one‑paragraph economic intuition for each key result (e.g., why free cash flow changes under scenario B). Practically, build three quick checks you run after any model change: 1) units and sign checks (cash in vs. cash out), 2) base-case vs. sanity-case comparison (does growth > cost of capital imply rising valuation?), and 3) a sensitivity sweep on the top 2 drivers (price and volume, or margin and discount rate). For the technical and DRIVER-following gaps, explicitly label each section of your submission with the DRIVER step you’re executing and include a 2–3 line guardrail: “If X assumption changes, then re-run this sheet and update the conclusion.” These are small habits that avoid big decision mistakes in real business settings — budgeting, valuation, and capital-allocation conversations all reward that discipline.\n\nKeep leaning into systematic thinking. The ability to turn messy business problems into repeatable analyses will make you indispensable in any finance role. This is a journey — you’re past the chaotic stage and building durable habits. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in the next assignment."
