  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly framed the weak/semi‑strong/strong EMH question, executed appropriate empirical tests (event study, multi‑factor regressions, diagnostics), and synthesized results with behavioral and microstructure evidence. Coverage is detailed and multi‑faceted (statistical results, visual CARs, attention and arbitrage constraints), meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, detailed event‑study implementation (estimation window, expected-return models, AR/CAR calculation, t‑tests) and reports specific numerical results and diagnostics, plus robustness checks (multi‑factor, sentiment, borrow fees). They also discuss limitations (power, volatility) and interpret results, meeting the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tests how quickly and accurately information is reflected using appropriate event‑study methods, reports numeric AR/CAR and t‑test results, and interprets both supporting (Cohen, congressional) and violating (short squeeze) cases. They also address limitations (power, volatility) and add robustness (multi‑factor, sentiment, borrow fees), providing a thorough, well‑reasoned treatment of information incorporation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal‑return calculations and reports concrete numerical outputs (alphas, betas, AR/CAR, t‑values), demonstrating execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code execution statements, block‑by‑block descriptions, or ownership-level detail of implementation, so the evidence supports a partial rather than full pass.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates active validation steps (fact checking baseline prices and running robustness checks with multi‑factor, sentiment, and borrow‑fee data), showing external‑oriented verification effort. However, they do not name specific external sources/tools used for cross‑checking (e.g., data providers or websites), so the validation is concrete but not externally referenced, yielding a partial score.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tanmayi —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve shifted from “reactive” thinking to a systematic, DRIVER-style approach. Your work shows a clear command of core financial concepts (you explain valuation drivers, cash flow mechanics, and risk premia with precision), and you’ve already begun to tie those concepts to technology thoughtfully — for example, your use of structured inputs to separate assumptions from outputs made your scenario comparisons transparent. Your solutions consistently follow a logical flow: define the decision, identify relevant drivers, and show how results change when assumptions change. That evidences real progress in turning a busy mind into a disciplined analyst.\n\nFor the next leg of development, treat technical implementation as the bridge between insight and business impact. Practical next steps:\n- Build one compact financial model (e.g., a 3-statement forecast or DCF) with clear assumption cells, labeled checks, and a short “how to read this” note. That makes your thinking reproducible for managers.\n- Add simple guardrails: sanity checks (ratios or percentage bounds), an input validation checklist, and a scenario table that maps to business decisions (hire vs. freeze, invest vs. divest).\n- Practice translating model outputs into decisions: write two short memos that tie model scenarios to action (e.g., “If IRR < X, postpone capex; if revenue growth > Y, expand production”), so your technical work directly informs FP&A or investment choices.\n\nKeep in mind this is cumulative—each disciplined model and each decision memo compounds your credibility. Your systematic thinking is precisely the skill that finance leaders prize: it reduces ambiguity, speeds decisions, and scales across teams. Stay curious, keep iterating on small, business-focused implementations, and you’ll find the DRIVER habits pay off in real strategic influence. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
