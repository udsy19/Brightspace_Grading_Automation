  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes and applies all three EMH forms (weak, semi‑strong, strong) to the GME case, cites concrete evidence (momentum, 140% short interest), and executed data verification/code to support claims. The discussion is conceptually thorough with specific examples and a clear DRIVER workflow, meeting the PASS threshold.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the research question (test EMH using GME), lists hypotheses (weak/semi‑strong/strong forms), and presents a concrete stepwise research design (data verification, planned tests, comparative and behavioral analyses). These explicit statements satisfy the Define & Discover requirement under the DRIVER framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, organized workflow—defining tests, importing data/code, performing data validation and visual analyses, and planning normal‑return/CAPM calculations—showing systematic implementation of an event‑study approach. While some technical specifics (event/estimation windows, AR/CAR reporting) are not detailed, the methodological execution is explicit and structured, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows intent and partial implementation (data import, mention of normal returns and CAPM) consistent with an event‑study approach, but fails to describe or demonstrate key event‑study elements—abnormal return calculation, event/estimation windows, model specification, or reported AR/CAR results. This indicates correct conceptual direction but incomplete methodological detail, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses information incorporation conceptually (identifying a semi‑strong violation and citing 140% short interest) and shows intent to analyze with data and models. However, they do not present quantitative timing or accuracy measures (no event windows, abnormal return calculations, or reported AR/CAR results), so the treatment is incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several key biases (herding, overconfidence/confirmation bias, prospect theory/loss aversion) with contextual examples (diamond hands, short‑squeeze buybacks), showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief and two listed biases (anchoring, mental accounting) are not addressed, so the coverage is incomplete and warrants PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Lucas — I want to celebrate how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to a dependable, repeatable approach. You consistently decomposed cash-flow questions into DRIVER’s building blocks, produced clear scenario comparisons, and tied model outputs back to the business logic (for example: isolating working-capital drivers and showing how each scenario altered operating cash). Those concrete moves — labeling assumptions, tracing mechanics, and verbalizing the “why” behind results — are exactly what I mean by systematic thinking.\n\nFor next steps, treat the one remaining technical gap as an opportunity to make your finance work fit business decision-making more tightly. Practical actions:\n- Create a reconciliation checklist that maps model results to P&L, balance sheet, and cash-flow line-by-line so numbers are auditable by a finance partner.\n- Add sensitivity tables (choose 3–4 high-impact drivers) and a small stress test that shows downside thresholds for covenant risk or runway — this turns analysis into a decision tool for CFOs or investors.\n- Formalize assumptions in an “assumptions pack” with sources and ranges so non-technical stakeholders can validate them quickly.\n\nThese steps aren’t about writing perfect code — they’re about making your models trustworthy in real business contexts: forecasts that survive board scrutiny, budgets that guide operational trade-offs, and investment cases that highlight true risk/reward.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a practice, not a one-time trick. The way you now structure problems will separate you in finance roles: you’ll be the person who reduces ambiguity and enables faster, safer decisions. I’m excited to see how you tighten the last mile — keep iterating, ask for stakeholder feedback early, and keep translating model logic into business implications.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
