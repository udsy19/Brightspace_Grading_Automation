  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (GME short squeeze vs. EMH) and states concrete objectives and planned analyses, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. Evidence shows a defined scope and procedural plan rather than implied intent.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan describing what will be done, the sequence of tasks, and the specific analyses to perform, meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is actionable and specific enough that a reviewer or supervisor could understand and evaluate the intended methodology.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documents a clear plan and reports systematic execution (code, data import, normal returns/CAPM calculations and validation of price data), satisfying the moderate Implement requirement for methodological execution. While detailed code outputs are not shown, the workflow and follow-through are explicit and consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the three EMH forms to the GME case and gives specific supporting examples (momentum, 140% short interest), showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is not fully thorough and contains conceptual imprecision (e.g., conflating retail awareness with semi-strong market incorporation), so it demonstrates a correct but incomplete grasp rather than the comprehensive, detailed treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates awareness of event-study components (data, models, normal returns/CAPM) and shows a DRIVER workflow (discover, implement, reflect), but the submission lacks a thorough event-study presentation (no explicit estimation/event windows, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or significance testing). That yields a correct but incomplete treatment consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses information incorporation conceptually and cites specific public signals (e.g., 140% short interest) and data checks, showing understanding. However, they do not provide a rigorous timeline, quantitative measures, or tests of how quickly/accurately prices reacted to discrete news events, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, consistent with PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Lucas — I’m really pleased with how your thinking has shifted this term. You’ve moved from ad-hoc problem solving to deliberately walking through DRIVER steps: your Define and Investigate notes clearly isolate the business question and relevant drivers, and your explanations of the finance concepts increasingly tie to real-world measures (cash flow timing, margin sensitivity, and capital efficiency). Your write-ups are clearer and more persuasive — I can see you’re learning to translate numbers into managerial decisions.\n\nNext steps to accelerate that progress. First, tighten the technical execution of your analyses so outputs are robust for business use: explicitly state assumptions up front, add simple sanity checks (e.g., verifying that projected cash flows reconcile to balance-sheet items or that margin expansions are feasible against historical variance), and run a few stress scenarios to expose brittle results. These are practical habits used in FP&A and investor pitches to avoid surprises. Second, strengthen a couple DRIVER components you’ve begun to adopt but haven’t fully closed — especially the “Verify” stage. After you produce a result, create a short verification checklist (assumption plausibility, sensitivity to key drivers, and alternative hypotheses) and log any discrepancies; this will make your recommendations defensible to stakeholders.\n\nKeep pushing this way. Systematic thinking — defining the decision, isolating drivers, testing assumptions — is what separates competent analysts from strategic finance leaders. Treat every assignment as a miniature business case: the process matters as much as the output. I’m excited to see how you apply these habits to bigger, messier problems next semester. You’re on a steady trajectory; stay curious and keep iterating."
