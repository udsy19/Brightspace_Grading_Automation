  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives a correct, clear definition of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and directly applies those concepts via an event-study simulation focused on earnings announcements (semi-strong form). The submission includes concrete parameters, measurable metrics (AR, CAR, Efficiency Ratio), and interpretation linking observed post-event drift to behavioral under-reaction, demonstrating thorough and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes event-study methodology (use of CAPM for expected returns) and gives explicit AR and CAR definitions, plus concrete simulation parameters and interpretations linking results to efficiency testing. The submission shows applied understanding across DRIVER stages (Define/Implement/Visualize/Reflect), with enough detail and examples to meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines the information-incorporation question, implements a proper event-study approach (CAPM-based expected returns, AR/CAR), and uses concrete parameters and an efficiency ratio to quantify how much of the reaction occurs on Day 0. The DRIVER stages show both methodological rigor and interpreted results tying observed post-event drift to slower incorporation, providing a thorough, applied treatment that meets PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names major behavioral biases and applies behavioral thinking to the event-study (post-earnings drift) using a simulated example, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief—biases are listed but not explained or individually illustrated in depth (mental accounting missing), so the coverage is correct but not comprehensive, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and demonstrates momentum/post-earnings drift with concrete simulation parameters and interpretation, meeting part of the anomalies criterion. However, discussion of other canonical anomalies (value effect, size effect, calendar anomalies) is absent, so coverage is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes the CAPM-based approach and the AR/CAR calculations and provides concrete simulation inputs, showing partial technical implementation. However, they do not demonstrate explicit personal execution (no block-by-block code explanation, no explicit \"I ran and verified\" or CAPM formula/implementation details), so the strict technical standard is not fully met.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alejandro — I want to start by calling out how clearly you’ve moved from ad hoc intuition to a DRIVER-style, systematic thinker. Your work showed concrete strengths: you consistently tied model drivers (revenue growth, margins, working capital) back to business levers, and you built repeatable logic flows that made the valuation and forecast steps traceable. That ability to map financial outcomes to operational inputs — and to keep the chain of cause → effect visible — is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nNow, next steps to turn that progress into real-world impact. For technical implementation, you’re making headway but can sharpen reproducibility and validation. Practical moves: modularize your models so each block (revenue, COGS, capex, WC) can be run and audited independently; add simple validation checks (e.g., balance sheet reconciliations, cash-flow sign checks) and a short “assumption sheet” that peers can review. Business payoff: models that are auditable and modular get accepted faster by FP&A teams, investors, and acquirers.\n\nFor communication, focus on distilling the story for decision makers. Convert your full analysis into a one-page executive summary that highlights the top 3 sensitivities, a best/worst/base scenario, and the single most important operational lever. Complement this with one chart that shows how a change in that lever moves NPV or free cash flow. That makes your analytical rigor actionable for a CFO or board.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is a career multiplier. The habit of tracing outcomes to drivers will make you invaluable in FP&A, corporate strategy, and investor conversations. This journey is ongoing; each model you tighten and each story you sharpen compounds. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
