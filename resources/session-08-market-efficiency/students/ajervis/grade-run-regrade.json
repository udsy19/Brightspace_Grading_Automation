  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives accurate, explicit definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, cites a concrete empirical phenomenon (post-earnings announcement drift) that challenges semi-strong efficiency, and implements a simulation (efficiency ratio, AR/CAR) that applies those concepts. Coverage is both conceptual and applied, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes event-study methodology (CAPM-based expected returns), defines abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, implements these in a simulation with concrete parameters, and interprets results (efficiency ratio, post-event drift). The DRIVER stages show both conceptual understanding and practical application, meeting the threshold for a thorough, applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines a clear, measurable metric for information incorporation (Efficiency Ratio), implements a CAPM-based event study with concrete parameters, and interprets simulated AR/CAR dynamics to assess how quickly and accurately the market reflects new information. DRIVER stages show both conceptual framing and practical application, supporting a thorough treatment of the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission clearly defines and attempts abnormal-return calculations (AR = actual − expected, CAR as running sum) and describes implementation steps and outputs. However, it lacks strict explicit technical evidence required here (no block-by-block code explanation, no clear statement of personally running and verifying the code), so it meets the criterion partially but not fully.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student acknowledges validation practices (comparing to actual market data) and uses reproducibility checks (random seed), showing awareness of validation. However, no specific external sources, tools, or explicit comparisons/results are named, so validation is general rather than concrete, yielding a partial score.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alejandro — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to deliberate, repeatable thinking. Your work shows crisp command of core finance ideas: your cash-flow logic, valuation assumptions, and treatment of risk all hang together in a way that communicates you understand the economically important drivers. I also appreciate how you used technology and AI as an execution partner — extracting data, checking calculations, and keeping your analysis traceable — and how you consistently mapped your work to the DRIVER steps so your decisions are transparent and defendable.\n\nFor the next stage, focus on strengthening the technical implementation layer so your solid logic converts reliably into business-ready outputs. Practical next steps:\n- Build a minimal, reproducible model of one analysis you care about (e.g., a 3‑scenario DCF or a sensitivity matrix for working capital). Keep the logic explicit: inputs, formulas, and outputs separate so a stakeholder can validate assumptions quickly.\n- Translate key decision rules into checklists or simple decision tables (what triggers upward/downward revision of a forecast? what covariates drive credit stress?), then test those rules with a couple of real company examples.\n- Practice packaging findings for a business audience: one-slide executive takeaway, one-page assumptions appendix, and a short appendix with stress-test results. That structure makes your systematic thinking usable in finance roles like FP&A, corporate development, or credit.\n\nYou’re building a powerful habit: turning fuzzy questions into disciplined, testable answers. That habit is what elevates you in real-world finance — it’s not a destination but the core of a career that creates value. Keep iterating; I’m excited to see your next, tighter cycle of analysis. If you want, bring one model and we’ll walk through simplifying it together."
