  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the research question, scope, use of the DRIVER framework, and a concrete verification step and timeline—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover research design. This provides a clear, defensible problem definition and initial research plan.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly planned and executed external validation by checking the disputed price claim against Yahoo Finance and documenting corrected figures, satisfying the Validate requirement for external validation. Although no formal statistical tests are shown, the rubric allows external source comparison as sufficient for PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly links theoretical EMH distinctions to observed behavioral phenomena and states a clear synthesis (temporary inefficiencies caused by collective psychology, with long‑run correction supporting EMH). This direct integration of theory and observed behavior satisfies the strict Reflect requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes weak, semi‑strong, and strong forms and links them to event evidence (abnormal returns, volume, behavioral drivers), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is brief and lacks depth, quantitative support, and deeper theoretical discussion required for a thorough (PASS) evaluation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal returns and frames an event‑study investigation using the DRIVER framework, showing conceptual awareness. However, they do not present an event‑study methodology (estimation window, model for expected returns, AR/CAR calculations, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes that public information and social-media signals affected price (semi‑strong implications) and cites abnormal returns and correction, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they do not analyze timing or provide quantitative measures (event windows, arrival times, speed/statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Caleb — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve shifted from ad-hoc problem solving to a DRIVER-oriented mindset. Your work shows concrete strengths: you consistently define the financial question up front, break problems into logical substeps, and justify model choices with finance-first reasoning (e.g., explicit assumptions around cash flows and discounting). That systematic structuring — laying out objectives, inputs, and desired outputs before you build anything — is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nFor next steps, treat the remaining gaps as opportunities to make your models business-ready. On the technical front, focus on validation and scenario testing: deliberately build and document a handful of edge cases (stress scenarios, extreme growth/decline) and show how outputs change. In practical finance terms, that looks like sensitivity tables for forecast drivers, a short memo on model limitations for stakeholders, and a simple reconciliation of model output to an accounting baseline. For integration of finance and tech, prioritize traceable assumptions and outputs — make each financial metric map back to a named input and a one-sentence interpretation a CFO could act on. Regarding DRIVER adherence, add a brief “verify & reflect” step after each deliverable: what surprised you, which assumptions matter most, and what would you change next quarter.\n\nKeep thinking of this as an iterative craft. The ability to translate messy business questions into repeatable, defensible analyses will set you apart in real-world finance roles. You’re on a clear trajectory — sustain the habit of documenting decisions and testing extremes, and you’ll convert strong analysis into reliable, high-impact recommendations. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
