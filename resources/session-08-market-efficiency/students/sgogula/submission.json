  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Manisa and today my task was to analyze the GameStop short squeeze event which covers a period from 2020 and onwards and my analysis includes the his verifying the historical GME stock data visualizing price and volume trends with key event annotations and then discussing short speech dynamics with provided data points and evaluating weak form and semi-strong form market efficiency and then discussing them and then assessing systematic profitability for ratio rational investors and then exploring behavioral finance explanations for observed anomalies and then I'll conclude with a comprehensive summary addressing all aspects of the analysis. So here I am fetching the his GME historical data and I'm ensuring that the Y finance library is installed and imported which is required for fetching stock data and then I do this. So I fetch the data using f y finance.d download starting from 2020 and store it in a pandas data frame and then I display the first few rows to verify the data structure and the content and the GME data frame currently has multi-level column names which will can be cumbersome for plotting and analysis and flattening these column names to a single more accessible level will simplify future operations. So I verified the 2020 August 2020 price. So first I'll filter the GME data to include only on entries for August 20th and then isolate the relevant time period for price verification. Now that the data for 2020 is filtered, I will extract the relevant price columns and then calculate and print the minimum and maximum values for these prices to verify the statement about GME's trading price. And here are the minimum and maximum values. So now I'm going to visualize GME price and the volume trends. So I created the plot showing GME historical stock price and trading volume over the relevant period and then I marked and annotated key events from the provided timeline and then so basically here's the reasoning for my code. I need to generate a plot that visualizes GME historical stock price and trading volumes along with annotations for key events. And this will involve plotting libraries, creating subplots, plotting the data, adding event markers and label labels, and ensuring that the plot is well formatted and readable. And here's the GME stock price and all new trends with key event annotations. So then I analyzed the uh short squeeze dynamics and basically uh the trading volume clearly illustrates the extraordinary events that unfolded particularly in January and February and the short squeeze feedback loop. As the price began to climb due to retail buying, the short sellers faced increasing marginal margin calls and mounting losses. And to mitigate these, they were forced to cover their short positions, which involves buying back shares they had borrowed and sold. And the short covering created a very powerful feedback loop of increased buying, further price increase, and then more pressure on shorts. And this vicious psycho is evident in the plot as the blue line skyrockets upward in late 2021 and the trading volume simultaneously explodes to unprecedented levels. The events of this February to 21 uh fee January to February 21 demonstrate how a highly shorted stock combined with the coordinated influx of buying pressure can lead to a parabolic price movement as short sellers are forced to liquidate their positions. And then I evaluated big form efficiency. So to analyze GM's past movements, past uh price movements and assess weak form market efficiency, the first step is to calculate the daily logarithmic returns of the GM closing price and these are preferred for financial time series analysis as they're addictive over time and better reflect continuous compounding and then the daily logarith uh logarithmic returns have been calculated. I will compute the um autocorrelation function ACF of these returns and plot it to visualize the correlation of returns with their past values and this will identify any discernable patterns or can indicate a violation of weak for market form efficiency and here's that graph. So the ACF plot shows that it's basically a crucial tool for assessing weak form market efficiency and based on this plot the daily returns appear to be independent and randomly distributed. The lack of significant autocorrelations across most Slack suggests that the past price movements cannot re reliably predict future price movements for GME. Therefore, the analysis of daily returns through the ACF plot generally supports a notion of weak for market efficiency for GME. This implies that technical analysis which relies on historical price patterns to forecast future prices would not likely not be consistently profitable in this market after accounting for trading costs. And then I evaluated semi-strong form efficiency. So I compared the observed past behavior during the short squeeze especially the surge to 483 against publicly available information such as analyst fundamental value estimates which is 10 to 40 per share and then I assess whether new public information was immediately or full and fully reflected in the stock price and from that analysis I got that the GM short squeeze event particularly search to um 483 against the estimates of 10 to 40 represents a clear violation of semi strong form market effic efficiency and And the reason for the violation is that the semi-strong market uh semi-rong form efficiency posits that all publicly available information is already incorporated into the stock price. Meaning that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal returns by analyzing public data. In the case of GME, the price drastically overshot any reasonable fundamental valuation based on publicly available analyst reports and company information. An investor who is acting solely on the publicly known fundamental value of 10 to 40 would have been entirely misled by the market price action and the ability of certain investors to profit immensely from the pure technical and sentimentdriven squeeze independent of fundamental public information contradicts the core tenet of semi-strong form efficiency. So while the market is eventually corrected the period of extreme mediation indicates that the publicly available information was not the primary driver of price and was certainly not immediately and fully reflected. So next I evaluated the strong form efficiency where I discussed strong form market efficiency in the context of GME considering whether any participants would have systematically profited using private non-public information and acknowledge the difficulty of empirical testing without access to insider data. So it is important to emphasize that primary driver primary drivers of GMA squeeze were public information and specific market mechanics and the question of whether any informations exploited truly non-public information for systematic gain remains largely answerable for an external datadriven analysis while suspicions of insider training may arise during such unusual market fence proving them require access to internal private data that's behind beyond the scope of the analysis that I'm doing and then I assess test the systematic profitability for rational investors and I concluded that systematic profit profitability was not feasible. The extraordinary market dynamics driven by the unprecedented combination of short interest social media coordination and herd behavior let it price movements from fundamental value and traditional market indicators. The event highlights that the limitations of traditional market efficiency assumptions in the face of external extreme behavioral anomalies and collective action. And then I explored the behavioral finance explanations. And I concluded that the GME shorts cannot be adequately explained by rational assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis. And instead it reveals like a complex interplay of human psychology that led to an an anomalous price surge and a significant albeit temporary deviation from fundamental valuations. And then I concluded also that the GM short space cannot be explained by rational assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis. And then for I finally summarized everything and I basically the insight that I received is that the GME short squeeze serves as a pivotal case study in illustrating how extreme behavior phenomena and market micro structure can override traditional financial theories and fundamental valuations leading to significant market anomalies. And future research could investigate the long-term impact of social mediadriven collective action on market stability and explore potential regulatory frameworks to address such events, balancing marketing freedom with investor protection.
