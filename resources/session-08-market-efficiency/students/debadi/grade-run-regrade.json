  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both described and executed appropriate empirical tests (event study, predictability tests, volume analysis) tied to each EMH form and provided interpreted conclusions and mechanisms. The combination of planned tests, implemented methods, and reflective conclusions shows a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specified and implemented a standard CAPM event‑study workflow (model choice, 250‑day estimation window, 30‑day gap, AR/CAR calculation), applied it to multiple events, and used diagnostics (t‑stats, Ljung‑Box/OS, volume) to interpret results. That combination of clear methodology, application, and interpretation demonstrates a thorough, competent treatment of event‑study and abnormal‑return calculation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specified and applied a standard event‑study methodology across multiple events (estimation window, CAPM, AR/CAR, diagnostics) and used those results to judge speed and accuracy of information incorporation, concluding semi‑strong efficiency largely holds. The combination of planned tests, implemented analysis, and interpreted outcomes shows a thorough, applied treatment consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly outlined and described the abnormal‑return methodology, functions, and reported outputs, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT standard they did not explicitly state personal execution/verification (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\") nor give block‑by‑block ownership or detailed code walkthrough, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal checks (summary statistics, Ljung‑Box p‑values) and stated a verification step, showing some validation effort. However they did not cite or compare results to specific external sources/tools, so validation is present but not external/specified, yielding PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Daran —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted through the DRIVER framework. You consistently translate finance concepts into precise models: your cash-flow logic, risk-return linkages, and capital-allocation rationale were consistently accurate and well explained. I also appreciate how you connected finance and technology — choosing tools to automate repetitive checks and to surface anomalies shows you’re thinking like someone who wants decisions to be defensible, not just convenient. The way you followed DRIVER’s steps (Define, Research, Identify, Verify, Execute, Review) in your assignments demonstrates a real move from “monkey mind” intuition to systematic process.\n\nNext steps to accelerate: focus on closing the technical-implementation gap as a business enabler, not an end in itself. Practically, pick one end-to-end finance decision — such as a three-year investment case or working-capital optimization — and build a compact, auditable worksheet or script that:\n- Encodes core assumptions in a single “Inputs” block,\n- Produces sensitivity tables and a scenario dashboard (best/worst/base),\n- Includes simple automated validation checks (e.g., balance sheet identities, non-negative cash),\n- And a short README that explains how a business stakeholder should use it.\n\nThese moves will turn your solid financial logic into tools that business leaders can trust under time pressure.\n\nKeep treating AI as an execution assistant: have it generate templates, but own the guardrails and the interpretation. Your systematic habits are already a career multiplier — they make you faster, less error-prone, and more persuasive. This is a long, rewarding journey; you’re clearly on the right path. I’m excited to see your next iteration. — Prof. Zhang"
