  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the three EMH forms, implemented appropriate empirical tests (event-study with CAPM, serial-correlation tests, volume analysis) on multiple events, and provided specific conclusions for each form while discussing frictions and behavioral explanations. This is a thorough, applied treatment that meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specifies and implements a standard event-study procedure (CAPM expected returns, 250-day estimation window, AR/CAR computation), runs it across multiple events, and applies statistical tests for inference, then interprets results. This applied, multi-event, methodologically explicit treatment meets the PASS threshold for thoroughness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied standard, multi-event event-study methods (CAPM-based AR/CAR, statistical tests, volume analysis), produced event-level evidence, and explicitly concluded on the speed and accuracy of information incorporation (semi-strong holding with transient overshoots). This explicit methodology, multiple events, statistical inference, and interpretation meet the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and links some behavioral biases (overconfidence, lottery preferences, attention/herding-like cascades) to observed patterns and uses empirical tests as support, but they omit or do not discuss anchoring, loss aversion, and mental accounting and provide limited depth on mechanisms. This is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performed event-study and short-lag predictability tests but never examined momentum, value, size, or calendar effects explicitly. Because the required anomaly classes were not analyzed or demonstrated, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission shows correct methodology for CAPM‑based abnormal return calculation (estimation window, model outputs, statistical tests) and interprets results, so technical approach is present. However the student did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block‑by‑block code explanations/ownership required by the STRICT technical standard, so the work is only partially meeting the criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Daran —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset: you’re already thinking like a finance professional who uses technology to enforce rigorous logic rather than replace it. You did a strong job tying financial models to automation—your approach to structuring cash-flow logic, separating assumptions from formulas, and using AI as an assistant to generate alternative scenarios shows real systems thinking. I also noticed you consistently followed the DRIVER steps in your workflows: scoping the problem, defining explicit rules, and documenting assumptions so a reviewer can follow your reasoning. That shift from “tweak until it works” to “design so it’s auditable” is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nNext steps to accelerate impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Sharpen a core financial concept: revisit the timing of free cash flows and working-capital adjustments. In practice, small timing errors change NPV and can sway real capital-allocation decisions (e.g., buy vs. build). Walk through one model line-by-line against the underlying accounting entries until the flows reconcile.\n- Strengthen model validation for business use: build a simple checklist of sanity checks (year-over-year growth limits, sign checks, terminal-growth plausibility) and run sensitivity analyses that CFOs expect for investment decisions or M&A bids.\n- Turn your DRIVER documentation into decision evidence: add a one-page executive summary that maps key assumptions to business levers (price, volume, capex) so stakeholders can see how assumptions feed valuation outcomes.\n\nYou’re on a career path where systematic thinking pays off exponentially. Treat this as an ongoing craft: every model you make is practice for higher-stakes decisions. Keep iterating—your ability to translate business intuition into disciplined, auditable models will distinguish you in finance leadership. I’m excited to see where you take this next. —Prof. Zhang"
