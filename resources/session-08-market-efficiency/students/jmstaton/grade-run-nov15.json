This is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses a valuation gap and offers qualitative explanations but provides no discussion of event-study methodology, estimation windows, expected return models, abnormal return calculation, or statistical testing. Given the absence of any event-study procedure or abnormal-return analysis in the Discover/Implement/Reflect stages, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a basic conceptual grasp that markets may not immediately or accurately reflect fundamentals (noting mispricing and behavioral drivers), but they do not explicitly address the speed, mechanisms, or measures of information incorporation (e.g., reaction times, adjustment process, or empirical tests).

  "personalized_feedback": "Jacob — I’ve seen a real shift in how you approach problems this term, and that transformation is exactly what DRIVER is meant to produce. You’ve moved from ad-hoc number-crunching to laying out clear financial questions before you build — for example, your recent project explicitly stated cash-flow drivers and attempted sensitivity checks. That habit of naming the business decision first and then mapping the finance logic is a concrete strength: it shows you’re developing systematic thinking rather than relying on intuition alone. I also appreciate how you used AI to run repetitive scenarios and kept a running rationale for assumptions — that shows good judgment about when automation helps versus when you need to reason.\n\nNext steps (practical, business-focused):\n- Tighten assumption discipline: for the two financial-concept areas that still need work, add a one-page assumptions table tied to observable business metrics (sales per customer, churn rate, AR days). Make each assumption traceable to data or a stakeholder interview.\n- Improve validation and integration: for the technical/ integration gaps, run three scenario analyses (base / downside / upside) and produce a short P&L-to-cashflow reconciliation that highlights how each driver flows through to cash — this is what decision-makers care about.\n- Communicate decisions succinctly: draft a two-slide decision brief (key takeaways + sensitivity table) for any model you hand off. That will sharpen your ability to explain trade-offs to non-technical leaders.\n- Use DRIVER as a checklist: Define assumptions, Iterate models, Validate results, Execute scenarios, Report outcomes.\n\nKeep treating analysis as a business conversation, not just a computational exercise. The systematic habits you’re building — disciplined assumptions, traceable logic, scenario thinking — will make you a more trusted finance partner in any organization. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
