  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and today this is the session 8 video assignment. So here in this scenario, it says that we've spent weeks analyzing GameStop using every technique from sessions one through six previously and our CAPM based valuation shows intrinsic value of $12 per share, but the stock is trading at $200 currently. And in our mind, we come up with three explanations for that. First one is just that we're wrong simply just a user error and that our analysis may have missed something important. Your second option is oh you know maybe the market is wrong and that the fundamental analysis reveals there was some sort of mispricing. And your third explanation is just, you know, markets are weird, prices reflect psychology as much as fundamentals at this point. So, which one of these seems to be the most accurate? So for the specific case of this GameStop um scenario, the most accurate explanation in my opinion would be a combination of the second explanation as well as the third. And since the the price was pretty clearly like a bubble, which is kind of what explanation 2 is about, um, it has like some unique behavioral biases and it also has some like market dynamics with those biases, which is basically what the third explanation is trying to get at. So, I don't think this one is correct. Um, it just it's completely overridden by like the market mechanics and psychology thing. So, I personally believe it is a mix of these two right here.",
