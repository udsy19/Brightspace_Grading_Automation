  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student went beyond computing metrics by comparing parametric vs historical VaR and ES, diagnosing heavy left tails, identifying COVID as the dominant stress event, running targeted scenario tests that quantify portfolio sensitivity, and deriving concrete risk-management actions (limits, stop-losses, concentration controls). These analyses and recommendations demonstrate thorough, data-driven interpretation and practical integration of results.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, stepwise methodology: data acquisition and preprocessing, return construction, multiple quantitative risk measures (historical/parametric VaR, ES), visualization, and targeted event/window analysis (worst‑day list and COVID window). Although not a full formal AR/CAR estimation, the implemented sequence and multiple outputs demonstrate systematic event‑focused execution consistent with the DRIVER Implement expectations.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student connects diagnostic results (parametric VaR underestimation, heavy left tail, COVID as dominant stress event) to specific investment actions (daily VaR limits, stop‑loss/degrossing, concentration limits, multi‑metric monitoring). These are explicit, actionable strategy changes directly derived from the analysis, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains detailed risk-measure discussion but no mention or analysis of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (weak, semi-strong, strong forms). Because the required concept is missing entirely, the student fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains extensive VaR/ES/stress‑test analysis but no discussion or application of event‑study methodology or abnormal‑return computation (e.g., estimation/event windows, market models, CAR/AR, t‑tests). Because the required concept is missing, the student fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript focuses on risk metrics and stress events but contains no discussion or application of information‑incorporation measures (e.g., event study methodology, abnormal returns, estimation/event windows, or significance testing). Because the required concept is missing, the student fails this criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Abbey — I’ve watched your thinking become noticeably more disciplined this term, and that shift is the real achievement. You consistently framed problems clearly (stating the decision to be made and the constraints), decomposed complex valuation tasks into orderly steps, and documented your assumptions so a reviewer can follow your logic. Those are hallmark DRIVER habits: you’re turning scattered “what-if” instincts into reproducible finance workflows.\n\nNext steps to convert that structure into rock‑solid financial answers: focus on a few targeted concept improvements and apply them directly to business cases. In practice I’d recommend:\n- Revisit core valuation mechanics (discount rates, timing of cash flows, terminal value drivers). Take one past assignment and re-run the numbers, tracking where changes in assumptions move the outcome — this ties the math to business intuition.\n- Reconcile accounting items with free cash flow generation (ensure working capital, capex, and non‑cash items are treated correctly). Try this on a one‑year-to-full-cycle projection for a real company.\n- Add systematic sensitivity checks: build a simple table that varies revenue growth, margin, and WACC to show decision thresholds for stakeholders.\n- Close the DRIVER gaps with a checklist: define objective, list assumptions, implement model, validate outputs, explain implications. Use peer review once before submission.\n\nKeep pushing this iterative habit—every rework converts ambiguity into decisions you can defend. Systematic thinking is the career multiplier in finance: it lets you move from plausible stories to persuasive, repeatable recommendations. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
