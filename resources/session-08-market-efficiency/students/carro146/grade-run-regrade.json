  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, organized workflow (setup, data download, returns, portfolio, multiple risk metrics, visualizations, stress and scenario tests) and produces multiple outputs consistent with a methodical implementation. This systematic execution meets the Implement criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, staged workflow (setup → data → transform → analysis → validation) and produces multiple, consistent outputs (VaR variants, ES, plots, stress/scenario tests), demonstrating systematic execution of Python analysis. This satisfies the Implement criterion under the moderate DRIVER standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly articulated VaR limitations and provided concrete, actionable recommendations and broader system goals (risk limits, governance, stop-loss rules), demonstrating thoughtful reflection beyond code execution. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of the Efficient Market Hypothesis or its weak, semi-strong, and strong forms. All quoted material and DRIVER stages center on risk metrics (VaR, ES, stress tests) and their limits, so the EMH criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses entirely on risk measurement (VaR/ES/stress tests) and dataset setup but contains no discussion of event-study design, event windows, market-model or benchmark selection, abnormal return calculation, or statistical inference for event studies. Therefore the criterion for Market Efficiency Testing is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript focuses exclusively on risk measurement and stress scenarios with no discussion of the speed or accuracy of price reactions, event windows, abnormal-return computation, or testing market response to news. Therefore the Information Incorporation criterion is not demonstrated.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Abbey — I want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from scattershot attempts to a much more methodical approach. In your recent work I noticed you consistently broke big finance questions into smaller, testable parts and used a sequence of checks before drawing conclusions — that’s the heart of DRIVER thinking. You also showed curiosity about how assumptions drive outputs (asking “what if” about key inputs), and you brought real business context into your examples, which makes your models useful beyond the classroom.\n\nFor the next steps, let’s convert the remaining gaps into a focused action plan:\n- Financial-concept gaps: identify the three concepts that tripped you up (e.g., valuation mechanics, risk-adjusted discounting, or cash-flow timing). For each, write a one-paragraph definition, one simple numeric example, and one short note on how errors would change a business decision (M&A, budgeting, or investment approval).\n- Technical & integration gaps: pick one model you already built and add a sensitivity table and a short executive-style sentence that ties each sensitivity to a business action (raise price, delay investment, hedge exposure). That links code outputs to decisions — the core of financial tech.\n- DRIVER discipline: for your next assignment, explicitly label each step using DRIVER: Define the question, Research inputs, Isolate drivers, Validate assumptions, Execute the model, Report the decision. Make the validation step show two sanity checks or external benchmarks.\n\nKeep treating code and AI as execution partners — they free you to focus on assumptions and interpretation. Your growing habit of decomposing problems is exactly the skill finance leaders need. This is a long arc: every rigorously documented assumption and every sensitivity you run sharpens judgment. I’m excited to see how you translate these next steps into clearer, more business-ready analyses."
