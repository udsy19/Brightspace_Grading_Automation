  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, applied understanding of the three EMH forms, defines them clearly, and uses multiple concrete tests and real-world examples (simulation, AR spikes, volume, short-seller failures) to argue which forms were violated. Coverage is comprehensive and connects theory to the GME case, satisfying the threshold for PASS under the moderate conceptual standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines abnormal returns, implements an event-style test (simulation, baseline normal return, AR plots), and validates/defends model choices including limitations and alternatives. While not a fully formal econometric event study (no formal significance testing), the treatment is thorough and applied, meeting the moderate-category standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly addresses how quickly and accurately markets incorporated information, argues semi-strong form failure with concrete examples (public valuations vs. $483 price), implements abnormal-return tests and plots to demonstrate timing and magnitude, and validates findings against real events and model alternatives. This applied, multi-stage treatment meets the moderate standard for a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly performed validation steps (data correction, running the code, and comparing simulation results to real-world events). However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., finance APIs, data providers, or named references), which the rubric requires for a full PASS; therefore the evidence supports a PARTIAL score.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jacob — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to clear, repeatable reasoning. You consistently apply core finance concepts correctly (your cash-flow logic and linkage to valuation was spot-on), you integrated technological tools to enforce that logic rather than replace it, and your explanations made the chain of reasoning easy to follow. Those are concrete signs your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker: you now build models as disciplined decision tools, not just calculation machines.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on tightening the decision layer and the validation loop. In practice that means:\n- Convert key assumptions into explicit decision levers (e.g., growth rate, discount rate, working-capital days) and present business-impact metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) tied to stakeholder questions.  \n- Run structured sensitivity and scenario analyses that map to real business choices (pricing changes, capex timing, funding mix). Make a short one-page “what-to-watch” dashboard that shows which inputs move decisions most.  \n- Add a lightweight validation step: compare model outputs to simple heuristic checks (back-of-envelope, historical ranges) and document any discrepancies and why they’re acceptable.\n\nThese are small habits that lift your work from correct to decisively useful for managers.\n\nKeep treating code and AI as execution helpers and let the DRIVER framework shape your questions. Over time, that discipline will make you the person leaders rely on to turn uncertain finance problems into clear, actionable choices. I’m excited to see where you take this — you’re on a career path where systematic thinking becomes a distinctive advantage."
