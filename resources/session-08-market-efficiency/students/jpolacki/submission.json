  "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Jacob Polackin, and this is my analysis of the GameStop short squeeze, as shown in Session 8. This assignment is going to go through the full investigation of the event using the DRIVER framework and testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis against behavioral finance concepts. This analysis is going to show the DRIVER process. I'll walk you through each one of the steps, and I will show you how I built the analysis with the code that I wrote. My process began with stage one of the DRIVER process: Define & Discover. This is where I defined the problem and gathered the facts. The most critical first step was to verify the historical data. The assignment prompt asked us to verify the price of 4 cents in August 2020. As you can see in my documentation, I found this was incorrect. The actual split-adjusted price was around four to five dollars. I noted this correction and decided to use the correct low price, as the core story of a massive spike is still valid. Next, I defined the key concepts from Session 8 that I would need. These include the three forms of EMH, behavioral biases (especially herding), and the most important concept for this case: limits to arbitrage. This is the idea that 'market fixers,' or short-sellers, can be stopped from correcting a wrong price. As we look more into the Define & Discover process, the main problem was: was the GME event a total failure? We need to test which, if any, part of the EMH was broken and see if behavioral finance (or mob psychology) explains it better. The EMH forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong. For weak: can you beat the market just by looking at past price charts? Does the price already include all public news, like company reports? And strong: does the price even include private or insider info? It's also looking at information incorporation. Abnormal return, as seen in Session 8, measures a 'surprise' return. We'll use the KISS formula: Abnormal Return = Today's Return - Normal Average Return. This will show us just how not normal the GME squeeze was. Then behavioral bias: we're once again looking for herding—everyone piling into GME just because everyone else was. Overconfidence: small investors believing they were smarter than the big hedge funds. And market anomalies, or momentum. This is when winning stocks keep winning. GME was like momentum on steroids, driven by social media. Limits to arbitrage is the force that should fix mispriced stocks, like short-sellers. A 'limit' is something that stops this from working. The GME short squeeze was the limit. It bankrupted the people trying to fix the price. Then, asset substitution or risk-shifting is relevant to hedge funds. When Melvin Capital was losing billions on GME, they were forced to sell other good stocks to raise cash. This was risk-shifting, which spread the problem to other parts of the market. Using this, we defined the 'D' section, and now we're going to move on to 'R'. For Represent, the objective is to make a clear plan for how we'll analyze the GME event and test the ideas from the 'D' stage. First, we'll be looking at our data plan using the KISS method. We'll follow the spirit of the code that I wrote in the Implement section, and we'll use this to simulate the GME data. This avoids needing complex downloads and stuff like that. Our simulation has three phases: The pre-event: price is low and stable with low trade volume. The event itself: price and volume explode upwards. And post-event: the price crashes and settles at a new level. Our analysis plan: the market efficiency test will plot the simulated price and volume. We expect the charts will show a huge, predictable spike, not a 'random walk' which EMH predicts. Which form was broken? The weak form was broken. While the price chart didn't predict the spike, public social media data (such as Reddit) did. This public pattern could be used to predict the price, so the weak form is broken. Semi-strong, which is clearly violated: all public financial reports said GME (and when I refer to GME, I refer to GameStop) was worth $10 to $40. The price hit $483, proving the market was not using public information rationally. Then strong-form, which is less relevant for this case. It was a public event, not an insider trading scandal. Abnormal return, the AR test. We'll calculate AR using our simple formula from the 'D' stage and plot it. We expect the abnormal return to be tiny or near zero before the event, then show huge positive and negative spikes, proving that the event was abnormal. Then the behavioral test: we'll look at the price and volume charts together. We expect to see a price spike and volume spike happening at the same time, as this is the classic footprint of herding. The fact that the price stayed 'wrong' for so long proves limits to arbitrage were at play. The shorts were getting squeezed. The rational investor test: we'll ask, 'Could a rational investor have made systematic or repeatable money?' What we expect: looking back, of course, it looks easy. Just buy at $5 and sell at $480. But looking forward, it was not something that could have been made with systematic profit. It was pure gambling. They didn't know if $40 was the top, or $100, or $480. The risk of ruin was massive. So, we'll argue the risk-adjusted returns were terrible. Now, as we move on to the Implement section, this is where we're going to take a look at our Python code as well. What our code does: we have a few different functions. The simulate_data function creates the three-phase (pre-event, event, post-event) data for price and volume. run_main_analysis is the main function that checks data, does the different calculations, and plots the three-part chart showing price over time, volume over time, and abnormal returns over time. And then finally, 'printed answers.' After the plot, the code prints a simple text summary that answers the assignment's key questions, such as EMH violations, behavioral factors, and profit potential. So this is the output we got after running our code. The critical first step of data validation: we found that the assignment claim of 4 cents in August 2020 is factually incorrect. (Sorry, I'll try to zoom this out. Yeah, factually incorrect.) It's actually split-adjusted. The price was $4-5. Our simulation starts at $5. So, we proceed using the correct approximated data. The normal return pre-event was 0.3813%. And these are the plots right here. This first chart is assuming the $5 beginning, and then the event happening right here and spiking all the way up to $480. This next plot is our kind of indicator of herding. The volume started very low, and at the time of the event, it spiked and continued spiking while the event was happening, showing a classic scenario of herding and a little bit of visual proof to prove that. And then finally, the bottom chart shows the abnormal returns calculations. We defined it earlier as Today's Return - Normal Average Return. As planned, it's near zero in the pre-event phase and shows massive, chaotic positive and negative spikes, also visually proving how abnormal and volatile the event actually was. And then as we move on, we have some more answers here. First, looking at market efficiency testing. We found that the weak form was violated. Predictable patterns in public social media data (or Reddit) drove the price up, and this technical analysis of price was useless. The semi-strong form was clearly violated. Then finally, we see that for information incorporation, information was not incorporated rationally. Behavioral hype... you can call it... the 'hype' information overwhelmed the fundamental information. Then as we move on, the behavioral finance analysis. The behavioral biases: the explosive volume and price shown in plots one and two are classic signs of herding and overconfidence. The limits to arbitrage: this event is a perfect example. Short-sellers (or rational actors) were bankrupted, such as Melvin Capital, preventing them from correcting the price. Trading halts by Robin Hood were a market rule issue that further limited the arbitrage. Finally, the rational investor profitability analysis. Systematic profit? The answer is no. This was not a systematic or safe and repeatable opportunity. Looking back and looking forward: looking back, profits look easy. But looking forward, it was pure gambling. The risk of buying at the peak was losing 90%. And the abnormal returns shown in plot three show massive volatility and unsafe profit. With the implementation done, we're moving on to the fourth step: Validate. To double-check our findings from the 'I' stage and make sure they make sense, we're going to check our 'abnormal' findings. We found that the 'I' stage plot showed massive, economically significant abnormal returns. We're validating this: it's 100% true. The event really did happen. Our simple simulation captures the character of the event, and the real-world facts confirm it was one of the most abnormal trading periods in history. Then checking our 'gambling' conclusion: we said it was not a systematic profit but rather a gamble. And this is confirmed by reality. For every person who got rich, many others bought the stock at the top—$300 and $400—and lost almost everything. This proves it was not safe or repeatable. Then, checking our limits to arbitrage: we found that the price stayed 'wrong' because the 'market fixers' (or short-sellers) were bankrupted. This is the core truth of the event. The fact that Melvin Capital, a huge hedge fund, lost 53% and needed a bailout is the ultimate proof. Furthermore, Robin Hood stopped trading, which is a perfect example of a market microstructure issue—a problem with the trading platform's rules that acted as a limit. Finally, the robustness check or self-correction. Our simple AR model used an average pre-event return. The PDF shows the CAPM model... (this is the formula for it)... we could have used that, but GME's beta (or riskiness) was changing every minute, and it was not moving with the market. Our simple model, comparing GameStop to itself, is arguably a more honest and simple way to show the deviation. Next, we're going to be moving on to the Evolve section. We're going to use our analysis to explore 'what-if' questions and think about future strategy. So, as we move on to this Evolve section... this is the beginning of my Python code. We're testing a 'what-if' scenario to push the analysis further. The question is: what if social media hype was only 50% as strong? And this Python code here runs that simulation. I'm running the script now. And as we can see... this right here is the result we're getting. The plot shows the evolved analysis. Our blue line is our original event. The orange dashed line is the 50% less-hype scenario. As you can clearly see, the price peak is drastically lower. This test proves that the magnitude of the price bubble was directly tied to the magnitude of the behavioral herding factor, not any change in the company's fundamental value. So yeah, as you can see, this shows that with less hype, the price peak would have been much, much lower. And then the application to investment strategy... what this teaches us: It proves that markets are mostly efficient, but not perfectly efficient. The behavioral factors of herding and market rules (limits to arbitrage) can create pockets of wild inefficiency. A takeaway I had was that trying to exploit these pockets is not investing; it's gambling. For most people, the event confirms that the best strategy is a boring, diversified, passive index fund that avoids this kind of drama. And once again, this is the final conclusion that my test and my Python code gave us. So finally, we get to the Reflect stage. To sum up the whole project and connect it back to the big ideas: EMH versus behavioral finance. The final synthesis: the GME event is a perfect case to show the limits of EMH. EMH predicts a $10 stock should not trade at $483. If it does, short-sellers should jump in, fix the price, and make a profit. And then the GameStop reality: the stock traded at $483. The short-sellers did jump in. They were bankrupted. In conclusion, the simple, rational EMH model cannot explain what happened in the GameStop scenario. The behavioral finance model, which includes herding, overconfidence, and limits to arbitrage, is the only framework that successfully explains what we saw. Next, the theoretical implications: active versus passive. The event does not prove that active stock picking is better than passive index investing. If anything, it shows the opposite. It shows that 'price' and 'value' can stay disconnected for a painfully long time. The main lesson for most investors is to avoid these gambles and stick with passive, diversified plans. The lesson for active short-sellers is that even if you're right with the fundamentals, you can still go broke if you ignore the behavioral side. And finally, policy implications: what should change? The event caused Congress to hold hearings. It forced people to ask big questions, such as: Market rules. Should a company like Robin Hood be allowed to stop people from trading? Gamification. Do trading apps that feel like games encourage this risky herding behavior? And short-selling: how can a stock have 140% of its shares sold short? Is that a failure in the system? This reflection ties together all the financial concepts: EMH, behavioral, limits to arbitrage... and provides a final, clear answer to the assignment. This concludes my DRIVER analysis. I've sequentially walked through all six stages: from Defining the problem and correcting the data, to Representing my plan, Implementing and Validating the code, Evolving the scenario, and Reflecting on the final implications.",
