  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives a clear, comprehensive discussion of weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, proposes and implements specific tests (AR, price/volume plots, simulation), and applies them to the GME case with concrete conclusions. While there is a minor conflation (labeling social-media-driven predictability under \"weak\" rather than semi-strong), the treatment is thorough, uses examples and analyses, and demonstrates strong conceptual grasp overall.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and implements an event-study style abnormal return calculation, simulates pre-event/ event/ post-event data, plots and interprets AR spikes, and discusses model robustness and alternatives. While formal statistical inference (e.g., significance testing or market-model estimation) is not shown, the treatment is thorough and justified for a moderate, concept-focused assignment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tests how quickly and accurately prices reflected information via abnormal-return calculations and simulated event windows, and interprets results against public fundamentals and market events (short-seller losses, trading halts). Although formal statistical inference is limited, the treatment is thorough, uses multiple concrete examples, and provides a justified conclusion that semi-strong information incorporation failed—satisfying the moderate, concept-focused standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies herding and overconfidence with specific plots and a simulation, demonstrating meaningful understanding and application. However, several requested biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly discussed or analyzed, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and analyzes momentum as a central anomaly (with simulation and AR plots) and links it to behavioral causes, showing solid partial mastery. However, other anomaly categories required by the criterion (value effects, size effects, calendar anomalies) are not addressed or analyzed, so the coverage is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student mentions CAPM conceptually but explicitly states they did not use it and instead used a simple average-return AR. There is no evidence of CAPM implementation (no beta estimation, market-return series, regression, or statistical outputs) nor the required explicit, block-by-block demonstration or verified code runs for a CAPM-based abnormal return.

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: student explicitly checked the assignment's numeric claim and identified the discrepancy.\n- Represent/Implement: student documented the correction and used the corrected value ($5) in the simulation and subsequent analysis.\n- Validate: student referenced data validation as part of verifying findings and proceeding with analysis.",
      "reasoning": "The student explicitly verified the prompt's numerical claim, documented the discrepancy (4 cents → ~$4–5 split‑adjusted), and demonstrated corrective action by using the corrected value in the simulation. This meets the requirement to verify and record numerical discrepancies, so PASS."

  "personalized_feedback": "Jacob—\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. In your work I see disciplined problem decomposition (you break finance problems into clear sub-questions), consistent use of assumptions and hypotheses, and concise explanations that make your logic easy to follow — exactly the traits that move a “monkey mind” into a systematic thinker. Your written reasoning often reads like a decision map: you state the question, list what you know, and show how each step links to your conclusion. That clarity is a real asset in finance teams.\n\nFor the next stretch, let’s translate that disciplined thinking into reproducible technical steps you can use on real business problems. Practical next steps:\n- Pick one core finance task (e.g., a DCF for a small company or a three-statement forecast). Create a one-page flowchart of inputs → calculations → outputs before building it.\n- Implement it in a spreadsheet with modular blocks (inputs, drivers, calculations, outputs). Annotate assumptions and create a sensitivity table to validate results.\n- Treat the model like a product: add a version log, simple checks (balance sheet balances, cash continuity), and a short README that explains how to run scenario tests.\n\nThese habits connect directly to business outcomes: clearer models speed decision-making in FP&A, more defensible assumptions improve investor conversations, and reproducible analyses save time under deadline.\n\nKeep going — your systematic approach is exactly what employers need. This is a career-long craft: every model and write-up will sharpen your judgment. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next."
