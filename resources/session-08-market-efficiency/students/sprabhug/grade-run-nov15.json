  "personalized_feedback": "Saniv — I’ve really enjoyed watching how you’ve shifted from reactive tinkering to a more methodical approach. You consistently label variables, document assumptions, and break problems into discrete steps — that clarity of thought is the exact hallmark of the DRIVER transformation. Your willingness to iterate (you re-ran scenarios after feedback) and to use AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch shows real maturation in computational thinking applied to finance.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Solidify the core finance formulas you use. For each model you build (e.g., DCF, working capital forecast), create a one-page “truth sheet” that states the formula, its business intuition, and common failure modes. Use that sheet every time you code a model so finance accuracy becomes routine.\n- Convert assumptions into testable checks. Implement simple sanity checks (e.g., margin bounds, ROIC ranges, cash flow sign checks) so your technical implementation catches conceptual mistakes early — this mirrors what risk teams do in practice.\n- Link model code to business KPIs explicitly. For each output, add a short memo: “who uses this, what decision it informs, and one sensitivity that would change the decision.” That strengthens both integration and stakeholder communication.\n- Follow the DRIVER checklist end-to-end before handing in work: Define, Reduce, Integrate, Validate, Explain, Repeat. Make that checklist visible during your next three projects and log one quick note on how each step changed the result.\n\nKeep going. Systematic thinking is the career multiplier — it turns ad-hoc answers into repeatable, defensible recommendations that leaders rely on. You’re on the right path; treat this as an escalating practice. I’m excited to see where you take these habits next."
