  "personalized_feedback": "Saniv — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve shifted from reactive problem-solving to a more disciplined, DRIVER-style approach. I’ve seen you consistently bring structure to messy finance problems: your submissions show clear decomposition of problems into components, you used named assumptions rather than buried numbers, and you’ve leveraged AI to prototype models quickly. Those habits — clarifying drivers, making assumptions explicit, and using tools to accelerate iteration — are exactly the mindset shift we aim for.\n\nNow, next steps to sharpen impact in real business finance contexts. First, tighten financial-concept accuracy: when you model revenue, cost, or working capital behavior, map each line item to an underlying business driver (e.g., customer acquisition, churn, AR days) and write one-sentence rationale for its dynamics. Second, improve technical implementation robustness by adding basic validation checks (e.g., balance sheet balancing, cashflow reconciliation, negative-value flags) so errors are caught early. Third, better integrate finance and technology by creating a “traceability” sheet that links each output back to the code cell or formula and to its business assumption — this helps managers trust the model. Fourth, adhere more consistently to the DRIVER steps: problem definition, decomposition, assumptions, verification, explanation, and repeat — use a 1-page checklist before submission. Finally, sharpen communication: lead with a 3-line executive summary that states the business question, key drivers, and decision implication.\n\nKeep treating this as an unfolding craft. The habits you’re building — explicit drivers, traceable logic, and clear summaries — are what turn finance work into decision-ready insight. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps to real company cases; you’re on a trajectory that will make you a trusted finance partner in any organization."
