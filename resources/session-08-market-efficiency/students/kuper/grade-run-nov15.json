  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the research question, lays out the empirical design (variables, market benchmark, event windows), and describes data verification steps, satisfying the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage. The plan is sufficiently concrete for replication and defense, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a replicable analysis framework—data inputs (price, volume, short interest), market model (S&P 500), and concrete event windows—satisfying the Represent-stage requirement. While some advanced statistical details (e.g., estimation window length, significance testing) are not spelled out, the planning and methodology are clearly stated and actionable, meeting the strict explicitness standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, repeatable workflow—defined data and benchmarks, implemented code, and produced multiple visual outputs—demonstrating systematic execution of the event-study methodology. While some advanced statistical details (e.g., significance testing) are not shown, the implemented, organized analysis meets the criterion for methodological execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong-form implications and attributes a short-term semi-strong breakdown to the GameStop event, showing conceptual grasp. However, treatment is brief and lacks detailed empirical justification or thorough explanation (e.g., why weak form is not violated, specifics of tests/results), so the work demonstrates correct but incomplete understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a basic, correct event-study approach (market model vs SPY, daily abnormal returns, plotted results) and implemented code, showing conceptual understanding. However, key methodological details and rigor are missing (no clear estimation/event window specification, no description of abnormal return formula, no statistical significance or cumulative abnormal return analysis), so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and an implemented event-study approach (abnormal returns vs market) indicating some analysis of information incorporation timing. However, the treatment lacks precise timing/statistical analysis (no event/estimation window details, significance testing, or finer granularity on how quickly information was absorbed), so the evidence supports a correct but incomplete evaluation.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Andrew —\n\nI want to recognize how your thinking has shifted this term. You’ve moved from ad‑hoc problem solving to framing finance problems with clear DRIVER logic: you consistently decompose questions into data, assumptions, models, and outcomes. Your written explanations are crisp — you articulate assumptions, walk through rationale stepwise, and translate model outputs into business implications. I’ve also noticed real progress in integrating finance and technology: your models begin to link numeric results to decision levers (pricing, capex timing, working capital), which is exactly the kind of systems thinking we want.\n\nNext steps — practical, concrete actions to tighten the remaining gaps:\n- Financial concepts: Revisit the handful of concepts that caused confusion (e.g., discounting timing, distinguishing operating vs. financing cash flows). Run a short sensitivity table for two examples (one where NPV flips sign with a small rate change, one where working capital lags change free cash flow) and write a 3–4 sentence executive takeaway for each. That practice ties textbook formulae to business tradeoffs.\n- Technical implementation: Treat your code/models as logic guardrails. Add one explicit validation step to every model: a unit check that total cash movements reconcile to P&L and balance sheet. This catches implementation drift without focusing on programming aesthetics.\n- Following DRIVER: Formalize your assumption log. For every model you build going forward, include a one‑page assumptions sheet stating source, expected range, and business consequence if that assumption shifts outside the range.\n\nKeep thinking of AI as your execution assistant: use it to generate alternative scenarios and to draft concise board‑level summaries, then apply your judgment to pick and refine the best outputs.\n\nThis is a career skill, not a course task. The systematic habits you’re building — explicit assumptions, scenario thinking, and tying models to decisions — will make you a clearer, faster, and more persuasive finance professional. Keep iterating; treat each model as an experiment that teaches you about the business. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
