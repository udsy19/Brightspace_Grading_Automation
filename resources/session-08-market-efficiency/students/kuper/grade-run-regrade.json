  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the market-efficiency testing problem with a stated goal, specific objectives (what will be verified and analyzed), and a concrete event timeline and data needs—meeting the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan/layout for the analysis (data inputs, market model, visual outputs, and event windows), satisfying the Represent requirement. The plan is actionable and specific enough that a reviewer could understand and reproduce the intended analysis, meeting the strict explicitness standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a planned, repeatable workflow (data sourcing, market benchmark, code in Colab, and multiple graphical outputs) consistent with systematic implementation. While some methodological details (e.g., precise estimation windows or statistical tests) are brief, the presence of organized inputs, implemented code, and multiple outputs satisfies the criterion for systematic execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and applies weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH distinctions to the GameStop event (evidence above), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is brief and lacks depth, quantitative support, and multiple detailed examples required for a thorough PASS, so it meets a partial but not full demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal-return testing and uses a market benchmark and code implementation, demonstrating conceptual understanding (Discover + Implement). However the submission lacks necessary methodological detail (estimation/event window, CAR, significance testing, clear abnormal-return formula), so the treatment is correct but basic and rates as PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly addresses information incorporation conceptually and uses data/abnormal-return plots to support claims, showing partial mastery. However, they omit rigorous measures of speed (explicit event/estimation windows, significance tests, or quantified reaction times), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Andrew —\n\nI’ve watched your shift from exploratory tinkering to deliberate, hypothesis‑driven analysis, and that transformation stands out. You consistently decompose finance problems into DRIVER’s discrete steps, lay out clear assumptions, and use AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch — for example, your recent cash‑flow breakdown and scenario table showed disciplined logic and prioritized what moves valuation most. That kind of structured thought is exactly what separates reactive work from decision‑grade analysis.\n\nFor next steps, focus on three practical moves that map directly to business finance work:\n1. Tighten financial-concept linkage — when you build a scenario, explicitly tie each assumption to a measurable business lever (e.g., conversion rate → revenue per cohort, inventory turnover → working capital). That will make your scenarios actionable for CFO-level decisions.\n2. Close the remaining technical gap by producing one short deliverable that translates model outputs into a stakeholder artifact: a one‑page memo or slide that states the recommendation, key drivers, and sensitivity bounds. This trains you to convert analysis into decisions.\n3. Strengthen the last DRIVER element you’re refining by codifying your checklist: before presenting results, run a 3‑question guardrail (Are assumptions documented? Which two drivers change the decision? What is the recommended action?). Use this in casework like budgeting or capital allocation.\n\nYou’re on a runway where systematic thinking compounds: the clearer your logic, the more confidently you’ll influence strategy and investments. Keep treating models as guardrails for judgment. I’m excited to see how you apply this to larger, real‑world finance problems next term — you’re building a career capability, not just completing assignments.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
