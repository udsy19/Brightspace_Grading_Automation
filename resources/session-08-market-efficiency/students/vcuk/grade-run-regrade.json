  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the testing problem and objectives (Discover) and showed a planned approach (Represent) to execute the test. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, stepwise plan for analyzing market efficiency—specifying the market-model approach, the pre-event estimation window, parameter estimation, and day-by-day abnormal-return calculations—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. This concrete layout is sufficient to pass the Represent criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a clear, systematic workflow—data retrieval, pre-event model estimation, day-by-day abnormal-return calculation, and visualization—then interprets outcomes, which satisfies the Implement criterion. While some implementation details are sparse, the end-to-end methodological execution is evident and consistent with the planned Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the semi-strong EMH test via an event-study (estimating alpha/beta and abnormal returns) and links behavioral/structural explanations—demonstrating understanding beyond superficial mention. However, treatment is focused almost entirely on the semi-strong form with limited or no explicit discussion of weak and strong forms and their distinct predictions, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented core event-study steps (data retrieval, pre-event market-model estimation, abnormal and cumulative abnormal return calculation) and interpreted results, showing conceptual competence. However, methodological detail is limited (no statistical significance testing, limited description of model specification, diagnostics, or robustness), so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly complete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework and interpreted abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns to assess how markets reflected information, showing conceptual competence. However, the analysis lacks depth on timing/latency metrics, statistical significance, robustness checks, and alternative explanations, so coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Van Uk —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from scattered “monkey mind” calculations to a repeatable, DRIVER-style approach. You’ve shown clear strength in structuring problems: your decomposition of a multi-period cash flow into discrete drivers, assumptions, and outcome metrics made it easy to trace how each input affects the business result. That traceability — linking revenue drivers to unit economics and then to free cash flow — is exactly the kind of systematic thinking that separates intuition from defensible analysis.\n\nNext steps to build on that momentum:\n- Make assumption provenance explicit. For each driver, add a short note: source (market data, management guidance, benchmark), confidence level, and a simple sensitivity range. In business finance this helps when presenting to stakeholders or reconciling forecasts to actuals.\n- Move from single-scenario outputs to a small scenario set (base/optimistic/downside) and a one-page summary showing which drivers flip the decision. Use this when evaluating investments or budgeting — it clarifies which risks to hedge or monitor.\n- Translate model outputs into decision triggers: e.g., “If EBITDA margin falls below X or working capital days widen by Y, pause hiring.” Framing numbers as operational triggers makes your analysis actionable for managers.\n\nKeep at it — this is a journey, not a finish line. The systematic habits you’re building (clear driver maps, documented assumptions, sensitivity framing) are high-leverage skills for any finance role — they make your analyses persuasive, auditable, and useful in real business decisions. I’m excited to see how you turn these patterns into faster, higher-impact work next term. Keep feeding your curiosity and keep applying that DRIVER discipline."
