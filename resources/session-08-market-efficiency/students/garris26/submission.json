  "transcript": "In this session, I explored the 2020 to 2021 spike in GameStop's stock prices, specifically focusing on the short squeeze phenomenon through the lens of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). I verified that the claim of GameStop trading at $0.04 in August 2017 was incorrect, as it actually traded between $3.77 and $5.10. The significant price spike in January 2021 peaked at $483, accompanied by a massive increase in trading volume. I found that while the weak and semi-strong forms of EMH were violated, the strong form held true, indicating no guaranteed profits for insiders. I encourage you to reflect on these findings and consider the implications for behavioral finance and market efficiency.",
