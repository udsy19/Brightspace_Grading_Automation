  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly interprets results (which EMH forms were violated/held) and links those conclusions to broader topics (behavioral finance, market efficiency), satisfying the requirement for explicit reflection. Contextual discovery and data validation are present and support a defensible reflective conclusion, so this criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and applies the three EMH forms to the event and verified key data, showing conceptual understanding (Discover/Implement/Reflect). However, the treatment is brief and lacks detailed explanation or multiple supporting examples linking specific evidence to why weak and semi-strong were violated and why strong form held, so the work is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies and verifies the event (Discover/Implement) and states EMH conclusions (Reflect) but provides no methodological details or calculations (no abnormal returns, CARs, market model, or significance testing). Because the required event-study methodology and abnormal-return computation are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links the event to EMH and notes price/volume evidence and form-level conclusions, showing an understanding of information incorporation conceptually. However, they do not analyze the speed or accuracy of incorporation (no timing, event-window analysis, or specific examples of information sources), so the treatment is correct but too brief for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Charlie — I’m genuinely pleased with how you’ve shifted from quick, ad-hoc answers to a reproducible, DRIVER-style approach. You consistently lay out objectives, identify relevant financial drivers, and structure your analysis so someone else can follow your logic; that’s the core of turning a “monkey mind” into a systematic thinker. Your use of clear decision checkpoints (e.g., stating assumptions before running scenarios) and your habit of summarizing results into business-friendly takeaways are concrete strengths I want you to keep leaning on.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Financial concept accuracy: When you translate model outputs into business decisions, add a short reconciliation step—map model line items back to the underlying financial statement equivalents (revenue → AR, depreciation → non-cash expense, etc.). That single habit will catch recurring conceptual slips.\n- Technical robustness without obsessing over code: Introduce lightweight validation checks into every deliverable (e.g., balance check, cash-flow sanity, and margin consistency). These are low-cost “logic guardrails” that protect business decisions and are easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.\n- Integration of finance and technology: For your next project, define two KPIs up front (e.g., free cash flow and customer acquisition cost) and show, in one slide, how model inputs move those KPIs across scenarios. Business leaders use those KPIs — showing the link increases persuasion.\n- DRIVER adherence: Keep naming the decision each step supports. If you’re deciding whether to invest or pivot, write that decision as a single sentence at the top of your work and revisit it after each analysis pass.\n\nYou’re on a real trajectory. Systematic thinking is the rare skill that turns analytical rigor into leadership influence — it will serve you across corporate finance, strategy, or entrepreneurship. Treat this as an iterative craft: each deliverable is a chance to tighten assumptions, validate them against the business, and tell a clearer decision story. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
