You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms and makes specific claims about which were violated in the GameStop episode, showing conceptual understanding (Discover/Implement). However, treatment is brief and lacks supporting argumentation or evidence for why weak and semi-strong were violated or why the strong form held, so the coverage is correct but incomplete rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses EMH qualitatively and verifies price facts (Discover/Implement) but provides no mention of event-study methodology, abnormal return calculations, estimation windows, or statistical testing required for market-efficiency testing. Because the core methods and calculations for an event study are missing, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly connects the GameStop episode to EMH and asserts weak/semi-strong violations, demonstrating an understanding that information was not perfectly or immediately incorporated. However, treatment is brief and lacks specifics on timing, measures, or evidence of how quickly markets reflected new information (no event timing, abnormal-return analysis, or concrete examples), so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Charlie —\n\nI want to recognize how clearly you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving toward the systematic thinking DRIVER encourages. You consistently decomposed problems into drivers and levers, wrote clear assumptions, and used AI purposefully as an execution assistant rather than a shortcut. Your written explanations of model logic were particularly strong — you translate finance ideas into plain language that a non-finance stakeholder could act on. That concreteness is a real asset when you’re translating analyses into business decisions.\n\nNext steps to build on that foundation (framed as practical actions you can take this week or over the next project):\n- Deepen the finance concepts that still need tightening: pick two core areas — e.g., discount rates vs. accounting cost, distinguishing cash flows from accounting earnings, and risk-adjusted return logic — and create one-page cheat sheets with formulas, intuition, and a short business example for each (project valuation, capital budgeting, performance evaluation).\n- Strengthen technical robustness: add a simple sensitivity and scenario tab to your next model and record the decision rule (if NPV range crosses zero under X% of scenarios, defer). That guards against overconfidence in point estimates.\n- Improve finance↔tech integration: for any output you produce, write one sentence linking the metric to a business action or KPI (e.g., “A 50-basis increase in WACC reduces project IRR below hurdle — delay hiring/scale back capex”). This makes your models actionable for managers.\n- Close two DRIVER loop gaps: define a measurable success metric up front and schedule a rapid postmortem after delivery to capture what assumptions were off.\n\nKeep treating this as an iterative craft. Systematic thinking will make you rare and valued in teams that must make high-stakes financial choices quickly. I’m excited to see how your next model ties cleaner finance intuition to clearer business decisions — you’re on a strong path. — Prof. Zhang"
