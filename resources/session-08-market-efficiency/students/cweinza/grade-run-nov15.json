  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes and applies a standard event‑study procedure (estimation/event windows, CAPM regression for alpha/beta, expected returns, abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal return) and documents data handling steps, demonstrating thorough methodological understanding. Minor numeric inconsistencies in the transcript do not undermine the correct and complete description and implementation of the event‑study methodology.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the provided Python code in Colab and describes block‑by‑block CAPM-based abnormal return computations (estimation/event windows, regression for alpha/beta, actual−expected ARs, CAR), demonstrating personal execution and technical understanding. They also show DRIVER stage mapping (plan, implementation, validation), meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration and ownership.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the research question, documents factual checks, specifies tickers and precise estimation/event windows, and states a clear analytical plan (CAPM event study plus data handling). Those explicit, documented elements satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies an event‑study (Implement) and links the quantitative abnormal returns to a semi‑strong EMH claim (Validate), showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment of weak and strong forms is asserted briefly without robust evidence or detailed argumentation, and some numeric inconsistency weakens thoroughness—so the work demonstrates correct understanding but not the comprehensive, detailed treatment required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements an event‑study and computes daily abnormal returns and a CAR, then links those results to semi‑strong inefficiency and causes (Reflect). However, the treatment lacks depth on the speed/temporal profile and statistical significance of information incorporation (e.g., intraday timing, significance tests, AR timing across days), so the understanding is correct but not comprehensive enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and links key biases (herding/coordinated buying, overconfidence) and structural limits to arbitrage, showing conceptual understanding. However treatment is brief and several specified biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not addressed and examples/depth are limited, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Clara — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve applied the DRIVER mindset to your work. Your technical implementation was crisp: the way you structured your notebook, documented assumptions, and executed reproducible steps shows you’re treating code as a logic guardrail, not an end in itself. More importantly, I noticed a real shift from scattered ideas to systematic workflows — you broke the problem into clear components (data inputs, calculation engine, outputs) and followed them through. That’s exactly the transformation from “monkey mind” to disciplined financial thinking I teach.\n\nFor next steps, let’s turn that structure toward tighter financial accuracy and stronger integration with business use cases. First, strengthen one lingering area of financial concept clarity: explicitly reconcile your assumptions with standard accounting definitions (e.g., distinguish EBIT from EBITDA when projecting cash flows). Practically, add a short assumptions-to-financial-statement map at the start of your model so stakeholders immediately see how each input affects net income, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. Second, deepen the finance–tech link: you’ve shown progress in automating outputs — now connect those outputs to decision-making. For example, produce a scenario table that maps model outputs to a recommended business action (e.g., delay capex, seek bridge financing, or price a product change). That turns analytic results into actionable recommendations for managers or investors.\n\nKeep nurturing this approach: systematic thinking will make you a better analyst, partner, and leader because organizations value people who convert ambiguity into decisive, documented action. This is a journey — you already have the habits that matter. Stay curious, keep translating assumptions into business consequences, and I’m excited to see where you take this next."
