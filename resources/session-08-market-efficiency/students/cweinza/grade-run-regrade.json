  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly described and executed the standard event-study procedure (estimation window, CAPM regression for alpha/beta, expected returns, ARs, and CAR) and reported numeric results and interpretation, demonstrating correct methodology and calculations. While additional robustness/significance checks would strengthen the analysis, the submission shows a thorough, correct application of event-study methods sufficient for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly explained the abnormal-return concept (AR = actual − expected), the CAPM-based implementation to generate expected returns, and calculated/interpreted CAR using code, demonstrating integration of finance concepts with technical execution. The explanation links method, numeric outcome, and economic interpretation sufficiently for a thorough, competent treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (case, objective to verify facts, scope) and provided clear operational definitions (tickers, estimation/event windows) plus a stated methodological plan (CAPM event study), meeting the DRIVER Define & Discover requirements. This explicit framing and planning satisfies the strictness for the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and describes the three EMH forms and applies an event-study (CAPM) to test semi-strong efficiency, showing conceptual understanding (Implement + Validate). However, the treatment is incomplete: tests for weak-form (e.g., serial correlation/trading rule evidence) and strong-form (direct insider-information evidence) are asserted rather than demonstrated, so the coverage is correct but not thorough. Thus PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used a standard event-study approach (estimation/event windows, CAPM, ARs/CAR) to evaluate information incorporation, demonstrating conceptual understanding and empirical application. However, the treatment omits tests of timing/speed (e.g., day-by-day significance, immediate vs. delayed reactions, intraday analysis) and formal statistical inference, so the analysis is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran code and described the abnormal-return calculation steps (AR = actual − expected, and CAR), showing an attempted technical implementation. However, under the strict standard they relied on AI-generated code and did not demonstrate block-by-block code-level understanding or explicit ownership of the implementation (no line/function-level explanation), so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Clara — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a clear, repeatable process. You consistently framed problems with DRIVER’s logic: you defined the objective clearly, isolated key drivers, and linked outcomes back to business questions. Your ability to blend finance intuition with technology — for example, using data-driven scenarios to stress-test a cash‑flow forecast — shows you’re already thinking like a systems builder, not just a calculator. That shift from “what if” thinking to “what follows” thinking is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nNext steps to deepen that transformation: tighten a few financial-concept and implementation gaps into deliberate habits. First, make assumption hygiene routine — for every model run, annotate the economic rationale (growth rates, margin drivers, working-capital lags) and cross-check against accounting identities (EBIT to NOPAT to free cash flow). In practice, this will improve forecasts used in budgeting, M&A screening, or capex justification. Second, formalize model validation: produce a short checklist and two sensitivity scenarios (optimistic / stress) before presenting results — this strengthens credibility for FP&A or investor conversations. Third, sharpen communication: lead each deliverable with a one-paragraph decision memo that states the recommendation, the key drivers, and the top two risks; add a simple chart that aligns drivers to outcomes so non-technical stakeholders can act quickly.\n\nYou’re on a real career trajectory: systematic thinking is a durable advantage whether you’re in corporate finance, consulting, or product strategy. Treat today’s feedback as the next set of techniques to practice — the framework you’ve built will compound. I’m excited to see your next models and how you turn these habits into business impact. If you want, bring a model to office hours and we’ll walk through a validation checklist together."
