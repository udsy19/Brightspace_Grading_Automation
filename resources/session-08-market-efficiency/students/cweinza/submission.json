  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Clara Weinzapfel and today I'm going to be going over the session 8 assignment. I started in the textbook reading over the entire assignment. The assignment is to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 through 2021 as a case study. Our job is to verify the accuracy of stated facts such as that it traded at 4 cents in August 2020. analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So I started by copying and pasting the session assignment into Google Gemini. I asked it to create a Python code that follows the driver formula and uses the kiss principle ensuring that all aspects of the project are met and all questions answered. So it then gave me a Python code that I was able to copy and paste here into Google Collab and then run the code over this analysis uses Python code to study the GameStop or GME short squeeze event specifically checking if the market was efficient or irrational. The entire study is structured using the driver framework to make sure we cover every step from checking facts to running the numbers and drawing conclusions. So starting off in the driver stage define and discover here this is where we set up the study and do the required factchecking. So here at number one is a fact check. The code immediately corrects a mistake which is the claim that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020 saying that it is false. The actual price range was much higher around 1.04 or $14 to $167. This is the first critical step of the assignment recognizing this mistake and defining the correct numbers. Moving down slightly to the ticker definitions, the code defines the assets GME ticker is GME and the market benchmark market ticker is the S SNP 500 index. Moving down to time windows, two crucial time periods are set. So first here in these first two lines we have the estimation estimation window October 1st to December 31st 2020 is used to see how GME normally behaved before the event. And then the second part is the event window January 15th to February 15th 2021 covers the actual short squeeze. And then when we go down to the bottom of the code, we can see this outlined here under driver stage one. It does the critical fact check and gives us the correct numbers for that. This section documents the plan and gets the necessary data. So the analytical plan is where it starts. As you can see right here, the script states the plan. Use an event study based on the CAPM to compare GME to the market. And then second is robust data download. The code first tries to download live adjusted closing prices using Y finance and then after that is the data fallback. So because external network connections can fail, which was happening when I went to run the code, a safety feature is included. If the live data download doesn't work, the script automatically switches to hard-coded historical data. This ensures the calculation part of the assignment always runs successfully. So here you can see the data inputed into the code. And following that is the return calculation. So after getting the prices, the script calculates the daily log returns, which is the standard way financial analysts measure daily percentage change for both GME and the S&P 500. And then lastly, stop check. A final check ensures the data exists before moving on. If not, the script prints a fatal error error and stops cleanly. So all of this code is going through um trying to get data online and then if that doesn't work going to the hardcoded data. So the next stage is driver stage three which is implement. This is the main calculation stage where the market efficiency test is run. So in this first section is the capm estimation using the estimation window. The code uses the returns from the estimation window to run a regression. This calculates GME's normal relationship to the market, giving us two key numbers, which you can see are down here, alpha and beta. So alpha is how much GME returned beyond what the market did. Expect it to be zero in an efficient market. And then beta is how sensitive GME's returns are to market movements, which is systematic risk. and then it goes to the expected returns. The calculated alpha and beta are then applied to the market's returns during the event window to find out what GME's return should have been which is the expected return. And then so it says that it's running the ordinary le squares regression following that is calculating abnormal returns for the event window. So the script finds the daily abnormal return by taking GME's actual return and subtracting its expected return. This shows the daily impact of the short squeeze. So here we have the expected the abnormal which we said was actual minus expected return. And then this shows that the calculated expected return is alpha plus beta times this R market value. And then lastly we have calculate cumulative abnormal return. This C value which is very high over 200% is the key piece of evidence showing the severity of the market event. So we scroll down into this section in the output and we can see in driver stage three we have the alpha the beta 033 the beta as 1.5618 then it goes on to the event study results which is the abnormal returns during short squeeze the total Total event days is 20 and cumulative abnormal return is.1555 or 15.55%. And then it gives us a note saying that a positive C suggests GME significantly outperformed its expected return which indicates a major market anomaly and a violation of semi- strong EMH. Stage four of driver is validate which is the interpretation of results. So this code is telling us what the numbers mean. For validation, the incredibly large positive C is the main validation point. A value this high confirms that GME's price movement was not based on fundamentals or normal risk. And then secondly, semi- strong EMH conclusion is that this massive C immediately proves a clear violation of the semi- strong form of the EMH, meaning the stock price did not reflect publicly available information like financial reports or company news. And we can also see this information in the output here when it tells us that R is extremely large and reiterates the information that I just said. St. Final two stages of driver five and six which are evolve and reflect. These final stages address the qualitative questions about market behavior and theory. So first here we have the market efficiency analysis. The script concludes that the event violated all three forms of the EMH. Here it says that the weak form is violated. So trading patterns were successfully exploited. The next the semi- strong form is also violated. Price did not reflect public information which is confirmed by the C. And the next the strong form is violated. Insiders like hedge funds so lost huge amounts showing private information offered no protection. And then next the behavioral finance analysis. The event was fueled by irrational behavior. So first we have hurting coordinated buying on social media drove prices and then next is limits to arbitrage which rational traders couldn't easily stop the rally because of high borrowing costs for shorting the stock. Next is overconfidence. The yellow mentality drove and mentally took over pushing risk tolerance to extreme levels. So next we have rational investor profitability. The script confirms that no systematic reliable profit opportunity existed based on fundamental analysis. profit was purely speculative and risky. And then last is theoretical implications. The GME event shows that while EMH might hold true long-term, short-term coordinated irrationality and trading difficulties can cause massive real world market anomalies. And this is also outlined again in these last sections when we run the code. It has numbers 1 through 4. The EMH violation classification, behavioral finance analysis, rational investor profitability, and theoretical implications. In conclusion, the comprehensive event study confirmed the initial GME of 4 cents price claim was false. The actual price was $14 through $167. The core quantitative result, an extremely large cumulative abnormal return, empirically proves a clear violation of the semi- strong form of the EMH as the price entirely ignored public fundamental value. This failure was fueled by behavioral finance hurting and overconfidence and structural issues like limits to arbitrage concluding that system systemic systematic rational profit opportunities did not exist. X ente and all three forms of the EMH were violated by the event.",
