  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem and frames testable hypotheses (EMH forms and implications), and links these to a research design (event-study/CAPM). This clear, stated problem definition and planned methodology meet the strict \"Define & Discover\" requirement, so the criterion is passed.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines a replicable framework: event-study design, CAPM expected-return model, clear formulas for AR and CAR, and an example 5-day event window with reported CAR. This level of methodological specification satisfies the strict Represent requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a systematic workflow: defines the event and hypotheses, specifies an event-study/CAPM framework, executes code to produce AR and CAR values, and interprets the results. While some methodological details (e.g., estimation window, formal significance testing) are not fully reported, the submission shows an organized, repeatable implementation that satisfies the DRIVER Implement requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains weak and semi-strong forms with concrete application (event study, CAPM, CAR) and interprets large abnormal returns as violations, demonstrating applied understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, treatment is incomplete for a thorough PASS because the strong-form efficiency is not explicitly discussed or analyzed; coverage lacks the comprehensive depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies core event-study elements (expected return model, AR, CAR) and provides numerical example outputs, showing practical implementation (Implement + Discover). However, the treatment lacks methodological depth (estimation window, model choice/robustness, statistical significance testing and inference), so it is a correct but incomplete execution and earns PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies event-study concepts (expected return model, AR, CAR) and uses the GME example to argue that markets did not fully and immediately incorporate public information, showing applied understanding (Discover + Implement + Reflect). However, the treatment lacks methodological depth on timing and statistical inference (estimation windows, formal significance/time-to-incorporation analysis), so the coverage is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Anamika — I’ve really enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation. You’ve moved from ad hoc thinking to a clear, repeatable approach: you consistently decompose finance problems into Drivers, Inputs, Returns, and Execution steps, and your models show disciplined logic guardrails (well-structured cash-flow mapping, explicit assumptions, and tidy sensitivity tables). That systematic habit — isolating the key drivers before diving into numbers — is exactly the mindset that separates reactive analysts from strategic finance partners.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will multiply the impact of your work. First, sharpen how you communicate model implications: lead with a one-paragraph executive summary that states the business decision, the top 2–3 drivers changing the outcome, and the recommended action. Annotate your model with short “why this matters” notes so a non-technical stakeholder can follow the chain from assumption to decision. Second, deepen the integration between your financial logic and business systems: create a simple KPI dashboard (even in a spreadsheet) that ties model outputs to operational metrics (customer acquisition cost, churn, contribution margin) and add a short scenario narrative for each table — what would we do if revenue falls 10% vs. rises 20%?\n\nKeep treating code and tools as execution assistants — the value is your finance-first logic. Over the next year, deliberately practice presenting two models to a business audience (peers, a product manager, or a simulated CFO) and solicit concrete “what would you change” feedback. That habit will accelerate your transition from analyst to trusted decision-maker.\n\nYou’re on a real trajectory, Anamika — systematic thinking like yours is career compound interest. Keep iterating the DRIVER loop; the framework will carry you into higher-leverage finance roles. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
