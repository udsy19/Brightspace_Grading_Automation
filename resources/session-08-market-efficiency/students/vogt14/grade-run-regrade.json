  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (objective and precise research question) and immediately linked it to a concrete methodological plan (CAPM-based event study and AR/CAR metrics). This clear, stated Discover stage plus a mapped Represent/Implement plan satisfies the strict requirement for defining and discovering the problem.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined a clear Represent stage mapping the research question to a concrete analytic plan (model, metrics, estimation window) and linked it to implementation steps, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit plan/layout. The level of detail (methods, metrics, and execution environment) allows a reviewer to understand and defend the proposed analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a systematic implementation: defined data sources/tools, executed code in Colab, and produced multiple quantitative outputs (beta, AR/CAR, significance tests). While some methodological/detail refinements could improve rigor, the submission demonstrates an organized, end-to-end execution of the planned Python analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and empirically tests EMH using CAR and statistical tests (Implement) and links results to behavioral explanations (Reflect), showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not clearly define or distinguish weak, semi-strong, and strong forms nor provide rigorous justification for labeling the event a strong-form violation, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements core event-study components (returns, CAPM-based expected returns, AR/CAR, t-test) demonstrating procedural understanding (Implement) and a clear research question (Discover). However, important methodological details and data validation are missing (e.g., precise estimation/event window choices, risk-free rate/return model specifics, robustness checks) and there is at least one flagged data error, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and implements core event-study tools to assess whether markets reflected information (Discover + Implement), and draws behavioral interpretations (Reflect). However, the treatment omits key details required to evaluate speed/accuracy of information incorporation (precise event windows, timing of information releases, robustness checks, and some data validation), and thus the analysis is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Max — I want to celebrate how you've shifted from scattered \"monkey mind\" work to a deliberate, repeatable approach. You consistently structure finance problems before diving in, make assumptions explicit, and walk through scenarios step-by-step — exactly the kind of systematic thinking DRIVER aims to instill. Your habit of mapping cash-flow logic and calling out key drivers when you present results shows real conceptual clarity. I also appreciate how you use AI thoughtfully as an execution assistant to speed analysis while keeping the economic intuition front and center.\n\nFor your next steps, treat the areas showing progress as high-impact refinements rather than gaps. Concretely:\n- Financial concepts: when a model result surprises you, trace it back to accounting identities (revenues → working capital → cash). Build lightweight reconciliation checks so model outputs always match basic financial statements. Apply this in business settings by running a quick “sanity path” whenever you close a forecast or valuation.\n- Technical implementation & integration: focus on reproducibility and validation. Create modular templates and one-page README notes for each model so anyone on a finance team can re-run and validate. Automate simple data quality checks (e.g., missing periods, negative margins) before feeding numbers into scenarios.\n- Communication: tighten your executive narrative. Start with the headline driver(s), show the sensitivity around them, then offer a recommended decision. Use one clear visualization per message to anchor stakeholder attention.\n\nKeep treating thinking as the primary tool — code and AI are guardrails to scale that thinking. The systematic habits you’re building will pay off across FP&A, corporate strategy, and investment roles. This is a career-long journey; pace yourself, iterate on your templates, and keep asking “what would a CFO want to know in two minutes?” I’m excited to see where you take this."
