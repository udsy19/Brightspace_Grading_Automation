  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency research problem and lays out a clear event-study research design (model, estimation/event windows, market benchmark, AR/CAR, and statistical test) and an implementation plan. This level of explicit planning and methodology meets the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit event-study framework—market benchmark (S&P 500), CAPM expected returns, definition of daily returns, estimation window, AR and CAR calculations, and use of statistical testing—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. This level of methodological detail is sufficient to defend the analysis design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, organized event-study workflow: data ingestion, return calculation, CAPM-based estimation window, abnormal-return and cumulative calculations, and statistical testing, producing concrete outputs. While some robustness/details (window lengths, adjustments) are not fully elaborated, the submission shows systematic implementation of the planned methodology, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames the EMH question and implements an empirical test (CAPM, AR/CAR, t-test) and links results to behavioral explanations, showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is not thorough: they assert a strong-form violation without clearly defining or distinguishing weak/semi-strong/strong forms or robustly justifying why strong form (rather than semi-strong) was violated, so the coverage is incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual use of event-study elements (estimation window, market model/CAPM, abnormal returns, CAR, and t-test) and implemented them in code (Implement), but treatment lacks methodological detail (choice/length of estimation/event windows, standard error adjustments, robustness checks) and contains data/interpretation issues, so the work is accurate but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual and practical use of event-study elements (estimation window, CAPM-based abnormal returns, CAR and significance testing) but does not analyze the timing/velocity of information incorporation (no explicit event-window timing, immediacy tests, or robustness checks) and overstates conclusions (claims strong-form violation without clear justification).

  "personalized_feedback": "Max —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve embraced the DRIVER mindset. You’re clearly moving from scattershot answers to a repeatable, structured approach: your problem breakdowns consistently isolate the key drivers, your written explanations tie assumptions to outcomes, and you’ve begun using “code as a logic guardrail” rather than an end in itself. I noticed real improvement in how you communicate financial logic—your reports are clearer about which assumptions matter most—and your willingness to use AI as an execution assistant shows strong, pragmatic computational thinking applied to finance.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (framed as actionable experiments you can run in real business settings):\n- Financial concept accuracy: pick a real company (or a business model you know) and build a two‑page memo that reconciles accounting line items to cash‑flow drivers. Practice tracing how a single assumption (pricing, growth, or margin) flows through income statement → cash flow → valuation. This trains you to spot conceptual slips that matter to decision makers.\n- Integration of finance & tech: convert one of your spreadsheets into a short decision tool: include an assumptions panel, one‑click scenario switches, and a table mapping outputs to business KPIs (e.g., CAC payback, free cash flow). Then present it as a 3‑slide recommendation for a management decision. That concrete link from model to action is what stakeholders value.\n- Following DRIVER rigor: adopt a 6‑bullet checklist you run before delivering any analysis (Define, Inputs, Run/sanity checks, Implement guardrails, Validate, Explain). Use that checklist in peer review sessions so the framework becomes habitual.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that matters. Systematic thinking—being able to convert messy business questions into transparent, repeatable financial logic—is what will differentiate you in FP&A, strategy, or entrepreneurship. Keep treating DRIVER as an iterative practice: small, deliberate tweaks now will compound into professional judgment that companies pay for. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
