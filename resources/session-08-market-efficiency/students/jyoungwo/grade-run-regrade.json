You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined all three EMH forms and applied appropriate empirical tests for weak (Ljung‑Box autocorrelation) and semi‑strong (event‑study CAR t‑test), reporting concrete statistics and clear conclusions, showing thorough understanding and application. Strong‑form was correctly described conceptually; overall depth and empirical support justify a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and comprehensively described and implemented event‑study methodology (market model, estimation vs event windows, AR and CAR calculations) and performed appropriate significance tests (t‑test on CAR, autocorrelation test), with concrete numeric results and interpretation. Minor wording mishaps aside, the treatment is detailed and applied correctly, satisfying a thorough understanding for this moderate assessment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tested how public information affected prices using an event study and abnormal‑return statistics, reported concrete CAR and t‑statistics, and interpreted them as evidence that markets failed to rapidly and accurately incorporate the information (semi‑strong violation). The methodology, numerical results, and synthesis demonstrate a thorough, correct treatment appropriate for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and described abnormal‑return calculations (AR, CAR) and reported concrete numerical results and significance tests, demonstrating practical execution. However, under the strict technical standard they did not present explicit code blocks, step‑by‑step implementation details, or block‑level explanations/verification of functions, so the evidence supports a partial rather than full technical pass.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jacob — you’ve made a clear shift from reactive thinking to a disciplined, DRIVER-led approach, and it shows. Your explanations of valuation mechanics and risk-adjusted returns were precise and tied directly to the decision logic we care about in finance. I also appreciated how you threaded technology into your analysis: the way you mapped out data inputs, transformation steps, and desired outputs demonstrated that you see code and tools as guardrails for the logic, not the end goal. Your write-ups followed the DRIVER sequence cleanly — you isolated the decision, framed the objective, identified relevant inputs, and articulated repeatable steps. That systematic pattern is exactly the mental model that separates ad-hoc answers from business-ready recommendations.\n\nFor the next leg of the journey, focus on tightening the technical implementation into business artifacts you’d hand a CFO or FP&A lead. Practical next steps:\n- Build a one-page cash-flow prototype in a spreadsheet reflecting your DRIVER logic (inputs, transformational formulas, and outputs), then run 3 scenario runs (base/optimistic/downturn).\n- Create sensitivity tables for the 3 most impactful assumptions so stakeholders can see leverage quickly.\n- Document the decision rules in plain language alongside the model (if X changes by Y, then do Z), so non-technical reviewers can audit the logic.\n- Pair these with a short slide that connects model outputs to concrete actions (e.g., adjust working capital cadence, amend capex timing).\n\nKeep leaning on AI as your execution assistant to automate repetitive checks, but keep the DRIVER framework as your compass. The systematic thinking habit you’re building will compound — it makes you faster at solving messy, real-world finance problems and more persuasive when translating analysis into action. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
