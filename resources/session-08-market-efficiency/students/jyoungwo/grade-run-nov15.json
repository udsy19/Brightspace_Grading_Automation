  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly described and applied event‑study methodology (market model, estimation/event windows), computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and ran appropriate significance tests with interpretation, satisfying thorough application expectations. Minor presentation issues (e.g., a brief wording confusion about beta sign) do not undermine the complete, applied demonstration of the event‑study and abnormal return calculations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied event‑study methodology with clear estimation/event windows, computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and used significance/autocorrelation tests to show public information was not quickly or accurately reflected. They further contextualized results (limits to arbitrage, trading halts), providing a thorough, applied treatment sufficient for PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student went beyond basic computations by computing CARs, running significance and autocorrelation tests, producing visualizations, and drawing substantive, data‑backed conclusions about predictability, persistence, limits to arbitrage, and policy responses. The workflow follows DRIVER stages from problem framing through execution and synthesis, demonstrating robust data‑driven insight.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the three EMH forms and applied appropriate empirical tests (market model/CAR with t‑test for semi‑strong; Ljung‑Box for weak), and concluded dual violations, showing solid conceptual and applied understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for a full PASS because the strong form was only mentioned qualitatively and not examined or tested in depth, so the coverage is correct but not thoroughly comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invoked behavioral finance and provided concrete discussion of herding and confirmation bias, and linked empirical results (autocorrelation, persistent CARs) to behavioral explanations, showing applied understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: several specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly analyzed or illustrated in depth, so the coverage is correct but not comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and empirically tested momentum/predictability (autocorrelation, CARs) and linked results to behavioral explanations, demonstrating applied understanding. However, they did not meaningfully address value effects, size effects, or calendar anomalies, so coverage is correct but incomplete.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly verified the prompt's numerical claim, used a named historical data source (Yahoo Finance) to obtain corrected values ($1–$1.70), and documented the correction to the instructor. This satisfies the requirement to verify numerical claims and record discrepancies."

  "personalized_feedback": "Jacob —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve begun to think like a systematic finance practitioner. In your recent work I noticed two concrete strengths: you consistently tied technology choices back to specific finance questions (e.g., selecting scenario automation to stress-test free cash flow drivers), and you used the DRIVER logic guardrails to structure analyses so that assumptions, computations, and conclusions were traceable. Those habits — translating business problems into defensible model structure and explaining the chain from assumption → calculation → decision — are exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nFor your next steps, focus on sharpening two practical areas so your analyses are business-ready. First, deepen the financial-concepts layer: when you set assumptions, explicitly map each one to the accounting line or cash-flow item it affects, and reconcile model outputs to a simple pro forma income statement and cash-flow statement. Practically, add a one-page “assumption map” to each deliverable and run a quick balance-sheet reconciliation — this makes models intelligible to CFOs and investors. Second, strengthen model robustness: build a short checklist of error checks (signs that working capital went negative, growth rates outside historical bounds, or circular references) and automate a few key sensitivity runs. Those steps keep your logic defensible in high-stakes business decisions like budgeting or valuation.\n\nKeep going — your move from scattered thinking to a reproducible, explainable process is a career-defining shift. Treat DRIVER as a discipline you carry into meetings, memos, and investor conversations. With the small practices above, you’ll convert neat analyses into trusted inputs for real finance decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this."
