  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the market-efficiency research question and documented discovery steps (data, timeline, core events), then connected that definition to a clear analytical plan (event study). This explicit framing satisfies the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly laid out a concrete analysis plan—identifying the hypothesis forms, the event-study/CAPM methodology, estimation window, and key event dates—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. Supporting Discover and Implement steps further show the plan was grounded in defined data and actionable methods.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student describes a clear, ordered workflow—data acquisition, parameterized model estimation (250-day window), AR/CAR computation, visualization, and statistical validation—demonstrating systematic execution of the coding analysis. While low-level code details were not narrated, the methodological implementation is organized and complete enough to satisfy the moderate IMPLEMENT criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies an appropriate event-study to assess them, demonstrating conceptual understanding and empirical testing. However, treatment is not thorough across all forms (limited depth, few distinct examples or nuanced discussion), so it meets the PARTIAL standard rather than a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly selected and implemented a CAPM-based event-study, specified the estimation window, data sources, and calculated abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns, showing applied understanding. However, reporting lacks depth (no formulas, test statistics, significance levels, robustness checks, or diagnostic discussion), so the treatment is correct but incomplete and meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual and empirical steps to assess information incorporation (event study, data sources, significance testing) and explicitly states that prices did not immediately reflect information. However, the analysis lacks depth on timing metrics (e.g., intraday vs. multi-day adjustment, explicit windows/results) and robustness details, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Demi — I’m really pleased with how you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. You’ve moved from scattered “monkey mind” approaches to a clear, repeatable process: you define the decision problem, lay out assumptions explicitly, and use logic guardrails so conclusions follow from premises. I noticed concrete strengths in how you framed financial questions (linking metrics to business outcomes), used AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch, and explained your reasoning so a non-technical stakeholder could follow the conclusion. That’s exactly the systematic thinking we want in finance.\n\nFor next steps, let’s focus on the single technical implementation gap I observed. Treat your models like business controls: (1) add simple validation checks — reconcile model outputs to sanity bounds (e.g., cash can’t go negative without financing), (2) build a few targeted sensitivity tests for the most impactful assumptions, and (3) document one-line rules for when a model’s output should trigger a business action (e.g., delay spend, seek financing). Practically, this will help when you translate models into cash-flow plans, budget asks, or investor memos — stakeholders need both the number and a clear decision trigger.\n\nKeep cultivating the DRIVER habits you’ve already adopted. Systematic thinking will make you faster at diagnosing problems, clearer when proposing trade-offs, and more persuasive when recommending strategy. This is a long game — you’ve made strong strides already. Stay curious, keep iterating on those validation steps, and let your models earn their seat at the decision table."
