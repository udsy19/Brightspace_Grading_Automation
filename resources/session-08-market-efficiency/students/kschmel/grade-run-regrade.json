  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, applies them to a concrete case, and provides quantitative analysis (mean abnormal return, simulation results) to support claims of violations. Their use of DRIVER stages (discover, implement, reflect) demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the testing problem (scope, objective, and hypothesis) and documented initial discovery actions (data verification and timeline). This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a representational plan: constructed a timeline, specified efficiency benchmarks and the return models (CAPM → expected/abnormal returns, CAR), and described a simulation/event-window implementation (risk-free, market inputs, January–March simulation). These explicit planning elements satisfy the strict Represent requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and applies core event-study elements (expected return model, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and executed simulations to produce quantitative results, showing applied understanding. However, the treatment lacks key methodological details (estimation/event window choices, test statistics/standard errors, model selection and robustness checks), so the work is correct but not fully thorough, yielding a PARTIAL score.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information incorporation (semi-strong definition) and computes abnormal returns from a focused event, showing applied understanding. However, the analysis lacks thoroughness on timing and accuracy measures (no explicit event-window timing tests, test statistics/standard errors, or robustness checks), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they built and ran code, describes key implementation steps (input setup, simulation windows, beta and abnormal-return calculations), and reports quantitative results—showing attempted abnormal-return calculations. However, under the strict technical standard they do not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit run/verification statements, or methodological details (estimation windows, statistical tests, code excerpts), so the evidence supports a partial—not full—demonstration.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Katherine — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER approach. You consistently decomposed problems into crisp sub-questions, stated assumptions up front, and produced reproducible logic paths — for example, your stepwise breakdown of the cash-flow drivers and your explicit sensitivity variables made it easy to follow the financial reasoning. That level of systematic thinking is exactly what moves someone from “tinkering” to reliable financial analysis.\n\nFor the next steps, treat the areas where you’re already showing progress as targeted growth opportunities rather than gaps. Two practical actions:\n- Strengthen the financial-concepts thread by running structured scenario and sensitivity analyses on a real business case (e.g., a three-year forecast for a product line). Document how each assumption (price, volume, margin) maps to tangible KPIs and decision thresholds — this will improve rigor when you advise management on capital allocation or pricing choices.\n- Deepen the integration between your models and business decisions. Translate model outputs into a one-page decision memo or dashboard that answers: “If X happens, do we invest, pause, or pivot?” Include simple validation checks (backtest assumptions against past quarters) to build credibility with stakeholders.\n\nA few small habits that scale: always add a short “assumption impact table,” run a best/worst/base scenario set, and write one clear recommendation sentence for each scenario. These make your work actionable for finance teams and executives.\n\nYou’re on a career-defining trajectory: systematic thinking becomes your signature skill in any finance role. Keep treating analysis as a decision tool, not just computation. I’m excited to see where you take this — keep pushing toward real-business applications and keep using AI as an execution partner to accelerate, not replace, your judgment."
