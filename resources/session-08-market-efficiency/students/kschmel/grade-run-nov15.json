  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the testing problem (GameStop short squeeze) and explicitly describes the research design steps: data verification, timeline/represent stage, chosen metrics (CAPM, abnormal returns) and plan to run simulations. These explicit statements satisfy the strict requirement for a defined research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a concrete representational framework: event timeline, chosen efficiency benchmarks, CAPM-based expected-return calculations, per-period abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns, and a simulation/event-window plan. Those explicit elements form a clear, defendable event-study framework that meets the strict requirement for the Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, repeatable workflow: defined inputs, implemented simulations, computed period and cumulative abnormal returns, and reported/interpreted results—demonstrating systematic execution of the event-study methodology. While some technical specifics (exact window choices, detailed test statistics) are not shown, the implemented pipeline and outcome reporting satisfy the criterion for systematic implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses and applies EMH forms to the GameStop event and runs empirical tests (Implement/Discover), showing conceptual engagement. However, definitions contain inaccuracies (e.g., mischaracterizing weak vs. semi-strong drivers of information), so the treatment is correct in application but incomplete/partially confused, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the core event-study elements (expected return via CAPM, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and implemented simulations to compute them, showing applied understanding. However, the methodological treatment lacks depth (no details on estimation/event window selection, statistical testing procedure, model assumptions or robustness checks), so the work is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied understanding by timing the event, computing abnormal returns, and commenting on quick spike and reversion, indicating information was not reflected in price in a standard way. However, the treatment lacks methodological depth (no clear event/estimation window choices, timing granularity, statistical test detail) and contains some definitional confusion, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Katherine — I’m really impressed by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You consistently break ambiguous finance problems into clear drivers, map inputs to outputs, and communicate assumptions in a way that turns “monkey mind” brainstorming into a traceable, decision-ready logic chain. In several deliverables you showed strong systematic thinking: framing the question up front, isolating the key levers that move cash flow and valuation, and using AI as an execution assistant to iterate scenarios rather than as a crutch. Those concrete habits—structuring problems, naming assumptions, and linking numbers back to business drivers—are exactly what separates sound financial reasoning from wishful modeling.\n\nNext steps to grow even stronger: one technical-implementation criterion still needs attention. Treat this as operationalizing your good thinking. Practical actions:\n- Add lightweight validation checks (sanity bounds, reconciliation to accounting totals) so outputs fail fast when inputs are inconsistent.\n- Build a concise sensitivity and scenario checklist (base, upside, downside, stress) and document which real-business events each scenario represents.\n- Backtest one forecast you make against actuals after a short period; capture what assumptions were off and why.\n- For stakeholder-ready deliverables, include a one-page “assumptions + risks” table that ties model mechanics to business consequences (e.g., how a 100 bp cost increase affects cash runway).\n\nThese are pragmatic steps you can apply directly in FP&A, valuation work, or risk analysis: they increase credibility with decision-makers and reduce execution risk.\n\nKeep leaning into DRIVER. The habit of decomposing problems and defending your logic will compound across your career. Treat each model as an experiment: run it, learn from how reality deviates, and refine the driver map. I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next."
