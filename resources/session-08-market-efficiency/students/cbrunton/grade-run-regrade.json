You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, accurate definition of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, maps those definitions to explicit tests (event windows, CAPM residuals), and supplies quantitative evidence (regression statistics and event-study CARs) with interpreted conclusions. That combination of conceptual clarity, multiple applied tests, and data-driven interpretation meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly specified an event-study framework, implemented abnormal-return calculations (actual − CAPM expected) and cumulative abnormal returns over defined windows, and presented quantitative results and visuals interpreting those CARs. That combination of methodological design, applied computation, and interpretation meets the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student implemented a correct event‑study approach (event windows, CAPM expected returns, ARs and CARs) for multiple, well‑chosen events and interpreted how CARs changed around those dates, addressing both accuracy and timing at the daily level. They also acknowledge limitations (no intraday analysis) and propose appropriate extensions, which supports a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and maps them to testable procedures and events, then interprets empirical results against those forms. However, the explanations are concise and applied rather than deeply detailed or theoretically thorough, so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive enough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Caleb — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve shifted from fragmented reasoning to the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently demonstrate deep command of core finance concepts (your treatment of valuation drivers and risk decomposition was especially clear), and you’ve tied that thinking to a disciplined decision structure: you break problems into drivers, articulate assumptions, and trace implications cleanly. I also noticed your thoughtful use of tools and AI as an execution assistant — not as a crutch — which kept your logic transparent and repeatable. That combination of conceptual clarity and systematic process is exactly what converts “monkey minds” into strategic thinkers.\n\nFor your next steps, take that same DRIVER discipline into business-facing applications. Start by translating driver-level analyses into management metrics: map your valuation drivers to operating KPIs (revenue per customer, churn, unit economics) and build simple scenario templates that managers can use in planning cycles. Add a structured sensitivity and stress-test routine: for each key driver, specify plausible ranges, likelihoods, and decision triggers (e.g., “if churn > X for two quarters, execute Plan B”). Practice communicating those triggers as short, actionable memos for nontechnical stakeholders. Finally, experiment with probabilistic overlays (bootstrap or monte-carlo) on one of your models to quantify uncertainty — not to complicate things, but to inform contingency planning.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is a career multiplier. As you move into real-world projects, the DRIVER habits you’re forming will let you diagnose faster, recommend clearer actions, and earn trust from leaders. Treat this as an evolving craft: refine your templates, gather business outcomes, and let those feedback loops sharpen your judgment. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next."
