  "personalized_feedback": "Ramon — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve started to think like a disciplined finance practitioner. You consistently break messy problems into repeatable steps, you’ve shown progress tying quantitative outputs back to business questions, and you’re using AI as an assistant rather than a crutch — that shift from “monkey mind” ideas to a stepwise approach is exactly the DRIVER transformation we aim for. Your explanations have gotten clearer when you present model results to non-technical stakeholders, which is a critical strength.\n\nNow for next steps to turn that momentum into measurable impact. Several foundational finance concepts still need tightening (cash flow vs. accounting earnings, discount-rate selection, and risk-adjusted return interpretation are common pain points). Actionable next step: pick one live business decision (e.g., capital budgeting for a new product), explicitly write out the cash-flow drivers and a defensible discount-rate choice, then run a simple NPV and sensitivity analysis and document assumptions in one page for stakeholders. On the technical side, focus on validation: add small, transparent checks (sanity tests and scenario runs) to show your model behaves as expected under edge cases. For DRIVER adherence, make “Define the decision” and “State assumptions” explicit at the top of every deliverable — this will make your work immediately more actionable to managers.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is a career multiplier. Every disciplined workflow you build now will make you faster and more persuasive in real business finance settings. I’m excited to see your next iteration; bring a business question and we’ll workshop the assumptions and validation together."
