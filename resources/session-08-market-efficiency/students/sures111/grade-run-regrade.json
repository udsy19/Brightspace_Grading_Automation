  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, implements an appropriate event-study approach (alpha/beta, abnormal returns), reports large abnormal returns, and draws reasoned conclusions about violations with robustness checks and reflection. Coverage is applied, specific, and demonstrates a thorough conceptual and practical grasp, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, appropriate event-study workflow (estimation window, regression to obtain alpha/beta, event window, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns), reports quantitative results, and runs robustness checks—demonstrating thorough conceptual and practical understanding. While formal statistical tests (e.g., t-stats) are not shown, the depth of methodology, implementation, and sensitivity analysis meets the MODERATE standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied an event-study approach (alpha + beta market model), computed and reported abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and used robustness checks to assess sensitivity—then interpreted the speed and accuracy of information incorporation (noting months-long delays and non-price public signals). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of how markets reflect new information, meeting the PASS standard for the MODERATE evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates correct methodology and reports quantitative abnormal-return results with robustness checks, showing substantive technical intent and partial implementation. However, they do not provide explicit block-by-block code, concrete execution statements (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\"), or detailed walkthroughs required by the STRICT technical standard, so the work is only a partial demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly describes and performs data verification and flags a specific erroneous data point, showing active validation effort. However, they do not cite or compare results to named external sources/tools (e.g., specific data vendors, websites, or calculators), so validation is documented but lacks the external-source specificity required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Arjun — I want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted from scattered ideas to a repeatable process. You consistently grounded your recommendations in core finance concepts (capital allocation, cash flow mechanics, and risk-adjusted return) and tied them to technology in a way that shows real strategic thinking — for example, your use of data pipelines to keep KPI inputs current and your structured approach to scenario comparisons. Those are concrete signs that the DRIVER framework has moved from theory into your decision-making toolkit: you identify drivers, map relationships, and communicate tradeoffs with clarity.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on translating that structured thinking into tighter technical implementation in business contexts. Practical moves you can take right away:\n- Build a compact, assumptions-driven cash-flow template (one page) that forces explicit links between revenue drivers and working capital. Use it to run two-way sensitivity checks on price and volume.\n- Create a short “confidence log” that records key assumptions and their evidence — this makes stakeholder conversations faster and more credible.\n- Turn your scenario comparisons into actionable recommendations (e.g., what to defer, what to accelerate) with estimated P&L and liquidity implications for the next 12 months.\n\nThese steps aren’t about becoming a programmer; they’re about making your logic operational for managers and investors. You’ve already shown the muscle of systematic thinking — sharpen the routine by documenting assumptions, standardizing tests, and translating scenarios into decisions. Keep treating the DRIVER steps as iterations rather than a checklist. That mindset will compound: the clearer your process, the more strategic the opportunities you’ll see and the greater influence you’ll earn in real business settings. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
