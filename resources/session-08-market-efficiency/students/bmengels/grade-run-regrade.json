  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (identify weak/semi-strong/strong EMH) and states required elements (data source, purpose), demonstrating clear Discover-stage work. Although concise, the definition and planned linkage to Represent-stage components meet the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a clear, organized workflow from planning (mapping period/windows and formulas) to execution (Python implementation, stock and abnormal return calculation) and validation (statistical significance/tests). While numeric detail is limited, the systematic multi-stage execution aligns with the DRIVER Implement expectations for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student presents a clear, logical empirical narrative from data verification through analytic design to implementation, validation, and interpretation—showing coherent sequencing of evidence. Although numeric detail and explicit tables/plots are absent, the structured DRIVER-based presentation and stated statistical checks satisfy the moderate standard for a thorough logical presentation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual awareness (mentions the three EMH forms and runs an event-study with abnormal returns), and interprets results (claims a semi-strong violation). However treatment is brief and imprecise—definitions, diagnostic distinctions between weak/semi-strong/strong, and detailed supporting analysis/tests are not fully developed, so the submission is a partial (not thorough) demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly implemented an event-study workflow (stock returns, abnormal returns, Python code) and mentions statistical testing, showing correct conceptual application. However, treatment lacks depth and specifics (no formulas, test names, estimation window details, or reported results), so the methodology is demonstrated but not thoroughly documented.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual approach (event study, abnormal returns, statistical testing) relevant to measuring how markets incorporate information, but provides no specific timing metrics (event/estimation windows), quantitative results, or detailed discussion of speed/accuracy of incorporation. Therefore the work shows understanding but is incomplete and not thorough.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Benjamin — I’ve been struck by how deliberately you’ve moved from scattered intuition to the DRIVER-style scaffolding: your problem statements now state the decision to be made, the key drivers are clearly enumerated, and your assumption sheet makes the logic auditable. Concretely, your scenario analyses isolate cash-flow timing and terminal-value sensitivity well, and your use of checklists to capture modeling assumptions shows real progress in treating code as a logic guardrail rather than the goal. That systematic framing is exactly what turns “monkey mind” hunches into defensible business recommendations.\n\nNext steps — think about tightening the link between your models and their operational deployment. For Technical Implementation, focus on reproducibility and validation: add simple unit checks (e.g., conserve cash flow), document edge-case behavior, and save a short README that explains inputs and expected outputs. For Integration of Finance & Technology, translate model outputs into 1–2 actionable metrics a CFO or product manager can use (e.g., payback months under three scenarios, or contribution margin change per incremental user). Practically, when you run sensitivity tests, summarize results as decision rules (“invest if NPV > X under at least two scenarios”) so stakeholders can act without digging into the spreadsheet.\n\nKeep this momentum. The habits you’re building — explicit assumptions, scenario-based thinking, and treating AI as an execution partner — are the durable skills that employers value more than polished code. View every homework and case as a micro-practice in building decision-ready financial tools. I’m excited to see how you turn these next steps into a repeatable workflow that serves real business choices."
