You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, ordered workflow—designing the event-study framework, implementing it in Python to compute stock and abnormal returns, and validating results with statistical tests and factor adjustments—demonstrating systematic execution of the methodology. This meets the Implement criterion for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names the three EMH forms and shows an event-study workflow (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT) and interpretation (REFLECT), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief and lacks depth (no clear, detailed distinctions, tests, or multiple examples), so the work meets a basic but incomplete standard and is scored PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes an event-study workflow (identifying EMH, implementing in Python, computing stock and abnormal returns, and testing significance), showing conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks methodological detail (no explicit formulas, test statistics, estimation window specifics, or worked results), so the treatment is correct but basic and thus PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual steps for testing how information is incorporated (identifying EMH form, running an event study, computing abnormal returns, and testing significance), showing basic understanding. However, treatment is superficial—no detailed timing analysis (e.g., intraday vs. multi-day CARs), explicit estimation windows, or concrete results—so it meets a partial but not thorough standard.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Benjamin —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted toward the DRIVER way of working. In your recent assignments you consistently decomposed problems into logical parts, communicated assumptions plainly, and linked model outputs back to business decisions — concrete signs that your “monkey mind” is turning into a systematic planner. Your work showed steady progress across multiple financial-concept criteria, good integration of finance and technology (you’re already using data to inform assumptions), and clear, audience-aware explanations that make your analyses easy to act on.\n\nFor next steps, treat the remaining gaps as targeted practice opportunities rather than setbacks. One financial-concept item needs tightening: double-check timing and sign conventions for cash flows and discounting in your capital-budget examples—misplacing an initial outflow or mis-applying the discount rate changes NPV materially in business cases. On the technical side, strengthen your model’s guardrails: add input validation, document key formulas, and run sensitivity scenarios for the top 3 drivers (revenue growth, margin, discount rate). For following DRIVER more rigorously, make the Decision and Rules nodes explicit in every deliverable (e.g., “Decision: accept project if NPV>0 and IRR>cost of capital; Rules: conservative revenue growth = 3–5%”). These steps directly map to real finance tasks like investment appraisal, forecasting for budgeting cycles, and communicating recommendations to stakeholders.\n\nKeep building this momentum. Systematic thinking will make you faster and more persuasive in real-world roles — from FP&A to corporate development — because it turns intuition into repeatable, auditable advice. This is a career-long journey; every tightened assumption and added test makes your work more trustworthy. I’m excited to see your next iteration.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
