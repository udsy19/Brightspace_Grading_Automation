  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and clearly explains all three EMH forms, applies them to a concrete event-study example, and integrates behavioral explanations for deviations. This combination of accurate definitions plus applied examples and reflection meets the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly connects EMH theory with behavioral finance, applies biases to a concrete event-study scenario, and produces a clear reflective synthesis about practical implications. This integrated, explicit treatment meets the strict requirement for Reflect.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student provides a clear, accurate explanation of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applies those concepts to a concrete event-study example, and synthesizes implications for real-world analysis. This combination of accurate theory, applied example, and practical reflection meets the threshold for a thorough, well-communicated treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the conceptual logic of an event study and how abnormal post-event drift signals inefficiency (Implement and Represent), but they do not present methodological detail (e.g., estimation window, market model, abnormal return/CAR calculations, or statistical testing). That correct but limited treatment fits PARTIAL under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains, conceptually, how quickly markets should incorporate public information and uses an event-study thought experiment to illustrate speed and accuracy (Implement/Represent). However, they do not provide methodological detail, quantitative measures, or empirical testing (estimation windows, abnormal returns, statistical inference), so the treatment is accurate but limited.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies four key biases to a realistic example and reflects on their impact, showing clear conceptual understanding (Validate/Implement/Reflect). However, treatment is brief and omits mental accounting (one of the required biases) and lacks deeper examples or mechanisms, so the coverage is accurate but incomplete, matching PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Juan — I’ve enjoyed watching your shift from ad-hoc problem solving to the steadier, systematic approach DRIVER prizes. Two concrete strengths stand out: your habit of decomposing a finance problem into smaller modules (you consistently isolate cash-flow logic from policy rules), and your disciplined use of decision “guardrails” — you state constraints and stop conditions before turning to execution. Those moves show real progression from a monkey-mind to a dependable thinker.\n\nNext steps to accelerate that momentum. First, tighten one remaining financial-concepts gap by making assumptions explicit and testable: for example, when you project terminal value or discount rates, attach a short rationale (market comps, WACC build-up) and run a two-scenario sanity check. That ties the math back to business reality (M&A, investment approval). Second, address the lingering technical implementation miss by adding a small validation layer: unit-check critical formulas against hand-calculated benchmarks and flag out-of-range results automatically. Third, sharpen communication: lead with a one-paragraph executive takeaway, then present 3 bullets linking model outputs to decisions (hire, defer, invest), and append a short “what would change the decision” sensitivity table. These are practical habits that managers use in board memos and investor decks.\n\nKeep treating AI and code as execution helpers, not substitutes for judgment. Your growing discipline in DRIVER is exactly the skillset finance leaders need — it makes your analyses reproducible, defensible, and persuasive. This is a long game; keep iterating on assumptions, validations, and concise storytelling. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
