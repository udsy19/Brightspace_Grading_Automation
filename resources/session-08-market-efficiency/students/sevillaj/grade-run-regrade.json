  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately and clearly defined all three EMH forms and applied the semi-strong form via a concrete event-study example, then validated limitations using behavioral finance. Coverage is correct, applied, and nuanced, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately explained how quickly markets should incorporate public information under the semi-strong form and applied that to a clear event-study example, including detection of post-event drift. They also noted realistic limitations (behavioral biases) affecting accuracy, demonstrating a thorough, nuanced conceptual understanding suitable for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission clearly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (a large valuation vs. market-price gap), frames it with a concrete fictional example, and lists specific investigative questions. This explicit problem definition meets the strict DRIVER requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding of event-study logic and interprets post-event drift, but does not demonstrate the technical steps or abnormal-return calculations (e.g., estimation window, market model, AR/CAR computation, statistical testing). This is therefore a correct but basic treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission discusses an event study conceptually but contains no explicit abnormal-return calculations, no estimation/estimation-window or event-window details, no AR/CAR formulas or numerical results, and no evidence of code execution or verification. Under the STRICT technical standards requiring explicit demonstration, this fails to meet the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student correctly described the event-study logic and interpreted post-event price drift (conceptual basis for abnormal returns), but did not explain abnormal-return metrics, calculation steps (AR/CAR), estimation/event-window choices, or provide numerical/example calculations. This demonstrates correct but basic coverage, so PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Juan Antonio —\n\nI’ve noticed real changes in how you approach problems with the DRIVER mindset. You now break complex finance questions into clear subproblems, articulate the assumptions before you build, and use checkpoints to guard logic flow — all signs that your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker. In our group work you consistently surfaced the key drivers (revenue growth vs. margin levers) and translated them into model inputs, which made our scenario comparisons far more transparent and business-focused.\n\nFor your next steps, treat the remaining technical implementation gap as a targeted drill rather than a setback. Concretely:\n- Add lightweight validation checks to your models (e.g., balance reconciliation, non-negative cash flows, reasonableness bands for ratios). These act as automated guardrails when you iterate forecasts for a capital-allocation decision.\n- Build one sensitivity table per model that shows how NPV/IRR or free cash flow reacts to the top two drivers. That will make tradeoffs explicit for stakeholders.\n- When integrating tech, focus on reproducibility: save raw inputs, document transformation steps, and include a short “how to rerun” note. This will make your analyses usable in real finance workflows like monthly forecasting or deal diligence.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as execution assistants. Your systematic thinking is already the career multiplier — it will let you translate messy business situations into reliable recommendations. This is a journey; each validation check and sensitivity run you add compounds into faster, more persuasive financial decisions. I’m excited to see how you apply these steps in the next project."
