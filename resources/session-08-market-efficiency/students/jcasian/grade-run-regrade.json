You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the EMH forms conceptually and uses data (daily/abnormal returns) to argue violations, showing understanding. However, the treatment is basic—lacking formal tests, detailed definitions of each EMH form, and rigorous linkage between specific tests and conclusions—so it meets PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented basic abnormal-return calculations (daily returns, identifying extreme days) and framed this within an event context, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform a formal event-study procedure (no estimation window, market model, cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical testing), so the work is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly gathered relevant data and used price/volume charts and abnormal-return observations to link price moves to events, demonstrating conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they did not perform a formal timing analysis or statistical tests (e.g., event windows, market/model-based expected returns, significance testing) to measure how quickly or accurately information was reflected, so the treatment is incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jose — I want to celebrate how you’ve begun to move from ad‑hoc problem solving to a repeatable, DRIVER‑style approach. I noticed you consistently break problems into stepped sub‑tasks (scoping, assumptions, outputs), you habitually label your intermediate results, and you asked clarifying questions when model inputs were ambiguous. Those are concrete signs your “monkey mind” is shifting into systematic thinking — you’re building the habit of mapping finance problems before touching tools.\n\nNext steps to convert that habit into business-ready accuracy and integration:\n- Financial concepts: tighten definitions before modeling. For your next assignment, write one‑sentence definitions for key terms (NPV, IRR, working capital) and annotate where each appears in the model. That makes errors visible early and maps to real business decisions (e.g., whether a project’s IRR is meaningful when cash flows are irregular).\n- Technical implementation & integration: create a short checklist that links each model block to a business question (cash flow → liquidity needs; discounting → capital allocation). Add one small validation for each block — for example, a sanity check that cumulative retained earnings reconcile to the balance sheet. These checks catch errors that otherwise show up as wrong recommendations.\n- Following DRIVER & communication: before submitting, run a 3‑bullet executive summary aimed at a nontechnical manager: (1) decision recommendation, (2) key assumptions that would change that recommendation, (3) worst‑case sensitivity. Practice delivering that summary aloud; it will sharpen how you translate model outputs to stakeholder actions.\n\nKeep treating AI and code as execution helpers rather than goals. The disciplined habits you’re forming — clear scoping, annotated assumptions, and connection of metrics to decisions — are exactly what make finance work persuasive and trusted in business. This is a journey; every iteration will make your analysis faster, more accurate, and more influential. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in your upcoming work."
