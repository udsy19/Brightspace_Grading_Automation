  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market‑efficiency testing problem and spelled out a concrete research design (time window, data types, and analysis steps), satisfying the strict requirement for clear Define & Discover articulation. While implementation had technical issues, the Define & Discover stage and the planned methodology were clearly and explicitly presented.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a systematic workflow from data identification to execution and interpretation, producing multiple outputs (tables, charts, return calculations) that align with an event‑study approach. Although some technical hiccups were reported, the implemented sequence of steps and delivered results demonstrate organized, methodical execution of the planned analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states how the empirical GME episode connects EMH concepts to behavioral finance (herding, FOMO), notes implications for mispricing and limits to arbitrage, and emphasizes verifying data—demonstrating a clear, reflective synthesis of theory and observed reality.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied data analysis to assess EMH and identified violations of weak and semi‑strong forms, showing conceptual understanding and appropriate DRIVER use. However, treatment is basic—definitions of each EMH form, discussion of strong‑form implications, and more rigorous/statistical testing are missing—so the response demonstrates correct but incomplete coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly collected data and computed daily returns and identified extreme/abnormal days, demonstrating basic application of abnormal‑return concepts. However, they did not perform a thorough event‑study (no market model/estimation window, no abnormal‑return definition or cumulative abnormal returns, no statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gathered relevant data, identified event dates, and computed abnormal returns, showing basic understanding of how to test information incorporation. However, they did not analyze timing precisely (no event‑window alignment, market‑model estimation, or statistical inference) so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jose —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve started to think like a DRIVER student. In your recent assignments you consistently broke complex problems into the D-R-I-V-E-R steps: you framed the decision context, identified relevant cash flows, and laid out assumptions before diving into computation. That habit—making assumptions explicit and isolating what matters—shows real progress in turning a “monkey mind” into systematic financial thinking. Your explanations for why certain cash flows matter in a valuation showed an improving grasp of finance logic, and your write-ups have become noticeably more structured and business-focused.\n\nFor next steps, hone three practical areas that will make your analyses immediately more useful to managers:\n- Financial concepts: tighten how you treat risk and discounting. When you choose a discount rate, state whether you’re reflecting project-specific risk or firm-wide WACC, and show how changing that assumption alters NPV and decision thresholds.\n- Technical implementation: make key calculations traceable to assumptions. For example, present a one-page sensitivity table (sales growth, margin, discount rate) that managers can scan to see break-even scenarios.\n- DRIVER fidelity: link each analysis step to a real business decision. After the valuation, explicitly state the recommended action (invest, delay, renegotiate) and the top two risks that would change that recommendation.\n\nKeep going—this is cumulative. Systematic thinking like yours becomes a career multiplier: it makes you the person executives trust to translate uncertain business questions into clear, actionable finance answers. Treat this as an iterative craft; each case you analyze will sharpen your judgment. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in your projects."
