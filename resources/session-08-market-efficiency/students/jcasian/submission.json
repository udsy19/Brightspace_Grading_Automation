  "transcript": "Hi, this is my section six. No, no, sorry, my session 8 video assignment for the section six assignment. And in this case, I'm going to use the driver framework as as good as it can get. What I will do is what I did was use a template of the driver framework that that my AI helped me to do and then filled it out which will make uh the assignment better and more easier to understand. So first of all it was my define and discover stage. Specifically in the define what I did was stated that my goal was to test whether GameStop's extreme price movements were consistent with market efficiency and also to confirm if the claim that GME which was presented here that traded at 0.04 in August 2020 was true. Then specifically to discover which is this little part right here. What I did was to identify the data I needed with real GME prices from August 2020 to February 2021. Also the trading volume, event dates and some other basic concepts like the EMH forms and behavioral biases. Then in represent I outline my plan I which is gathering the pro the data creating a price chart a volume chart calculating daily returns and also identifying abnormal returns to test market efficiency. Then to in my implement section here is my code which I will enter to Gemini that will make a Google column for the Python code. Unfortunately, this code didn't work the first time. It said that it had some errors and after trying to correct them, the AI basically stuck. Gemini basically stuck. So, what I did was I took my prompt then put it into Chajbt in order to refine it so it will actually work and it imputed this right here which will I later put into Gemini which gave me my new code. So the code f first of all is the the section of the GME data from Yahoo Finances. Then h here is the table. Oh and something important to mention is that here the head function it will show the first rows of the data set. Yeah. So here is the chart output from August 2020. Prices are around $1 and this confirms that the claim that GME traded at 0.04 in August 2020 is false. Then I plotted it plot a closing price chart. This shows the rise from around a dollar in August to the spike of almost $500 in January. Then moving on, it's the volume chart which also like in this case it plotted the trading volume. The huge spikes in January match the timeline of the short squeeze and increase retail trading activity. and finally here it calculated daily returns and printed the 10 biggest positive days. Some returns were over 100% in a single day which confirms extreme extremely abnormal returns. So after the implement we can move into the validate section which was here and in this section what I did was to interpret the results. The extreme returns and huge spikes in price and volume basically showed that the market did not behave efficiently. weak and semi strongs EMH were violated because prices did not move smoothly with information. And moving on into the evolve section here I explained that the investors should learn that behavioral forces like hering and FOMO can overpower fundamentals. Mispricing can occur and arbitrage is not always possible when risk and restrictions are high. Finally, my last stage, which is the reflection. So, what I reflected and what I learned is how EMH works in real markets and why it's important to verify the data. The GameStop events help me connect both efficiency, market theory, and behavioral finance. This was my video assignment. Thank you for watching.",
