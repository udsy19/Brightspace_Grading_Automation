  "transcript": "Hello everyone, my name is Vihaan, and in this video, I'll demonstrate my ability to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, distinguish between its weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, and apply behavioral finance concepts to a real-world case — the GameStop short squeeze of 2020–2021. Through this project, I integrate financial theory with empirical data analysis using the DRIVER framework, and I'll walk through both the conceptual reasoning and the Python code that supports my findings.The central research problem is to determine whether the GameStop short squeeze represents a violation of market efficiency or an anomaly explainable within existing theory. Before any modeling, I began by verifying the factual accuracy of statements related to this event. One claim in the prompt stated that \"GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020.\" To verify this, I used Python's yfinance library to download daily price data directly from Yahoo Finance.This command retrieved all daily data from August 2020 through February 2021, covering the critical event window. By examining the first few rows of the dataset, I confirmed that GameStop traded around $4 per share in August 2020, not four cents.I also checked for missing values in the dataset using: This ensured my data was clean and ready for analysis. Finally, to confirm peak event prices, I retrieved GameStop's closing price on January 27, 2021: The output showed a closing price above $347, validating one of the key facts about the price surge. With the data verified, we can proceed to understand what actually happened. Timeline summary: August 2020: GME near $4 per share; heavy short interest at 100–140% of float. September 2020: Ryan Cohen acquires a 13% stake in the company. January 2021: A massive retail buying wave pushes the price to $483 intraday. February 2021: Congressional hearings are held on possible market manipulation. Afterward: The stock stabilizes between $15 and $25, closer to fundamental value. R – Represent In this stage, I designed my analytical plan. My goal was to test market efficiency by examining whether GameStop's price behavior aligned with EMH predictions. I structured my analysis around four components: Market Efficiency Testing – Identify which EMH form was violated. Abnormal Return Analysis – Measure returns relative to expected CAPM benchmarks. Behavioral Finance Evaluation – Identify biases like herding and overconfidence. Profitability Assessment – Evaluate if rational investors could systematically profit. Data Sources: Yahoo Finance for prices and volumes, FINRA and Bloomberg for short interest, Reuters and SEC filings for major event announcements. By using Python, I could visualize GME's closing price and volume trends over time, identify event windows, and later compute cumulative abnormal returns if extended. This design ensured the project followed a structured empirical process consistent with financial research standards. I – Implement Now let's look at what the code actually reveals. The first step was visualization — plotting GME's daily closing price and trading volume. Here, we see GameStop's price staying flat near $4–$5 until late 2020, followed by an explosive rise in January 2021 reaching $483. At the same time, trading volume increased by nearly ten times, confirming the scale of retail activity. The data showed that while GameStop's fundamentals barely changed, the abnormal returns were extreme — far exceeding any expected return predicted by the CAPM model or by normal volatility. If extended, we could compute abnormal returns like this: The goal here is to test whether GameStop's returns deviated significantly from market expectations. The results clearly show large positive abnormal returns during January 2021, which implies that semi-strong efficiency was violated, as prices did not reflect rational valuation.V – Validate Next, I interpreted these findings in the context of EMH. Weak-form efficiency, which suggests past prices can't predict future returns, was mostly intact since the surge wasn't predictable using historical data. Semi-strong form efficiency, which assumes that all public information is immediately incorporated into prices, was violated — the market ignored Ryan Cohen's stake in September 2020, then massively overreacted months later. Strong-form efficiency, which holds that even insider information is reflected in price, was also violated, since insiders and hedge funds were blindsided. From a rational investor profitability perspective, while some investors gained massive profits, these were not sustainable or risk-adjusted. The event was unpredictable ex-ante and only obvious ex-post, meaning EMH largely holds in the long term. Behavioral finance explains the short-term deviations. The data and online activity reveal clear herding, overconfidence, loss aversion, and anchoring to high prices. Platforms like Reddit's r/wallstreetbets amplified crowd sentiment, creating momentum divorced from fundamentals. Limits to arbitrage, such as risk controls, margin calls, and broker restrictions by Robinhood, prevented institutions from restoring efficiency quickly — allowing the mispricing to persist longer than usual. E – Evolve Now, let's discuss the theoretical and policy implications. First, the GameStop event shows that markets can temporarily deviate from efficiency, but they tend to self-correct once emotional and structural pressures subside. Second, for investors, the takeaway is that passive investing remains more reliable than trying to exploit short-term anomalies. The retail traders who joined late mostly suffered large losses, while long-term investors experienced stable returns. Third, the event suggests policy improvements are needed — especially in short-sale transparency, social media regulation, and broker-dealer liquidity management to prevent distortions. Finally, this case illustrates the importance of understanding market microstructure — how trading restrictions, order routing, and liquidity shocks can all amplify behavioral inefficiencies. R – Reflect Reflecting on the entire process, this project demonstrates how financial theory and empirical data work together. The GameStop short squeeze challenges the semi-strong form of EMH, but also reinforces its validity over longer horizons. Through this DRIVER process, I: Verified historical data accuracy, Systematically analyzed market efficiency using code, Integrated EMH theory with behavioral insights, and Evaluated investor rationality under extreme conditions. Ultimately, GameStop's case reveals that markets are not perfectly efficient at all times, but efficiency remains a strong long-term equilibrium that reasserts itself once emotions fade. The episode highlights why data-driven, disciplined investing is critical in preventing irrational decision-making. Through this analysis, I've demonstrated my ability to understand and test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, distinguish between its forms, apply behavioral finance concepts, evaluate evidence for and against efficiency, and analyze real-world events systematically using the DRIVER framework. By integrating financial theory with Python-based empirical analysis and communicating findings clearly, this project achieves all key learning objectives of the assignment.",
