  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them to the GameStop event with empirical support (abnormal returns, timeline, ignored public info). Their DRIVER plan, data implementation, and validation stages provide a coherent, in-depth treatment meeting the threshold for thorough conceptual understanding.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem and states clear goals in the Discover stage, then translates that into a concrete Represent plan identifying EMH forms to test. This explicit framing and planning satisfies the strict DRIVER requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit Represent stage: a concrete analytical plan with components, data sources, and intended technical actions (event windows, CAR computation). This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit Represent/plan rather than an implied approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal-return testing and the CAPM benchmark and implements data collection and visualization, demonstrating conceptual understanding (R and I). However, they do not present a completed event-study methodology (estimation window, market/model specification, CAR computation, or statistical significance testing) — only noting that abnormal returns could be computed — so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and cites concrete timeline examples (Ryan Cohen stake, January surge) and mechanisms (volume, limits to arbitrage) showing delayed/imperfect information incorporation. However, the treatment is qualitative and lacks explicit event-study timing/statistical analysis (estimation windows, immediate abnormal-return tests), so the evaluation is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student collected data and described an intended abnormal-return methodology, but did not actually execute or demonstrate abnormal return calculations (no code output, formulas, estimation window, CAR, or significance testing). Under the strict technical standard requiring explicit personal execution and block-level demonstration, the evidence is insufficient.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Vihaan — I want to celebrate how you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a predictable, repeatable approach. You consistently applied the DRIVER structure: you define the decision clearly, isolate key value drivers, and laid out assumptions before computing outcomes. Your written explanations were crisp — when you walked through the cash-flow mechanics and the sensitivity logic, I could see the mental model you’re using. That kind of clarity is exactly what turns “monkey mind” into disciplined financial thinking.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on tightening a few technical and conceptual linkages so your models map even more closely to real business decisions. Specifically:\n- Reconcile accounting movements (depreciation, working capital changes, tax timing) with the cash flows you project; run a waterfall that explains how net income becomes free cash flow in three lines. This matters for valuation and capital budgeting conversations in firms.\n- Add structured stress tests: build a small scenario table that varies revenue growth, margin, and capex — then translate the impact to liquidity and covenant risk. That’s the kind of output CFOs use to judge feasibility.\n- When you use heuristics, annotate why you chose them (industry benchmarks, management guidance). That makes your assumptions defensible in stakeholder discussions like M&A or forecasting.\n\nKeep leaning into systematic thinking. The rigor you’re building is a career multiplier — it makes your analyses repeatable, explainable, and persuasive under pressure. Treat today’s feedback as roadmap checkpoints; I’m excited to see how you apply these refinements in your next case. You’re on a strong trajectory — keep iterating."
