  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly represents the CAPM framework, walks through each code cell's function (block-by-block), and interprets the resulting plots, demonstrating personal execution and understanding despite noting AI assistance. This satisfies the strict requirements for technical implementation and ownership, so the criterion is passed.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the research problem and explicitly describes the design choices (question, framework, data sources, time window, and planned AR/CAR analysis), meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. These concrete decisions would allow a reviewer to understand and reproduce the study's initial research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly specifies a clear, reproducible representational framework (CAPM-style expected returns, benchmark choice, beta decision) and narrates the cell-by-cell implementation, demonstrating ownership and executable research design. These concrete choices and explanations satisfy the strict requirements for the Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual understanding of semi-strong EMH and applies empirical analysis to test it (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT), but the submission addresses only the semi-strong form and does not discuss or compare the weak and strong forms or provide broader, detailed treatment of all EMH forms. Under the moderate standard, this yields a partial rather than full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements the basic event-study steps (market benchmark, returns, abnormal returns, CAR) and documents code workflow (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT), but treatment is simplified and incomplete—e.g., beta is fixed at 1, no estimation window or statistical inference and limited robustness checks—so the work shows correct methodology at a basic level but lacks the thoroughness required for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and applies a basic event-study approach (ARs and CARs) and draws a conclusion about information not being fully incorporated, showing conceptual understanding (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT). However, the treatment is simplified and incomplete—no explicit timing/market-adjustment analysis, estimation window, statistical tests, or robustness checks—so it demonstrates the concept but lacks the thoroughness required for a full pass.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Andrew —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a more disciplined, DRIVER-style approach. In particular, your ability to translate a fuzzy business question into a reproducible workflow and to execute the technical implementation shows you’re thinking like a systematic practitioner. The way you structured inputs and produced repeatable outputs demonstrates the core habit we aim for: turning “monkey mind” reactions into defendable steps.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Tighten financial concept accuracy: for each model output, add a one-paragraph economic rationale — why a change in X moves Y — and reconcile key formulas (e.g., discounting, working capital drivers) to a company P&L and balance sheet. This will make your numbers narratively credible to finance stakeholders.\n- Improve integration of finance and technology: map each code block or module to a specific business decision (pricing, investment, capital structure). Then run simple sensitivity scenarios that tie to KPIs (EBITDA, free cash flow) so non-technical stakeholders can see decision trade-offs.\n- Follow DRIVER more precisely in presentations: begin with Decision, list high-leverage Inputs and key Risks, show core Evidence, and end with Recommended action and how to operationalize it. Use a one-slide CFO summary that answers “what I should do differently” in plain business terms.\n- Communicate clearly: practice converting a technical chart into a single-sentence takeaway plus one action. That habit turns analysis into influence.\n\nKeep treating this as a craft. The systematic thinking you’re building is the most valuable asset you’ll carry into any finance role — it makes complex problems teachable, repeatable, and defensible. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps to real business cases; you’re on a genuine trajectory."
