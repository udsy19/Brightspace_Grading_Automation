  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes and walks through the event-study implementation step-by-step (cells for data, returns, AR, CAR, plots), states the formula used for abnormal returns, and reports verifying results, demonstrating personal execution and block-level understanding. AI assistance is disclosed but the student shows clear ownership and validation of the calculations, satisfying the strict implementation requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem (semi-strong EMH for the GME squeeze) and states the DRIVER-based plan to compute abnormal returns, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. The subsequent representation and implementation steps confirm the defined problem was operationalized.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states a concrete analytical plan (CAPM-based expected return, AR and CAR definitions) and then walks through the stepwise implementation, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The representation is clear, actionable, and directly linked to implementation, so it meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the semi-strong EMH test using abnormal returns/CAR and articulates the implication that public information alone doesn't explain the GME spike (Demonstrated via Discover/Implement/Reflect). However, the submission only addresses semi-strong efficiency and does not define or discuss the weak and strong forms or compare them, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission correctly implements core event-study steps (data download, return calculation, abnormal returns, CAR) and interprets results, showing conceptual competence. However, the methodology is basic (beta arbitrarily set to 1, no beta estimation/estimation window, no significance testing or robustness checks), so the treatment is correct but incomplete and thus rates as PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied core event-study elements and interpreted large abnormal returns as evidence that public information did not fully explain price moves, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic—beta was set arbitrarily, there is no estimation window, timing/velocity of incorporation and statistical significance tests are not addressed—so the evaluation of information incorporation is incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Andrew — I’m genuinely pleased with how you’ve shifted from scattered problem-solving to a clear, repeatable approach. Your technical implementation was solid: you translated business questions into executable steps, used AI as an assistant rather than a crutch, and treated code as a guardrail to enforce logic. That discipline shows real movement toward the DRIVER mindset — I can see your “monkey mind” becoming a systematic thinker who maps problems to data and decision rules.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: tighten a few finance concepts and their business implications. When you model cash flows or valuation, explicitly link each assumption to a real driver (e.g., revenue per customer, churn rate, margin by product). Practice writing one-sentence financial hypotheses before you code — this forces clarity on cause-and-effect. For integrating finance and technology, prototype a small dashboard that connects a raw data table to a KPI and a decision rule (for example, when burn rate > threshold then trigger scenario plan). That concrete artifact helps bridge conceptual accuracy and technical execution. In following DRIVER more closely, formalize the five steps in a one-page rubric for each assignment so you don’t skip the “Interpret” and “Risk” stages. For communication, keep using plain-language executive summaries (3 bullets: insight, recommendation, uncertainty) aimed at a CFO.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that will pay dividends in any finance role: systematic thinking makes you faster, more defensible, and promotable. Treat this as ongoing refinement — each project is another opportunity to tighten assumptions, test rules, and influence business decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this."
