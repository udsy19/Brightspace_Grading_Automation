  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and comprehensively defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and links each to practical implications (technical, fundamental, insider trading). They applied the concept via an event-study simulation and described validation steps (timing of abnormal returns, significance, persistence), demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes event-study methodology (event windows, CAPM-based expected returns, AR = actual − expected) and implemented it in code, then discussed appropriate validation steps (statistical, economic, persistence). This combination of conceptual explanation, applied simulation, and robustness checks demonstrates a thorough, practical understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the speed/accuracy expectation under semi-strong EMH, implemented an event-study simulation that measures immediate vs. delayed reactions (efficient ratio and post-event drift), and described appropriate validation checks. This combination of conceptual framing, applied simulation, and robustness discussion demonstrates a thorough understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key behavioral biases and links them to empirical anomalies (e.g., momentum, post‑earnings drift) and models this via a simulation. However, treatment is high-level—biases are listed and connected to drift but not explored in depth or with specific mechanisms/examples for each bias—so the work shows correct understanding but is not thoroughly detailed, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key anomalies (momentum, value, size) and models post‑earnings drift with a simulation, plus mentions persistence checks—showing understanding beyond mere mention. However, treatment is high‑level and focused on an event‑study/drift example; cross‑sectional tests, calendar anomalies, and deeper quantitative/mechanistic discussion are missing, so the work warrants PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the CAPM-based AR formula, implemented and ran a simulation, and described how beta is used to compute normal returns—showing practical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanations or detailed ownership of each function/step (only a high‑level walkthrough), so the demonstration is correct but not explicit enough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Andrea —\n\nI’m genuinely pleased by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You moved quickly from an ad-hoc approach to a repeatable process: you consistently decomposed problems into drivers, stated assumptions explicitly, and built logic guardrails that prevent cascading errors. I noticed concrete strengths — your scenario breakdowns tied model inputs to business levers (price, volume, margin) in a way that made trade-offs visible, and you used AI to accelerate execution while keeping final judgment clearly yours. Those are exactly the shifts that turn “monkey mind” work into systematic financial thinking.\n\nFor next steps, focus two practical improvements that will make your work more actionable for business leaders. First, tighten communication: accompany models with a one-page executive memo that states the key assumptions, the top three drivers that move the outcome, and the recommended decision rule (e.g., “invest if NPV > X under base and best-case”). Second, strengthen the remaining technical touchpoint you’ve been developing — run and present a sensitivity matrix (tornado chart + break-even points) that links small input changes to financial outcomes. In business settings, these two artifacts (concise memo + sensitivity matrix) turn analysis into decision-ready insight for CFOs and product leaders.\n\nKeep thinking of this as a journey. The habits you’re building — decomposing problems, applying logic guardrails, and translating outputs into decisions — are career multipliers in finance. Continue iterating: each model you make is practice in clear thinking that will pay off on real investment committees and strategic reviews. If you want, bring your next model to office hours and we’ll work through the memo and sensitivity layout together.\n\nWarmly,\nProfessor Zhang"
