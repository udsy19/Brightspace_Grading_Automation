  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research problem, laid out the DRIVER research design steps, and demonstrated personal execution (data download, scripted verification, and basic analysis) — satisfying the strict requirement for Define & Discover. The design and initial verification are clearly stated and defensible, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, stepwise DRIVER plan (define/discover → represent → implement → validate → evolve), produced multiple outputs (stat table, daily-return calculations, event chart with a fundamental-value band), and validated inputs, demonstrating systematic execution of an event-study-style methodology. While more advanced tests (abnormal-return models/statistics) were not performed, the implemented workflow meets the criterion for systematic implementation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed external validation (Yahoo Finance and assignment data), compared key data points (lowest price, peak $483), and corrected errors, satisfying the requirement for external validation. While formal statistical significance tests or extensive robustness checks were not performed, the moderate validate standard (external comparison) is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and argues a semi-strong form violation with supporting data and visual analysis, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not discuss the weak and strong forms of EMH or provide comparable analysis/examples for them, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly performed data collection, computed daily returns, and produced a visual \"proxy\" event analysis, showing conceptual awareness of event-study goals. However, they did not perform formal abnormal-return calculations (benchmark/model specification, estimation window, cumulative abnormal returns, or significance testing), so the methodology is correct in intent but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses and illustrates qualitative examples of information incorporation (reaction to Ryan Cohen vs. the January short squeeze) and implemented daily-return visuals to observe price response. However, they did not perform formal timing or accuracy tests (no event-window abnormal-return calculations, benchmarks, or statistical significance), so the treatment is conceptually sound but methodologically incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Caden — I’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You consistently break problems into Drivers, Inputs, Variables, Expectations, and Results: your assumptions are explicit, your scenario branches are clean, and your outputs map back to the original business question. That systematic scaffolding made your cash-flow scenarios easy to follow and showed clear causal thinking — exactly the transformation from “monkey mind” reaction to structured analysis I want to see.\n\nFor next steps, let’s tighten one specific technical area so your models are more robust in real business settings. Build simple validation checks and edge-case tests for your inputs (e.g., negative growth, missing forecasts, outlier capex) and add a short “assumptions audit” block that flags improbable values. Practically, this improves financial forecasting, valuation sensitivity, and risk reporting: when you hand a model to a manager or investor, they’ll immediately see both the logic and the safety nets. Also deepen the finance–tech integration you’ve started — for example, create a small scenario library (best/base/worst) and automate toggling between them so comparative metrics (IRR, NPV, breakeven) update reliably.\n\nKeep treating code as a logic guardrail, not the goal. The real value is your ability to translate business questions into repeatable, testable analyses. Maintain curiosity: iterate on your assumptions, stress-test outcomes, and document why a number moves when a driver changes. This is a career-defining skill — systematic thinking compounds over projects and roles. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
