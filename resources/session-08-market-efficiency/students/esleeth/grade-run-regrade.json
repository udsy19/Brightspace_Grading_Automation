  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, applied understanding of EMH forms: they clearly distinguish the forms, design and execute an event-study (CAPM, abnormal returns, t-test) to test semi-strong efficiency, and interpret implications for weak and strong forms. The combination of Discover (question), Implement (empirical methods), and Reflect (interpretation) shows comprehensive treatment beyond a basic mention, meriting PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student implemented a full event-study workflow (market beta estimation via CAPM, abnormal/CAR calculation, and statistical testing) and interpreted the results, demonstrating applied understanding of event-study methodology. While granular procedural details (estimation window, significance levels) are not narrated, the implemented steps and interpretation satisfy the moderate standard for a thorough, applied treatment, so PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, stated the research objective, and described the data and event window to be used, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration. This level of clarity and planning supports a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented an event-study and concluded that prices \"didn't immediately reflect\" public information, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, treatment of \"how quickly\" is limited (no detailed timing, event-window specifics, significance levels, or robustness checks reported), so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly planned and reported implementing abnormal-return calculations (CAPM, abnormal/CAR series) and a t-test, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT requirement there is insufficient explicit personal verification, block-by-block explanation, or detailed methodological specifics (estimation window, code walkthrough, ownership of runs), so the work is correct but not fully demonstrated for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student correctly defines and implements abnormal-return calculations (CAPM expected returns, AR/CAR series, t-test) and interprets results in context, demonstrating conceptual and applied understanding. However, the explanation lacks detailed methodological specifics (formulas, estimation window, parameter choices, numeric results or robustness checks), so the treatment is accurate but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Evan — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. Your work consistently isolates the core drivers, maps causal chains, and uses that logic to structure financial decisions. I noticed especially how you translated customer acquisition assumptions into unit economics and then tied those units through to cash flow — that system-level clarity is exactly what turns “monkey mind” guesses into defensible business judgment. Your models read like a decision narrative, not a jumble of inputs, which is a hard and valuable habit to build.\n\nFor the next leg of the journey, focus on two practical steps that will make your thinking even more actionable for business leaders. First, tighten technical implementation into an end-to-end financial story: formalize assumptions in one driver table, link them to the three financial statements, and add a simple scenario matrix (best/base/worst) so you can show how specific driver shifts change runway, breakeven, and cash needs. Second, deepen integration between finance and ops: pick a real KPI (e.g., CAC payback or contribution margin by cohort), build a short sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo around it, and summarize the business implications in two lines — what would you recommend the ops team do if that KPI moves by 10–20%?\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails that enforce your logic, and practice presenting your driver-based story to a nontechnical stakeholder (CFO/CEO role-play). That presentation practice will hone the crisp, decision-focused recommendations that leaders need.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that turns systematic thinking into real influence. Stay curious, iterate quickly, and treat every model as a conversation starter with the business — not the final answer. I’m excited to see where you take this."
