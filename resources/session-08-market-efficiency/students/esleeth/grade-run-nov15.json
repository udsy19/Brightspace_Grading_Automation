  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency question and a concrete research design (data, benchmark, model, event window, and statistical test), satisfying strict requirements for Define & Discover. The plan is specific and defensible, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a coherent, repeatable event-study workflow and produced multiple analytical outputs (AR/CAR series, statistical test, visualizations), demonstrating systematic implementation of the methodology. While some methodological details could be expanded, the implemented process meets the criterion for systematic execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student named a specific external data source (Yahoo Finance) and used it to verify an external claim (the 4-cent price), fulfilling the requirement to compare outputs to an external source. They also applied a formal significance test (t-test) to validate results, so the Validate criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies an event-study approach (CAPM, abnormal returns, t-test) to evaluate semi-strong efficiency, showing applied understanding (Implement + Discover). However, the treatment is uneven: claims about weak-form and strong-form outcomes are asserted with limited supporting detail or evidence (e.g., minimal justification for weak-form violation and only a tentative claim about insiders for strong form). This warrants PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, standard event-study steps conceptually (data, beta/CAPM, abnormal/CAR, t-test), showing applied understanding (Discover + Implement). However, the submission lacks important methodological detail and robustness (estimation window/model specification, exact event-window choice, adjustments or diagnostics), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual and methodological steps for testing information incorporation (event study, CARs, t-test) and concludes semi-strong inefficiency, but the treatment is basic and lacks critical detail (estimation/event-window choices, timing/granularity, robustness or controls). Therefore the understanding is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Evan — I’ve been impressed by how you’ve shifted from ad-hoc problem solving to a repeatable, DRIVER-style approach. You consistently frame problems before jumping in, make your assumptions explicit, and your write-ups now walk a reader through logic rather than just outputs. That clarity — especially in linking model inputs to business levers — is a real strength. Your use of AI as an execution assistant (prompting for alternative scenarios and summarizing results) shows growing maturity in delegating routine work and focusing on judgment.\n\nFor next steps, target the remaining conceptual rough spot and the technical implementation gap as complementary opportunities rather than separate failures. Practically:\n- Pick the one financial concept that was shaky and tie it to a live business decision (for example, if it’s discounting or cost of capital, re-run a small NPV case for a product launch). Document the link from operational assumptions (sales ramp, margins) to the finance metric and stress-test those assumptions with a 3-scenario sensitivity table.\n- For the technical implementation issue, focus on a short “verification” loop: convert your result into a simple back-of-envelope check and a sanity plot. If numbers diverge, trace which assumption changes cause the largest swings.\n- Strengthen the DRIVER steps you’re still refining by writing a one-paragraph “Decision Memo” that ends with a recommended action and the top two risks and mitigations.\n\nYou’re building a durable decision-making muscle that companies crave: the ability to translate messy business questions into reproducible, explainable finance answers. Keep iterating — treat each project as a calibration exercise — and you’ll keep turning that systematic thinking into strategic impact. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
