  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states EMH predictions, implements appropriate empirical tests (abnormal returns, event windows, volume) and uses specific evidence to evaluate weak and semi-strong forms, meeting the requirement for a thorough, applied treatment. Their analysis links conceptual definitions to concrete results and robustness checks, demonstrating strong conceptual mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly operationalized an event-study: collected market data, defined events, computed market-adjusted abnormal returns, compared event and non-event windows, and checked robustness. These steps and the validation discussion demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology appropriate for the assignment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly stated the EMH benchmark for speed of information incorporation, implemented an event-study-style test (market-adjusted abnormal returns and event vs. non-event comparison), and found abnormal returns persisting for several days with no clear public information—demonstrating a thorough, applied evaluation of how quickly and accurately markets reflected new information.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and executed abnormal-return calculations (market-adjusted returns, event vs. non-event summaries) and showed personal debugging/validation, satisfying basic technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not provide block-by-block code explanations or detailed function-level ownership in the transcript, so the demonstration is correct but incomplete.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly states core EMH predictions and applies them to the GME event, showing conceptual understanding and relevant application. However, the treatment is brief and omits deeper discussion (e.g., assumptions, strong-form coverage, statistical testing details), so it demonstrates a correct but not thoroughly comprehensive explanation.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Dhyana — I’ve really enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation. You’ve moved from intuiting finance to applying it with disciplined logic: your cash-flow breakdowns and cost-of-capital reasoning were consistently precise, your scenario tables showed a clear grasp of risk/return tradeoffs, and you integrated finance with technology sensibly (using tools to surface insights, not to hide assumptions). Most impressive was how you followed the DRIVER steps—your problem framing, stated assumptions, and sensitivity analysis turned “monkey mind” guesses into repeatable decision rules. That systematic habit will pay immediate dividends in any finance role.\n\nFor next steps, treat technical implementation as the bridge between clean thinking and business impact. Practical actions:\n- Turn your models into modular templates: separate assumptions, calculations, and outputs so a CFO can update a single cell and see enterprise-level impacts.\n- Add explicit decision triggers (e.g., if NPV < threshold, then delay project) so model outputs map directly to business actions.\n- Build simple stress-test scenarios tied to real drivers (revenues by channel, supplier disruptions) and summarize the business implications in one-page memos.\n- Use AI as an execution assistant: prompt it to produce model-checklists, sensitivity plots, or draft executive summaries you then validate.\n\nThese aren’t coding chores; they’re how you make finance usable and persuasive to stakeholders. Keep iterating—each practical template, memo, or decision rule you create reinforces systematic thinking and shortens the path from analysis to action. I’m excited to see how you translate this rigor into strategic influence—think of this as a professional craft you refine project by project. If you want, bring one of your templates to office hours and we’ll sharpen the decision triggers together."
