  "transcript": "Hey, my name is Diana and this is my session 8 driver analysis. So my main question for this project is did GameStop price behavior during 2020 to 2021 short squeeze follow the efficient market hypothesis or did the market behave inefficient? So to analyze this, I looked at price reactions, abnormal returns, um volume and behavioral patterns. So the prompt claimed that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. And I verified the historical data myself and this was incorrect. Um GME traded and $2 in August of 2020. Um, so correcting this was important before starting the analysis. So here I just showed how I verified that on Yahoo Finance. Um, I chose the correct time period, historical prices, monthly, and then you can see the closing price here is $167 um on August 1. That's the I decided to use for the analysis. Um here is the event timeline I used. So in 2020 um uh GME was distressed and then December of 2020 Ryan Cohen increased his stake. And then Jan 2021, Reddit refueled short squeeze um pushing price near $483. And then in February of 2021, there's the congressional hearings. So this helped me compare the timing of price reactions to the AMH predictions. These key facts shaped uh the squeeze here. So first is um 140% short interest. Um then we have massive retail trading volume. We have broker buying restrictions. Hedge fund losses around 50%. um and analysts valuing the stock around $10 to $40 per share. And I got these from these websites. I have the sources listed here. Um and this helps to with the evaluation of like whether the prices reflected real information. So in the represent stage, I mapped out my steps. So that involved verifying the price data, um collecting the GME and SPY data, um marking event dates, calculating returns and abnormal returns, um and analyzing graphs and results using EMH and behavioral finance. So here im EMH predicts that prices should react quickly to information, abnormal returns should disappear fast and prices should stay close to fundamental value. And I plan to compare these to how Jimmy actually uh behaved. And as a part of represent I kind of walked through my Python workflow. So downloading data, calculating daily abnormal returns, um marking event dates, plotting price, etc. So I have this all listed here and here is the AI prompt that I put into chatbt to get my Python for the financial analysis which outlines what I have listed here. So now let's go ahead and do the code analysis. So at a high level um this code is basically so first it downloads GME and spy data from Y finance. Um then it calculates daily returns for both um and computes abnormal returns as GME return minus market return. Um and then it defines the key event dates from the timeline and then generates three different graphs. the price chart, the abnormal uh returns chart, and then the volume chart. And then it'll also output uh summary statistics comparing the event window to the non-event window. And this is the output here that we can walk through. So first is the summary statistics. Um these show how unusual GME was. So the event window normal return averaged here it says 14.4% compared to only 2% normally. Um and some days saw abnormal returns over here is 137% which is extremely rare. Um and then volume jumped around um 59 million to 338 million. So almost six times higher which is pretty significant. Excuse me. So these numbers show that GME's movements were far outside of normal market behavior based on what we know. So next is uh the GME price graph. Uh it's kind of covered by this text here, but this graph shows the price spike pretty clearly. Um the price shoots up dramatically in late January, so right before Feb 2021 here and then collapses shortly after. There is no no new information strong enough to justify this move. So this suggests strong behavioral influence rather than efficient pricing. Then here we have the abnormal returns graph. Um and in an efficient market abnormal returns should fade quickly. And here abnormal returns stay extremely high across um several days which is a sign of momentum trading and hurting behavior. So this is inconsistent with the semi strong EMH. And then finally we have the volume graph. Uh the trading volume explodes during the squeeze period. um volume spikes like this often signal attention hype or like social mediadriven behavior rather than um fundamental value changes. So this kind of it supports the behavioral explanation. Um so here in the validate stage I checked whether my results were reliable. So the robustness of findings um and the abnormal returns and volume spikes were large enough to be economically meaningful. Um so these weren't random one day jumps. They persisted across several days. Um no major public information explains the spike which suggests behavioral factors. Um, and the event window looks very different from the normal period, suggesting the idea that this was really a a real anomaly. So together, these checks confirm that my findings are strong and trustworthy. So overall, this showed me that markets are equally efficient. Um where when there's hype or social media tension um prices can move away from the fundamentals. Um and then here in future analysis uh I'll watch for signals like big um abnormal returns volume surges um and online attention trends. And for investing, passive strategies work in stable periods but in unusual situations like GME, but behavioral factors matter more here. So overall, the conclusion is that GME showed that markets are mostly efficient but can break down under extreme behavioral pressures. And on everything. My biggest surprise was to see how extreme the volume spike was. Um, as far as the hardest part, it was definitely fixing the code, the data uh process properly. I haven't had issues with the code not running in the past. So, I had to do a little bit of like um trial and error to um figure out what code works best. There was an issue with the adjust adjusted close column that I had to fix. And then as far as the easiest part, it was definitely um what was easier than expected was interpreting the graphs once they displayed uh because the patterns were pretty clear. And next time I'd give more time to the interpretation stage of the outputs since it ended up being like the most important and timeconsuming part. So to conclude my analysis, um semi- strong efficiency was violated because prices did not respond rationally to information and weak form efficiency was partly violated due to momentum like patterns. Um and then for price behavior um it was driven by hype and overconfidence, FOMO, um hurting um and rational traders couldn't correct the price because of high risk and trading restrictions. And before the event, there was no predictable profit opportunity. and after the fact some traders profited but not in the way that indicates efficiency. In the end um the GME squeeze shows that markets are generally efficient during normal periods but can temporarily break when behavioral forces and trading frictions combine. So, this case helped me understand both EMH and behavioral finance and how they work together in uh real markets. All right. Thank you.",
