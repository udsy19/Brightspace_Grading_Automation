  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and applied them to the GameStop episode, supported by empirical implementation (data pull and abnormal-return calculations) and interpretation of results and market factors. Coverage includes definitions, empirical application, and plausible explanations for the anomaly, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student accurately defines EMH forms, identifies behavioral drivers (herding/social media) tied to the GameStop anomaly, and explicitly synthesizes theory and practice by recommending EMH for long‑term framing and behavioral finance for short‑term anomalies. This demonstrates a clear, well‑reasoned integration satisfying the Reflect stage.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student clearly defines weak/semi‑strong/strong EMH, applies those ideas to the GameStop event with empirical abnormal‑return analysis, and draws practical implications (timing, active vs passive management, policy). Coverage is specific, applied, and synthesized, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented the core abnormal-return calculation (actual minus expected using CAPM) and produced empirical results, demonstrating conceptual and practical engagement. However, they did not show full event-study rigor (no clear event/estimation window specification, no cumulative abnormal returns or statistical significance testing, and limited methodological detail), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described the concept that markets should incorporate public/private information and implemented an empirical abnormal‑return calculation showing large deviations. However, they did not analyze the speed of incorporation explicitly (no event/estimation window, reaction timeline, or statistical timing tests), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified herding/social-media influence and linked behavioral bias to empirical abnormal returns, showing conceptual and empirical connection. However, treatment is limited—other specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly analyzed or illustrated in depth—so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Luke — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to a clear, repeatable approach. You consistently broke problems into DRIVER-style steps (define objective, identify drivers, run experiments, evaluate results, repeat) and your write-ups showed concrete decomposition: isolating revenue drivers, stating assumptions, and tracing how each input flowed to the final metric. That systematic thinking — treating finance problems as a chain of causal logic rather than a hunch — is exactly the transformation I expect from this course.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your work: focus on a couple of targeted computational-thinking practices that will pay immediate business dividends. First, make your assumptions and sensitivity checks explicit for stakeholders — e.g., present 3 scenarios (base/higher/lower growth), show the impact on cash flow and a simple NPV or payback metric, and annotate which inputs change decision thresholds. Second, strengthen your technical implementation by treating models as decision tools: add short validity checks (reasonable ranges, sign checks), document the business rule behind each formula, and include one stress test that could flip the recommendation. These are not coding tricks — they are guardrails that make your analysis defensible in meetings with finance partners.\n\nKeep going. The ability to turn messy business questions into disciplined, testable models will set you apart in corporate finance, strategy, or investing roles. This is a journey: each clear assumption, each sensitivity table, and each annotated result builds trust and accelerates better decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this next — keep using DRIVER as your map, and keep pushing the analysis until it convinces both you and the business."
