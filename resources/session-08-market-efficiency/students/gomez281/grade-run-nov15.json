  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency question and presented a clear, stepwise research design (planned analyses and data sources) and then executed and validated initial facts, satisfying the DRIVER Define & Discover requirements. The documentation of planned methods and the performed verification provide the explicit demonstration required under the strict standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, stepwise research design for event-based efficiency testing and explicitly documented planned methods, then executed and validated key elements (data download, event-window comparisons). This meets the strict requirement for an explicit, defensible Represent framework suitable for analysis and review.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed an explicit, organized event-study procedure: planned methods, executed data download/code, produced visual outputs and event-window metrics, and validated key facts. This demonstrates systematic implementation of the event-study methodology consistent with the DRIVER Implement requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined all three EMH forms and performed multiple data-driven analyses (price/volume charts, abnormal returns, event windows, benchmark comparison) that convincingly apply to the semi-strong form. However, treatment of the weak and strong forms is limited to brief definitions with little application or deeper discussion, so the work shows solid but not fully comprehensive mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performed event-study style analyses (event windows, pre/post average returns, lists of extreme daily returns and benchmark comparison), demonstrating correct basic application. However, they did not present key methodological details (expected-return model, estimation window, abnormal return definition/CAR calculation, or statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-window comparisons and interpreted pre/post return patterns to assess how markets reflected new public information, showing conceptual understanding and data-driven application. However, the treatment omitted formal abnormal-return construction, estimation-window/market-model specification, and statistical inference, so the analysis is sound but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tomas —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted from scattered instincts to a repeatable, DRIVER-style process. In recent assignments you consistently exposed your assumptions up front, walked through the decision logic for valuation choices, and tied model outputs back to business questions (for example, your scenario that linked margin sensitivity to working-capital needs was a concrete, systematic move). Those are exactly the habits that turn “monkey mind” analysis into reliable financial judgment.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on two practical areas that will multiply that progress:\n- Tighten technical implementation as a logic guardrail. When you translate an assumption into a model step, add a short sanity check (e.g., a one-line validation that growth rates are within plausible bounds, or that cash flow signs match expectations). In business settings this prevents misleading forecasts and makes your decks instantly more credible to stakeholders.\n- Follow the DRIVER checklist explicitly on every deliverable. Before you finalize a recommendation, run through: Decisions (what decision must be made), Inputs (which numbers drive it), Variables (what we can change), Evidence (what supports assumptions), Results (sensitivity and implications). Making that checklist visible in your memo or slide notes will sharpen presentations and accelerate buy-in from finance and non-finance partners.\n\nKeep treating the framework as an iterative discipline. Systematic thinking will make you faster and more persuasive in real finance roles — whether you’re defending a capex request, building a forecast for investor meetings, or stress-testing a business model. This is a journey; your current momentum shows you’re on the right path. I’m excited to see how you apply these guardrails to higher-stakes problems next. Keep pushing the rigor; the payoff will be tangible in your career."
