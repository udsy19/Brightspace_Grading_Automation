  "transcript": "Hi Dr. Zhang, how are you? My name is Tomas Gomez and this is my session eight assignment for the market efficiency investigation. Okay, so for this assignment we are uh going over the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. And basically what we're trying to understand is if the GME meaning GameStop situation behave the way efficient market the efficient market hypothesis or the EMH says a stock uh should behave. So our job for this assignment is to verify the facts to analyze price behavior to compare it to EMH predictions. uh to decide if the anomalies truly break EMH or if EMH can still explain them with real world limitations and also evaluate whether a rational investor could have made systematic profit uh out of this event. Okay. So first uh obviously we have to go over some some of the important terms. Uh first the efficient market hypothesis or EMH. It says that prices reflect information efficiently. So you can't consistently beat the market and it has three forms. The weak form of EMH which reflects all past price data. the semi- strong form of EMH which prices reflect all public information and the strong form of EMH where prices reflect all information including insider information. Uh here GME mainly challenges the semi strong form of EMH. First obviously we have to go over uh all of the terms and what is uh the information that we are given. This is obviously the define and discover or the D stage in our driver analysis as we can see here in our driver analysis document. uh the defined stage we know what our objective is and the critical initial question which states that GME traded at zero at 4 cents in August 2020. Um because this value appears suspiciously low uh I obviously need to verify it. So I went and verified the value and we'll obviously talk more about this later but uh it's not true. It's not true. GME did not trade at 4 cents in August 2020. It was a bit higher than that. And as we can see here as I go over in the document some other key concepts that we need to understand uh before the analysis is the short interest which is the percentage of sale of shares sold short which is more than 100% which indicates extreme crowding and creates conditions for a squeeze such as a GME. Then this short squeeze which is a rapid price increase caused by short sellers forced to buy shares back and abnormal returns which are daily returns uh far be typ far beyond typical market movements. Um, also here in the information that we're given, uh, the timeline, it's just, I mean, it's not really key each of these events, but we still have to go over them. In August 2020, GME is near bankruptcy levels. Uh, then in September 2020, Ryan Cohen, who is a Chewy founder, acquires 13% stake of Gamestock share. uh which this one is important to know which is this is positive public information. Then in January 2021, Wall Street Bets uh drives price surge to a high of $483. So a nonfundament nonfunddamental price explosion. Then in February 2021, there are congressional hearings on the market manipulation uh which says that trading restrictions and hearings create the market a a market structure shock. And then we have other key data points that we have to go over before actually starting the the analysis is that the short interest peaked at 100% off float which means that more shares were sold than actually existed. Uh which is exactly the setup where the short squeeze becomes mechanically possible. Uh of course EMH doesn't naturally predict this kind of structural imbalance. Then here that is a t-fold retail volume spike shows a lot of behavioral forces uh behavioral forces such as hurting uh fear of missing out and narrative driven training which is helpful for expl for explaining price behavior outside the fundamentals. Again connecting to the efficient market market hypothesis there were trading restrictions implemented at the peak by Robin Hood um which is that uh I mean I'm me personally I'm interested in the topic and I watched uh the movie about this uh a couple couple months ago and Robin Hood deactivated the sell button for uh the GME talk right when it was at its peak. So there were trading restrictions implemented and then they went to court for that. Well, it was this whole thing. Uh but this means that prices during restriction periods cannot cannot be analyzed as free market prices because there were restrictions. Uh we know that hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 53% losses requiring a bailout which shows limits to arbitrage. Even even professionals can always correct mispricing and this concept is directly relevant to the semi-rong form and the strong form of EMH. And then analyst fundamental value estimates $10 to $40 per share is kind of a benchmark. Uh comparing this range to the price spikes helps us evaluate irrational price movement and whether any portion of the surge reflects real business prospects. Okay. So, um, after I went over all of this information in my driver document right here, then I went onto the represent stage, uh, and I just planned out what I was going to do before the implement stage. Uh uh first some fact verification. Download the GME historical data. Print the data in the August 2020 prices. Uh confirm whether the 4 cent claim is accurate. Then price and volume visualization. A daily returns analysis, event window analysis, uh benchmarking and trading strategy examples. uh I just planned out everything I was going to do right here in the document before actually implementing it. Then once I knew what I needed, I went over here to uh Google Gemini and I uh gave it a this pretty long prompt because we I I wanted to go in deep in detail and in depth. So I gave it a prompt uh to write a Python code uh completing all of the information that I know I needed and at the end this is uh the code in code app that it gave me here just obviously uh goes all over the code and then the the response uh starts here. The first thing we can see is the step one uh GME uh download and verification. Uh the code downloaded uh the data of the stock prices for Gamestock uh on August to verify if it was actually worth $0.04. 04 on August. And here we can see that it is not true. It's not true. Um this this top panel shows the first couple days of of the of the of the month. uh the close price, the high price, the low price, and the open price, as well as the volume for the uh Gamestock share. And we can see that the lowest price in period was $14. Uh not just 4, so it was higher, which is which shows why it's really important to verify your information before actually trying to do any work with it. Uh and then it also tells us that the maximum Gamestock close price in the period was uh of $8688. Uh however, this was obviously it was not in August 2020. It was in uh it was the 27th of January of 2021, which is where the short the short squeeze occurred, but we'll talk about that later. Right now we're just uh verifying the 4 cent claim. Here in the second panel we have the data for all the all the days of August. And indeed uh it never is 4 cents. The the lowest it gets is $14. So we know that that is not true. Then the next thing that I wanted to do was created uh was creating a basic visualizations. So here we got two charts showing kind of this information. This first one shows the daily closing price uh for the Gamestock starting here at August 2020 and ends the 28th of October, sorry, the 28th of February of 2021. So it's kind of a a sevenmon period where we can see the incredible increase in price that the Gamestock uh that Gamestock had. It's important to note that this chart the yaxis is on a logarithmic scale not on a regular scale. built on a logarithmic scale to show the massive price changes. Here we can see in August how it's pretty low around uh one to $5 but but slowly trending upwards. Then in December uh momentum builds but it's not crazy yet. And then here we can see of course uh in January 2021 the stock explodes vertically which shows the squeeze. And then in February 2021, it collapses back down as we can see right here, but it stays way above the old levels. Um, and this matters because this chart is kind of the backbone for the entire EMA analysis. It shows that there's a huge deviation from normal prices, a price move that cannot be explained by fundamentals or public information alone. and it shows the exact moment where retail behavior plus the short squeeze mechanics took over. So it's the point where the semi- strong EMH breaks down. Um then we have this following chart which is a GameStock daily trading volume. The trading volume is how many stocks how much stocks were traded in that single day. So here we can see the red dotted line at the bottom uh shows the average trading volume before 2021 which was around 43 million just above 43 million stocks each day. Uh which honestly really really surprised me. I did not expect that that many that that amount of stocks was being traded even when Gamestock was at its lowest like it it really really surprised me to see that huge number and we can see how uh from August to December it's the volume is low and steady has a few spikes in uh in in October but then steadies out again. But then in January 2021, the volume explodes massively to a point where some days reach six to almost 800 million shares traded on a single day. So there's a retail frenzy plus the short covering period. And this chart here is our evidence for the other side for the herd behavior for uh fear of missing out and social mediadriven buying as well as market stress. And here shows the 10-fold increase in volume which was stated in the assignment and we went over in our driver document. This tells us that rational like like this wasn't rational information processing. It was a crowd event which supports the case for behavioral explanations and shows the limits to arbitrage showing once again that EMH breaks down here. These two charts they show the full structure of the GME squeeze a slow small trend uh early on then an explosive price jump in January 2021. And this behavior doesn't align with uh efficient market uh idea that prices reflect information efficiently. Instead, the combination of extreme volume and vertical price right here movement suggests that a behavioral event amplified by short squeeze mechanics, not fundamentals. Uh and then we got the uh daily returns and abnormal days. Okay. So, here we have the the daily the top 10 positive daily returns where there were abnormal gains. Here stands out the 27th of January was the peak peak day of of of GameStock. The closing price was 86% and there was a 134% jump from the previous day like something crazy. Then we can see some other days in January 103.9% 92.7% 67 uh 51% everything. And here we can see that almost all of the top positive days are during the short squeeze window in a very tight cluster around late January, which is of course what you'd expect from a short squeeze. Forced buying by hedge funds, retail investors piling in, and halted trainings reopened at higher prices. This obviously is abnormal by any standard. EMH says that prices should adjust to information gradually and rationally and a stock doubling and or and even more than doubling in one single day is by no means a rational price discovery. It's a behavioral frenzy which is evidence that EMH is breaking down here. And then right below we have the top 10 negative daily returns where there were abnormal losses. Uh we have some days like the 2nd of February uh there was a negative 60%. Uh the 28th of January which was a negative 44% we have negative 42 negative 30%. So it's the same things as before. The worst crash days are right after the biggest spikes which shows the kind of to put it in an analogy the air coming out of the bubble as fast as it as it went in. So for example uh we have 138% one day then negative60% the next day and this volatility tells us that prices weren't driven by fundamentals and the market wasn't processing information normally. It was uh force leveraging was happening. Um, so here these tables show the most extreme daily returns. The biggest days, the biggest gains and losses happened within the squeeze windows. And these swings are far outside the normal market behavior. They're not explainable by fundamentals nor public news, which supports once again the argument that GME temporarily broke down semi strong EMA and was driven by behavioral forces. a and short squeeze mechanisms and then we have these uh eventbased analysis uh part of the EMH discussion. So here we're comparing uh two key events which is the Ryan Cohen uh when Ryan Cohen bought 13% uh taking in the company which was the 21st of September in 2020 and uh the short squeeze peak which was the 27th of January of 2021. And here I wanted to calculate the average return five days before these events and the average returns five days after the event. What the results show is that for the Ryan Cohen event 5 days the average return 5 days before the event was positive 9.48% and 5 days after was 3.42%. So here we know that the runup before the news is bigger than the runup after. This could indicate speculation, rumor or circulation. But I mean at the end of the day it's more normal because it's 9% 3% it could represent something but it's more normal compared to the second event that we're uh comparing it to which is the short squeeze peak. the the average return 5 days before was 34.26%. And the average return 5 days after was -2.90%. So this is kind of a sensitivity analysis that we're doing were the five days before the peak were insane. Everything overheated and the five days after show a crash. So the squeak unwound uh this pattern of course is absolutely incompatible with EMH. A 34% average runup before the peak followed by a 13% crash after is screaming herd behavior forced buying panic selling and market instability which is the perfect tie-in for our EMA discussion. Um uh here we know that this table shows is on. Then uh I wanted to include a benchmark comparison between the Gamestock stock. Wait, what? The Yeah. Yeah. The GME stock, the GameStop stock. Kind of a word play there. the game GameStop stock versus the S&P 500. So basically the market. So what here I wanted to download the S&P 500 and compare its buy and hold returns to the GameStop GameStop. And here it is absolutely insane what we can see from this information. The period is from uh the 1st of the 1st of August in 2020 to the 28th of February 2021. And here we can see of course here what we're taking into account is if we bought on the 1st of August of 20 and we sold 28th of February 2021. This crazy spy total return in this in this moment would be is of 16.64%. While the GameStop return on this period is 2,351.57%. So a stock with 2300% return in seven months is absolutely crazy, abnormal and unsustainable. It does not reflect fundamentals, does not align with EMH and cannot be predicted systematically. So the key concept here is that the rational versus the speculative profit. A rational investor uses public publicly available information, does not rely on perfect timing, and looks for repeatable systematic return opportunities. While a speculative investor gamles on timing, benefits from luck, hype, or extreme volatility and does not have a consistent strategy that they can repeat.",
