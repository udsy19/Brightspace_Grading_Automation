  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and explicitly identified that GME primarily challenges the semi-strong form. They provided multiple, concrete applications — fact checks, price/volume charts, abnormal-return lists, event-window comparisons, and benchmark returns — and used these to argue why semi-strong EMH failed in this episode, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student quantitatively compared pre- and post-event returns for multiple events (Ryan Cohen stake and the short-squeeze peak), interpreted run-ups occurring before public announcements, and used volume/return patterns to argue that markets did not immediately and accurately incorporate information. This multi-example, data-backed discussion demonstrates a solid, conceptually thorough treatment of information incorporation appropriate for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defined abnormal returns, computed multiple concrete examples (extreme daily returns, event-window pre/post averages, and a benchmark 2,351% vs 16.6% SPY return), and explained mechanisms (short-covering, retail frenzy, trading halts, limits to arbitrage) linking results to theory. Coverage is specific, applied across several analyses, and provides a thorough conceptual explanation appropriate for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-window comparisons and computed pre/post-event average returns and abnormal daily returns examples, demonstrating practical implementation. However, they did not document an expected-return model (market/model-based estimation), cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical significance testing—so the treatment is correct but methodologically incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student produced and interpreted abnormal-return outputs (pre/post-event averages and extreme daily returns), they explicitly attribute code generation to an AI tool and do not demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block understanding, or ownership of the implementation. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of running and explaining the code, the submission fails to meet the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed and reported data checks—planning the verification, running code to download historical prices, and concluding the $0.04 claim was false—so validation occurred. However, they did not name or cite external trusted sources or tools used for cross-checking (e.g., specific data provider or website), which the rubric requires for a full PASS; therefore PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tomas — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve started to think like a DRIVER practitioner. Your work shows a crisp fusion of finance intuition and technology: you didn’t just drop a tool into the analysis, you used it to expose cash‑flow drivers and link them to valuation outcomes. Your written explanations were equally strong — you translate model logic into business terms that a CFO or product lead can act on, which is exactly the communication muscle we value.\n\nNow, let’s turn that momentum into concrete next steps for the one technical area to strengthen. Treat this as tooling the thinking, not “coding for coding’s sake.” Practical actions you can take next:\n- Institutionalize model guardrails: formalize input assumptions, allowable ranges, and error checks so a user can’t unknowingly feed implausible data into a financial forecast.\n- Build simple validation and sensitivity routines: for every key output, show which inputs move it the most and why; that makes tradeoffs explicit for decision makers.\n- Create reproducible deliverables: package a short playbook with data provenance, key formulas, and a one‑page executive summary so the model becomes a reliable business asset.\n- Automate scenario snapshots: have a small, repeatable process that produces best/worst/central case reports for stakeholders before meetings.\n\nThese steps map directly to typical finance roles — they make your analyses auditable, defensible, and fast to iterate during quarterly planning or M&A diligence.\n\nKeep treating the code and tools as logic guardrails that serve your financial reasoning. You’re on a trajectory from competent problem solver to a systematic, business-focused analyst. This is a career skill that compounds — stay curious, iterate in small, business‑relevant experiments, and I’ll be excited to see where you take it next."
