  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly specified and applied an event-study methodology (windows, CAPM regression, AR/CAR computation) and reported numerical results and statistical checks, demonstrating practical mastery. They also discussed limitations and robustness steps, showing thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined the semi-strong test (day-zero vs post-event drift), implemented an event-study (windows, CAPM, AR/CAR) and reported statistical and economic evidence showing multi-day drift and rapid reversal. Their analysis of persistence, significance, risk adjustment, and frictions demonstrates a thorough, applied treatment of how quickly and accurately markets reflected information.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student produced multiple data-driven insights beyond basic computations: documented abnormal returns with statistical tests, linked large volume spikes and high beta to a retail-driven short squeeze, and evaluated economic exploitability given trading constraints. They also proposed sensible robustness steps, indicating synthesis of finance and technology outputs into actionable insights, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a correct, applied understanding of the semi-strong form (explicit hypothesis, event-study method, and interpretation of post-event drift), but does not meaningfully address tests or implications for the weak and strong forms. Because treatment is strong for semi-strong but incomplete across the three EMH forms, the score is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and links overconfidence and attention bias to the GameStop episode and uses empirical AR/CAR evidence to support behavioral explanations, but they do not address anchoring, herding, loss aversion, or mental accounting. Coverage is accurate but incomplete across the specified set of biases, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and empirically tests short-term momentum/persistence using an event-study and links results to behavioral drivers, showing applied understanding. However, they do not address other listed anomalies (value, size, calendar effects), so coverage is accurate but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: framed the verification question and scope.  \n- Implement: performed a data audit (price correction), volume checks, and reported event timing.  \n- Represent/Validate: documented corrected figures and used them as inputs to the event-study analysis.",
      "reasoning": "The student explicitly audited historical price data, identified and documented a clear discrepancy (the erroneous $0.04 claim), and reported verified numeric facts (volume averages, spike, event date). These actions satisfy the requirement to verify numerical claims and document discrepancies, so the criterion is met."

  "personalized_feedback": "Sean — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a clear DRIVER approach. You consistently integrated finance ideas with technology: your use of structured logic to map cash flow drivers and your choice to let AI handle repetitive calculations showed maturity. Your explanations were especially strong — you walked through assumptions, described why a model step mattered for the business, and communicated results in a way a finance partner could act on. Those are exactly the habits that turn “monkey minds” into reliable analysts.\n\nFor next steps, treat a few remaining conceptual rough edges as experiments to refine rather than mistakes to hide. Concretely:\n- Reconcile model outputs to accounting statements each time you change an assumption. That simple guardrail will catch mis-specified accruals or timing mismatches that matter in FP&A and valuation work.\n- Add a short sensitivity checklist to every analysis: which 3 inputs change the decision outcome? Run scenario and stress tests and narrate the business implications (e.g., pricing, working capital, covenant risk).\n- Document your model assumptions in plain English with a link to how a finance stakeholder would measure those assumptions in practice (sales channels, customer cohorts, AR days). This connects technical work to business controls and auditability.\n\nKeep treating code and AI as execution assistants, not the destination. The systematic thinking you’re building — explicit assumptions, traceable logic, and stakeholder-oriented explanations — is what will scale in a corporate finance career. This is a long arc; you’re well on your way. I’m excited to see where you take these habits next."
