  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a clear, concrete event-study methodology with specified data inputs, estimation window, AR/CAR calculation, and statistical testing, and it reports empirical findings—evidence of applied understanding (IMPLEMENT) and interpretation (REFLECT). While not exhaustively detailed on every robustness check, the treatment is specific and operationalized, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames information incorporation as the target, implements an event‑study with specified windows and statistical testing, and interprets empirical timing (significant event-day return and quick mean reversion). This applied methodology plus result interpretation shows a thorough, operational understanding of how quickly and accurately markets reflect new information, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market‑efficiency testing problem and lays out a concrete, replicable research design (data source, CAPM model, 200‑day estimation window, ±10‑day event window, AR/CAR, and t‑tests), satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration. The methodological steps are sufficiently detailed to be understood and defended.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms and demonstrates applied understanding of semi-strong EMH via an event-study (IMPLEMENT) and interprets results accordingly (REFLECT). However, treatment is not comprehensive across all forms nor deeply detailed (limited discussion of weak/strong distinctions or multiple supporting examples), so the submission shows solid but incomplete mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies behavioral biases (overconfidence, herding, loss aversion) to explain the GameStop episode and ties them to empirical findings, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief and lacks coverage of some listed biases (anchoring, mental accounting) and deeper analysis or concrete examples/tests, so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references momentum and size effects and provides an implemented event‑study framework that could test anomalies, showing conceptual and technical readiness (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT). However, the submission only mentions these anomalies superficially without detailed analysis, empirical results, or discussion of value or calendar effects, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.",

You’ve moved from ad-hoc answers to a repeatable process: you consistently lay out your Decision question, build a clear Rationale, identify the Inputs you need, and structure a viable Execution plan. Concrete examples stood out — your cash-flow decomposition for the valuation exercise, the way you flagged key assumptions up front, and your use of scenario branches to show downside risk. Those are the habits of a systematic finance thinker, not a “monkey mind.”\n\nNext steps to deepen that advantage: treat those scenario branches as living business tools. In practice this means (1) turning your assumption table into a sensitivity matrix so stakeholders can see which levers—price, volume, margin—move enterprise value the most; (2) running a simple probabilistic (Monte Carlo or percentile) analysis on top scenarios to quantify forecast confidence for FP&A or M&A discussions; and (3) translating model outputs into 3–4 crisp business recommendations tied to capital allocation (e.g., delay investment if IRR falls below target under stress). These are small, concrete extensions of what you already do and directly applicable in corporate finance, investor conversations, and strategic planning.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as your mental checklist. Over the next year, that systematic habit will let you move faster, ask sharper questions in meetings, and make decisions with conviction. This is a long game — you’re building a toolkit that will pay dividends in every finance role you take on. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
