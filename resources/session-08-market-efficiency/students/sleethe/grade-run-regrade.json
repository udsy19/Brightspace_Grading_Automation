  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms, focuses on semi-strong efficiency, and implements an appropriate event-study methodology (CAPM, AR/CAR) to test market reaction to public information. Their reflection links empirical findings to the semi-strong form and discusses behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage factors, demonstrating a strong, applied conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study workflow (model choice, estimation window, event window, AR/CAR calculation, and statistical testing) and applies it to interpret outcomes, showing both implementation and reflection. These specifics and the interpretation meet the standard for a thorough, applied treatment of event-study methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only framed the information-incorporation question but implemented an appropriate event-study (model, estimation/event windows, AR/CAR, t-tests) and interpreted timing and accuracy of market response (event-day significance followed by quick mean reversion). This combination of method and interpretation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly describes the event-study methodology, parameters, and reports results, showing an attempted and partially executed AR/CAR calculation. However, they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block-by-block/code-level explanations and ownership required for a PASS under the strict technical implementation standard.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly defines EMH forms and accurately identifies and applies the semi-strong form (quotes 1–2) and links findings to that framework (quote 3). However the treatment is brief and lacks depth, multiple examples, or detailed implications required for a full PASS, so it meets the PARTIAL standard.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Ethan — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. In your recent work you didn’t just recite finance concepts; you applied them step-by-step: you framed the valuation question precisely, identified the relevant cash-flow drivers, and used those drivers to stress-test assumptions. Your ability to translate financial logic into a reproducible decision path — and to connect that path to a simple tech-enabled artifact — shows you’ve moved from “monkey mind” reactions to deliberate, systematized analysis. That systematic thinking is exactly the transformation DRIVER aims for.\n\nNow, let’s talk next steps to sharpen impact in real-world finance roles. You’ve shown progress on technical implementation but can make a bigger leap by structuring models for repeatability and business use. Practical next steps:\n- Modularize your financial models: separate assumptions, calculations, and outputs so a CFO or analyst can update scenarios without breaking formulas.\n- Add simple validation checks (logic guardrails): balance checks, sign checks on cash flows, and sanity-range flags for key inputs.\n- Build one end-to-end business use case: e.g., an investment memo supported by a scenario-based NPV model and a short dashboard showing sensitivity to key drivers.\n- Use AI as an execution assistant: prompt it to generate unit-test ideas, create concise documentation, or turn assumptions into annotated model cells.\n\nKeep treating modeling as a communication tool for decisions. Your systematic habits will compound — they make you faster, clearer, and more credible in teams that allocate capital. This is an ongoing journey; keep iterating, and you’ll find your models becoming the trusted basis for real business choices. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
