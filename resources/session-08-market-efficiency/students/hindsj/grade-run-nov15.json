  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem, lists clear objectives, and outlines the analysis steps and data inputs (event timeline, price/volume, statistical tests), providing a coherent research design. This level of explicit planning and scoping satisfies the strict Define & Discover requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, concrete framework for analyzing efficiency around the GameStop event (timeline, data inputs, specific tests, and visualizations). The plan is explicit and directly aligned with the research objectives, satisfying the strict Represent requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, organized workflow: they defined tasks, retrieved data, generated multiple outputs (price/volume charts, C-chart) and ran formal tests (Ljung–Box) consistent with an event-study. This demonstrates systematic implementation of the event-study methodology, meeting the criterion (minor methodological specifics were not exhaustively documented but are not required at this assessment level).\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests weak-form violation (autocorrelation/Ljung–Box) and uses an event-study measure to argue semi-strong inefficiency, demonstrating applied understanding and implementation. However, treatment is not thorough: the discussion of the strong form is unclear/conflated with abnormal profits and lacks targeted testing or conceptual detail, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study concept (calculated cumulative abnormal returns and presented a 291% spike) and implemented data retrieval and analysis code, showing practical understanding. However, key methodological details are missing (no description of the expected-return model, estimation/event windows, normalization or statistical significance testing of CAR), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses abnormal returns and event-study outputs to argue that public information was not immediately reflected (semi-strong inefficiency) and supports this with price/volume evidence. However, the analysis lacks methodological detail and explicit timing analysis (event/estimation windows, return model, statistical significance over short horizons) required to thoroughly evaluate how quickly information was incorporated, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jonathan —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve reshaped your approach this term. Your work shows a clear move from reactive problem-solving to DRIVER-style, stepwise thinking: you consistently define the decision, identify the relevant inputs, and structure assumptions before diving into analysis. In particular, your case write-ups used concise decision trees and identified which cash flows drive valuation — that level of financial clarity is exactly what employers in FP&A and corporate development look for. I also noticed real progress in tying models to business context: your notes about seasonality and customer churn reflected a maturing ability to link numbers to operational reality. Your written explanations have become more audience-aware too — explaining tradeoffs in plain language rather than just reporting outputs.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: focus on one technical implementation area that can unlock clearer business answers. Practice translating scenario assumptions into a small set of stress tests (e.g., ±10/20% demand and margin cases) and produce a one-page executive summary that highlights the top two drivers and recommended action. Apply this in a business context — pick a real company or a class case and produce a “what to do” memo for leadership based on the model. That will bridge the remaining technical gap and make your analyses directly actionable for decision-makers.\n\nKeep treating the DRIVER framework as a professional habit, not a classroom task. Systematic thinking will compound: as you run more structured analyses, your intuition will become faster and more reliable. I’m excited to see where you take this approach — you’re building a career skill that sets you apart."
