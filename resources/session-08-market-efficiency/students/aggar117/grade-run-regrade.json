  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly tested how quickly markets incorporated information using an event-study, quantified abnormal returns and CARs across pre/during/post windows, and reported statistical validation—demonstrating both speed and accuracy analyses. The work supplies multiple concrete measures (percent abnormal returns, CAR behavior, t-statistic) and interprets persistence vs immediate discovery, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate-evidence category.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defined abnormal returns, explained the CAPM-based calculation, implemented an event-study workflow in code, and reported quantified AR/CAR results with interpretation. Coverage includes conceptual definition, methodological application, numerical outcomes, and implications—meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the research question (testing semi-strong EMH), specified the chosen methodology (event study), and contextualized the test with identified events—meeting the strict requirement for a clear, defensible Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a correct and applied understanding of the semi-strong form (definition, event-study method, CAPM, significance testing), but it does not discuss the weak or strong forms or contrast them with the semi-strong form. Because coverage is accurate and applied for semi-strong but incomplete across the three EMH forms, the appropriate rating is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework and calculated abnormal returns using CAPM, with reported CARs and hypothesis testing, showing practical implementation and validation. However, methodological details (estimation window, beta estimation procedure, event-window specification, inference adjustments) and clarity on some reported statistics are missing or inconsistent, so the treatment is accurate but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (CAPM-based ARs, CARs) and ran code producing statistics and a t-test, showing personal implementation and validation. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, stepwise verification, or detailed ownership of each implementation element, so the work is correct but not demonstrated in the explicit depth required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Krish — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve shifted from scattered problem-solving to a clear, repeatable approach. Your work consistently shows two standout strengths: you marry finance intuition with technology (your models consistently translate business questions into executable steps), and you’ve internalized the DRIVER structure — your submissions follow a logical sequence, surface key assumptions, and include validation checkpoints. Concretely, I noticed you explicitly framed the valuation question before building the model and used scenario runs to probe outcomes — that’s exactly the kind of systematic thinking we aim for.\n\nFor the next steps, treat the areas where you’ve shown progress as springboards rather than deficits. Continue sharpening financial-concept accuracy by (1) documenting the economic story behind each assumption (how revenue drivers map to market behavior), (2) expanding sensitivity and stress tests to reflect realistic business shocks (e.g., demand decline, margin compression), and (3) translating model outputs into decision-oriented metrics (IRR, payback under multiple scenarios) that a CFO or investor would use. On the technical side, codify simple “logic guardrails” in your models — input-validation checks, clearly labeled assumptions, and short README notes — so stakeholders can audit and reuse your work without diving into code.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution assistants: use them to generate test cases, draft explanations, and surface alternative hypotheses, but let your DRIVER process guide which tests matter. You’re on a trajectory that will make you a reliable, strategic thinker in finance — the kind of person organizations trust with complex tradeoffs. This is a journey; keep iterating, and you’ll keep converting ambiguity into disciplined decisions."
