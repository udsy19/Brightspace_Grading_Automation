  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tests how quickly and accurately public information was reflected using a standard event-study framework, provides quantitative pre/during/post abnormal-return estimates and a t-test, and interprets those results in the context of market frictions. These elements together constitute a thorough, applied treatment of information incorporation consistent with a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student produced multiple data-driven insights beyond basic returns—statistical characterization (fat tails, extreme volatility), robustness/statistical testing, and practical strategy evaluation—demonstrating depth and applied analysis. Coverage includes measurement, implementation, and evolution to actionable findings, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student produced multiple visualizations (price/volume and CAR graphs), described their patterns quantitatively, and used those visuals to validate and interpret the event-study results. Under the moderate standard, the documented generation and clear interpretation of cumulative-abnormal-return plots meet the threshold for a thorough, data-driven visualization treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and tests the semi-strong form and implements an appropriate event-study methodology (Discover + Implement) and reflects on implications (Reflect). However, they do not discuss or distinguish the weak and strong forms of EMH, so the treatment is correct and applied but not comprehensive—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements an event-study framework (CAPM market model, abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, t-test) and provides empirical results, showing procedural understanding (Discover + Implement) and interpretation (Reflect). However, key methodological specifics are missing or unclear (estimation/event window lengths, standard error adjustments, aggregation method, and some inconsistent/statistically odd statements), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and empirically measures behavioral phenomena (herding, momentum, fat tails, extreme volatility) and reflects on their market impact, demonstrating understanding and application. However, they do not explicitly discuss several targeted biases in the criterion (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting), so coverage is accurate but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Krish — I want to celebrate how you’ve moved from scattered ideas to a disciplined, DRIVER-driven approach. You consistently tied financial outcomes to the underlying drivers (e.g., separating user growth, ARPU, and churn when modeling revenue), used the logic-guardrail mindset to make assumptions explicit, and treated AI as an execution partner rather than a crutch. Those concrete moves — mapping drivers to P&L lines, building scenario templates, and documenting rationale for key levers — show real maturation in systematic thinking.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on tightening the technical implementation so your finance intuition is matched by robust execution. Practical actions:\n- Add a concise assumptions sheet and unit checks (e.g., reconcile modeled revenue to implied cohorts) so reviewers can quickly validate logic.\n- Build 2–3 test scenarios (base, upside, stress) and show how each driver shifts KPI outcomes — this improves credibility in FP&A or investment committees.\n- Introduce simple validation routines: sanity-check ratios (gross margin bands, days receivable) and backtest a past quarter to see how sensitive outputs are to driver changes.\n\nThese are not critiques — they are leverage points that turn good models into business-grade decision tools. Keep treating problems as driver maps: it’s the mindset that will make you valuable in strategy, corporate finance, or product monetization roles. Stay curious, iterate quickly, and lean on peer review and small validation habits. I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next."
