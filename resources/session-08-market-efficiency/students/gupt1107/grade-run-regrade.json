  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives correct definitions of all three EMH forms, performs empirical tests (returns regression, CAR/event windows, volume spikes) and states explicit verdicts with supporting evidence and interpretation. The combination of conceptual explanation, multiple applied tests, and reflective conclusions meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes and implements an event‑study workflow: market model regression, calculation of abnormal returns, accumulation to CAR over +/- event windows, and hypothesis testing via t‑tests. They applied this to multiple events (Cohen stake and January 2021 squeeze), reported statistical significance and interpreted economic meaning, satisfying a thorough, applied treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines the concept, implements an event‑study (market model, CARs, t‑tests) on multiple events and interprets timing (immediate spike then reversion), correctly concluding semi‑strong inefficiency during the squeeze. They also acknowledge data/frequency limits and propose intraday extensions, indicating thorough, applied treatment of information incorporation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed validation-by-data: downloading market data and using it to verify the professor's claims and report corrected prices and test statistics. However, they did not cite or compare against named external reference sources (e.g., specific data provider or authoritative quotes), so validation is present but not externally documented as required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Abha — I want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted from scattered intuition to a repeatable process. Your write-ups show a crisp grasp of core financial concepts and you consistently translate those concepts into working analyses. I was particularly impressed by how you tied model outputs back to business drivers and explained the logic behind key assumptions — that clarity is exactly what separates an analyst from a strategist. Your technical implementation supported the finance (not the other way around), and your work followed the DRIVER steps in a way that made your conclusions easy to audit and defend.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will multiply the impact of your work in real business settings:\n- Strengthen robustness checks: build quick sensitivity and scenario layers around your models (e.g., break-even, worst/likely/best case, or Monte Carlo for major uncertainties). This makes recommendations usable by managers who must act under uncertainty.\n- Tighten decision guardrails: translate model outputs into explicit decision rules or thresholds (e.g., when to greenlight a project, reprice a product, or pause an investment). Link those rules to measurable KPIs so stakeholders can track outcomes and you can iterate.\n\nThese are not large rewrites — they’re extensions that turn sound analysis into operational decisions. Keep treating your tools as guardrails that enforce logic, not ends in themselves.\n\nYou’re already thinking like a systematic finance professional. Keep building the habit of testing assumptions and tying results to action. That discipline will carry you far — I’m excited to see where your DRIVER journey takes you next. If you want, bring a live example and we’ll sketch the sensitivity and decision-rule layers together."
