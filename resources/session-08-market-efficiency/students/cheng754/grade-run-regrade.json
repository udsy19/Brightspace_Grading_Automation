  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem and documented discovery actions (fact-checking, data corrections), demonstrating clear, self-contained Define & Discover work. This meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit represent-stage plan with concrete methods (Python/YFinance, moving averages) and a qualitative comparison for semi-strong testing, satisfying the strict requirement for an articulated analysis layout. Discover and Implement stages support that the plan was grounded and actionable.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow from plan to code to output, producing multiple analysis artifacts (price/volume charts and MA plots) that align with their represent-stage plan. Although some analyses were noted as still being refined, the methodological execution is organized and yields concrete results, meeting the criterion for systematic implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses weak and semi-strong forms and describes concrete tests (moving averages, comparison to public fundamentals), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is incomplete (the weak-form test was not fully realized, the strong form is not addressed, and the analysis relies on qualitative inference), so the work demonstrates correct but basic coverage rather than the thorough depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected data and discussed basic tests (moving averages) but did not describe or execute an event-study methodology (event/estimation windows, benchmark model) nor compute abnormal or cumulative abnormal returns. Given the specific criterion requires event-study and abnormal-return calculations, the submission is missing the required analyses.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how market prices related to public information (semi-strong form) and uses data/volume visuals to support the claim, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform explicit timing or quantitative tests of how quickly information was incorporated (no event-window, abnormal-return, or speed-of-adjustment measures), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Michelle — I’ve enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation this term. You’ve become noticeably more systematic: your problem setups now open with a clear Decision question, you consistently list Assumptions before modeling, and your explanations walk through Results in a way that makes the logic traceable. In class discussions you used AI as an execution assistant wisely (prompting it to produce sensitivity tables and then critiquing the output), and your communication has improved — your narratives tie model outputs to business implications instead of just presenting numbers.\n\nNext steps to build on that foundation:\n- Financial concepts: tighten the link between cash flows and value. When you model a project, explicitly reconcile incremental free cash flow, depreciation tax shields, and terminal value. Practice one business case (e.g., a 3-year product launch) where you map every line item back to a real-world source (sales drivers, working capital, capex) and justify the discount rate you choose.\n- Technical implementation: make your calculation logic auditable. Adopt a simple “calculation trace” habit: one sheet for inputs/assumptions, one for line-item derivation with comments, and one for outputs. Run a set of unit checks (e.g., add-up tests, currency/unit consistency, and a cash-flow-to-balance-sheet check) and keep that checklist with the model.\n- Integration: translate model revisions into decisions. After running scenarios, write a one-paragraph decision memo: what action would you recommend to a CFO/CEO and why?\n\nKeep treating the code and tools as guardrails — the real value is the chain of reasoning you’ve built. Systematic thinking will make you a better analyst, strategist, and leader; this is a career skill that compounds. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in your final project."
