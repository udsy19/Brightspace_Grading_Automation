You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and explicitly applies them via an event-study simulation and the GameStop example, showing nuanced understanding (including limits to arbitrage and time-horizon issues). Their DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages provide multiple concrete examples and an integrated analysis, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains event-study setup, the AR = actual − expected framework (CAPM-based), implementation steps in code, and computed metrics (CAR, efficiency ratio) while discussing significance and practical limits. These DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT elements show a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology and abnormal-return calculations consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains how to measure speed and accuracy (event-study setup, AR = actual − expected via CAPM, CAR, efficiency ratio), implements a simulation to quantify immediate vs. delayed reactions, and reflects on significance and real-world limits. These DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT elements provide the depth and applied examples required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates internal validation (re-running the script, checking patterns, and asking about statistical/economic significance) but provides no external checks or named sources/tools to compare results. This meets PARTIAL: systematic self‑validation present but lacks the external validation required for PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jeenay — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from ad-hoc thinking to a disciplined DRIVER approach. You consistently anchored your solutions in sound financial logic (clear use of valuation drivers and risk concepts), integrated those ideas with a technical solution that actually enforces the logic guardrails, and explained your reasoning in a way a CFO or product manager could follow. Those are concrete signs that your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker: you identify the right levers, build a reproducible way to test them, and communicate the results clearly.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will make your work even more business-ready:\n- Explicitly tie model outputs to decisions: after each analysis, add a one-paragraph decision memo that states the recommended action, the key assumption that drives that recommendation, and the potential business impact (cash flow, margin, or risk exposure). This turns analysis into actionable advice for stakeholders.\n- Build routine robustness checks: implement quick sensitivity analyses and one stress test for your core scenarios. For example, show how a 200-bp change in discount rate or a 10% demand shock alters the recommendation. That habit reduces deployment risk and makes your work defensible in board-level conversations.\n\nKeep treating tools (including AI) as execution assistants and the framework as your compass. As you strengthen the link between model outputs and concrete business decisions, you’ll move from reliable analyst to strategic partner. This is a long, compounding journey — you’ve cleared important early milestones. Stay curious, keep documenting assumptions, and lean into scenario thinking; the systematic habits you’re building now will compound into real career leverage."
