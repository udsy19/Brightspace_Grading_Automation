Their work moves from conceptual definition to methodological representation, execution, and reflection, meeting the threshold for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately describes event-study methodology (estimation window, event day, AR formula, CAPM expected return), implements it in code (computing ARs, cumulative ARs, efficiency ratio with classification thresholds), and reflects on statistical and economic validity. This combination of conceptual explanation, applied simulation, and critical reflection meets the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines and operationalizes how to measure information incorporation (event-study, AR, CAPM), implements the calculations in code (efficiency ratio, cumulative ARs), and interprets results including statistical/economic caveats and real-case implications. This combination of conceptual clarity, applied method, and reflective analysis satisfies the standards for a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies major anomalies (momentum, value, size, calendar) and links the concept to their simulation and the GameStop example (Discover, Implement, Reflect). However, treatment is brief and lacks detailed explanation, empirical examples, or separate analysis of each anomaly—meeting the criteria for a correct but incomplete (PARTIAL) demonstration under the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes and implements the AR = actual − expected concept using CAPM and reports running a simulation computing ARs and cumulative ARs, demonstrating procedural understanding (Represent, Implement). However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide explicit, block-level code outputs, regression/alpha estimation, or formal statistical verification of CAPM-based ARs and thus fall short of full, defensible technical demonstration — hence PARTIAL.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student moves beyond basic calculation by implementing a simulation, computing aggregate metrics (cumulative AR, efficiency ratio), running multiple trials, and drawing interpretive, data-driven insights tied to GameStop. However, they did not analyze real data, report formal statistical tests, or present deeper quantitative validation, so the work is correct and insightful but incomplete — therefore PARTIAL.",

So from uh days 10 to 1 is the estimation period, day 0 is the event day and more than 10 days is the postevent period. So the formula that we use is abnormal return A R is equal to actual return minus the expected return and the expected return can be found from CAPM...\"",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jeenay — I’ve been impressed by how you’ve shifted from scattered thinking to methodical analysis. You consistently anchor problems in core financial logic (clear cash-flow orientation, disciplined risk-return framing, and attention to relevant valuation drivers). Your use of the DRIVER steps to define the problem, identify assumptions, and reason through tradeoffs shows genuine development in systematic thinking — you no longer chase every rabbit hole, you prioritize the levers that move value.\n\nFor next steps, treat the remaining gaps as practical extensions of that same approach:\n- Technical implementation: translate your logical frameworks into repeatable spreadsheet templates (modular inputs, a clear assumptions tab, and a sensitivity table). Start with one real-world application — e.g., a capital budgeting case for a new product — and build a simple model you can stress-test.\n- Integration of finance and technology: practice linking financial logic to business systems. Create a short mapping: which KPI from ops feeds which line in the P&L, and how would a dashboard update change a decision? This habit bridges analysis to execution in corporate settings.\n- Communication clarity: after you finish an analysis, write a 150–200 word executive summary that states the recommendation, the top two drivers behind it, and one key risk with a proposed mitigant. Then produce one visual (chart/table) that supports that summary.\n\nKeep seeing this as a journey. The disciplined thinking you’ve cultivated will make you a trusted finance partner in any business — not because you can code or crunch numbers fast, but because you make decisions transparent, testable, and actionable. I’m excited to watch your next iteration. — Prof. Zhang"
