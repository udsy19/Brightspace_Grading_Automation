  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, specific treatment of weak/semi-strong/strong forms with concrete examples (high short interest, Ryan Cohen stake, price/volume spikes) and mechanisms (momentum, limits to arbitrage, broker halts). They also propose further rigorous tests (event study, short-interest time series, NLP sentiment), demonstrating depth and a strong conceptual grasp across DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency research question, identified a concrete discovery task (fact-check the 4¢ claim), specified a reproducible data/research design (yfinance, adjusted close, volume, planned plots), and executed the verification. This meets the strict requirement for a well-defined Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student produced a clear, executable framework for analyzing the event (data source, fields, time range, and specific visualizations) and tied those elements to the analytical goals (testing EMH forms). The plan is explicit and reproducible, and the student carried out the core planned checks, satisfying the strict Represent-stage requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of event studies and cumulative abnormal returns and explicitly proposes the methodology, but they did not implement the event study or compute abnormal returns, nor did they specify estimation window, benchmark model, or statistical tests. That partial but correct treatment merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and applies multiple concrete examples (short interest, SEC filing, WSB, price/volume spike, broker halts) to argue that semi‑strong information incorporation failed. However, they did not perform quantitative timing or statistical tests (no event-study, no date-by-date linkage or abnormal-return calculations) to rigorously measure how quickly or accurately information was incorporated, so the treatment is solid but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several key biases (herding, confirmation bias, overconfidence) and connects them to market mechanics, showing good conceptual understanding. However, several listed biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed or developed, and treatment is qualitative rather than comprehensive, so the work is correct but incomplete.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: identified the explicit numerical claim to verify (4¢ in Aug 2020).  \n- Implement: pulled primary data via yfinance in Colab and ran code to extract the historical low.  \n- Validate/Reflect: compared script output to the prompt claim, documented the discrepancy, and adjusted the analysis accordingly.",
      "reasoning": "The student explicitly identified the numerical claim, executed a primary‑data check (yfinance/Colab), printed the verified historical value, and documented that the prompt's number was incorrect and by how much. This satisfies the requirement to verify numerical claims and record discrepancies."

  "personalized_feedback": "Taylor — I’ve been impressed by how your work has shifted from quick intuition to deliberate, traceable reasoning. You consistently break problems into clear sub-parts (revenue drivers, cost behavior, and working-capital impacts), state assumptions up front, and walk through the valuation logic so a stakeholder could follow your conclusions. That concrete habit of documenting why a number moves when an assumption changes is exactly the kind of systematic thinking DRIVER trains for.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (not problems to fix): tighten the technical implementation by building simple validation checks into your models — e.g., balance-sheet reconciliation, sign checks, and plausibility bounds on growth rates — so financial outputs can’t drift from business reality. To strengthen integration with business finance, map model outputs to decision levers: translate a scenario’s EBITDA and cash flow into implications for capex, financing choices, or pricing decisions. Practically, run a two-way sensitivity (price × volume) and prepare a one-page slide that ties scenarios to recommended actions (delay capex, raise prices, reprice contracts). For following DRIVER more fully, adopt a brief end-of-work checklist: restate the business question, list the top 3 assumptions, show the sanity checks run, and note the recommended next analytic steps.\n\nKeep leaning into this approach. The habit of making your logic auditable — not just your answers — is rare and career-defining in finance. Treat each model as an argument you must convince a CFO with: disciplined, transparent, and action-oriented. If you want, bring your next draft to office hours and we’ll walk the checklist together and shape the decision memo you’d give a CFO. Keep building that systematic muscle — you’re on a very promising trajectory."
