  "transcript": "Okay, so this is the driver analysis for session eight um the GameStop short squeeze and market efficiency. So for define and discover, I define the problem. So the objective is to investigate the GameStop short squeeze event as a case study for market efficiency. Um I need to analyze GameStop's price behavior against predictions of the efficient market hypothesis. And this involves testing which form of efficient market hypothesis weak, semi- strong or strong, was violated, assessing explanations from behavioral finance, evaluating if systematic profit opportunities existed for a rational investor and verifying all factual claims in the assignment prompt. So for the discover step um so the prompt contains a critical first step and that is to verify a specific numerical claim that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. And so initially I used Google search to find historical GameStop price data for August 2020. And the search results for the GameStop GameStop stock price of August 2020 show a price range and not a single value. Um, one result provides a table for August 2020 with prices ranging from a dollar4 cents to $167. And another result shows prices for all of 2020 with a low of 0.85 85 in April of 2020 and prices around 1.15 in August of 2020. So my initial conclusion is that the prompt statement that GameStop traded at 4 cents is definite definitely false. Um the actual price in August 2020 was significantly higher likely in the dollar to 1.7 range and the all-time low in 2020 was also much higher around 0.85. 85. So this discrepancy is a critical finding and will be the first item I validate with primary data source. Um Yahoo Finance is what I'll be using in the implementation stage. For the remainder of the analysis, the verified data will be used as my numbers. So in the represent stage, um this stage is planning out the how. Um it's how I will model the problem, what data I will use, and what steps I'll take. So my data source, I'll be using the Y finance library in Python to pull historical stock data. This is a st a standard and reliable source for financial analysis. Um some of the data I'll need is the ticker GME, the time period, um January 1st of 2020 to today, November 12th, 2025. um some data points adjusted close price which accounts for splits and dividends and volume some tools the Y finance for data acquisition and map plot library for data visualization so some of the analytical steps I'll be taking in the implementation stage I'll be importing the libraries and downloading the GameStop data um I will also be executing the critical first step by generating two plots to visualize the event. So plot one will be a line chart of GameStop adjusted close price from 2020 to the present. This will visually show the near bankruptcy level, the Ryan Cohen buyin period, mass spike in January 2021 and the subsequent stabilization. Um plot two will be bar chart of GameStop volume over the same period. This must be aligned with price chart to show the massive increase in trading volume during the squeeze. And so during the validation, I will analyze the charts and data to test the EMH. Um for the weak form violation, does the show chart show predictability? Um for the semi strong form violation, did the price reflect all public information? And this is the core of the analysis. So, some of the information, um, high short interest, 140% was public. Ryan Cohen's 13% stake was public, which is the SEC filing, and the Wall Street Bets campaign was public. The analysis, um, the price explosion to 40 $483 was disconnected from fundamental value. The analyst estimates estimates 10 to $40. The market failed to incorporate this ma this public information rationally. This is a clear and massive violation of semi- strong form efficiency. So for strong form violation since semi- strong is violated strong form which includes all private info is also violated by definition. So another step of the validation is I'm going to be applying behavioral finance concepts. So hurting in social media, the event was driven by a coordinated self-reinforcing herd of retail investors via the Reddit thread wall street vets and also has confirmation bias and overconfidence. Investors sought information that confirmed their to the moon thesis and believe they could not lose and just there are some limits to arbitrage and this is the rational explanation for why the price remained wrong. So for the implementation stage um this stage details the final code used to conduct the analysis um the implementmentation was performed in Google Collab to ensure a consistent and reliable environment. The first command installs the Y finance library and then the main script then imports libraries, downloads the data, performs the critical fact check required by the prompt and generates the two necessary um visualizations. I did have a few iterations of this code. So the charts do not accurately represent what I intended to represent. They still have the same data but not the same chart format. So here is the code as you can see it installs the Y finance libraries library imports the other libraries which is map plot library um downloads the GameStop data from Y finance executes the critical first steps this is going to verify the claim that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 with the Y finance data. It will then also filter the data to only include August of 2020 to make this fil like the data search a little bit easier. And then the if statement checks if we found data. So then this is where we find the single lowest close price and store it. And then it'll just print that. So then the next step is to create the visualizations. So it will plot the GME price and this plots the co price and then it will also plot the volume. So as you can see here um here's the first chart. This chart is the most important. It shows the stock price was flat and very low around a dollar to $2 for most of 2020. And then in January 21, it explodes upward and near in a nearly vertical line to its peak price. And after the peak, it crashes down but settles at a new normal price that is still much higher than the 2020 levels. So here is the second chart. Um, this chart lines up perfectly with the price chart. It shows almost no trading volume for all of 2020. And then in January 2021, at the exact same time as the price spike, the volume explodes, showing a massive number of shares were being traded. And this is the visual proof of the retail frenzy. So our validation of the critical first step, um the Python script produced the following definitive output. The actual low price of August 2020 was $104. And so the conclusions prompts claim is verifiably false. Um this confirms the initial discover finding. Um the prompt's claim of or sense is incorrect by a factor of over 25 and this analysis will proceed using the correct verified data. So just some observations based on the charts. Um the price chart clearly shows the stock trading in the$1 to $2 range throughout mid 2020 um which is the near bankruptcy levels. It then shows a near vertical spike in January 2021 peaking at over $80 or $483 pre-split. Um a fact we can cite from our initial research. After the peak, the price crashes but stabilizes at a new normal far higher than the 2020 lows. And so another observation, um the volume chart is just as dramatic. It shows near zero trading volume for most of 2020 and then explodes in January 2021, perfectly matching the price spike. This visually confirms the 10-fold increase in retail trading and shows the massive coordinated market event. So in testing the EMH forms, um weak form was violated. The weak worm states that past price and volume data cannot be used to predict future prices. The GameStop event was partially fueled by momentum and more importantly retail investors use publicly available technical data to explicitly cause the price move. The success of this strategy based on public technicals is a clear violation of weak form efficiency. Um semi- strong form was severely violated. This is the core of the analysis. The semi-strong form states that prices adjust quickly and rationally to all publicly available information. So public info was that GameStop's high short interest and Ryan Con's buyin and the entire Wall Street Bets campaign were all public. So the market reaction to that was the price did not move to a rational new equilibrium based on fundamentals. um it exploded to a price to an insane price completely detached from any fundamental value. This was a clear failure of the market to incorporate public information rationally. The price was driven by sentiment and market mechanics which was the squeeze and not fundamentals. So then strong form was also violated since semi- strong form was violated. Strong form is also violated by default. So a behavioral finance finance analysis um this section actually remains as planned in the represent stage as the chart strongly support it. So I will go over briefly um because I've already gone over it. Hurting the price and volume charts are a textbook picture of hurting behavior which is digitally accelerated by social media. Um the limits arbitrage is the key rational expl explanation for why mispricing wasn't fixed. EMH assumes rational investors can short an overvalued stock but here shorting was impossible due to the infinite risk. The short squeeze mechanic created infinite loss potential and micro structure failure. Brokers like Robin Hood halted buying a physical limit to market function that prevented price discovery. So rational investor probability this also remained as planned in the represent stage. Um could irrational investor have systematically profited? Um so this was not a high profitability trade. It was a high-risisk gamble on the behavior of a crowd. Um you're not betting on the fundamentals. You're betting on what you think other people will do. And therefore, while massive profits were made, they were not the kind of systematic risk adjusted returns that EMH defines. It was a one-off behavioral anomaly basically. So, some future improvements that I think could help. Um, the current analysis is strong, but could be evolved for a more rigorous if you were writing like a graduate level paper. Um so I would conduct a um formal event study. I would define event windows around key dates and calculate the cumulative abnormal returns for GameStop against the benchmark and this would statistically prove the magnitude of the semi strong form viol violation. I would also incorporate short interest data. My current analysis relies on the stated fact of 140% short interest. A better implementation would find a historical data set of GameStop short interest and plot it directly against the price to show the relationship visually. A more adv advanced analysis would use natural language processing tools to scrape the Wall Street Bets campaign and quantify investor sentiment hurting and overconfidence and then test if that sentiment was the leading factor of price. further violating the weak semi- strong EMH. So, just some key learnings I've learned um on the GameStop FE as a whole, the GameStop short squeeze is a perfect limit case for the efficient market hypothesis. It demonstrates that while markets might be mostly efficient most of the time, the assumptions of EMH can and do break down spectacularly. Um EMH versus behavioral. The event shows that EMH and behavioral finance are not mutually exclusive. The market was rational in one sense but irrational in another. And the behavioral framework is essential for explaining the cause of the anomaly while the limits to arbitrage framework explains why it wasn't corrected. On the driver process as a whole, um the framework was crucial in this case study. The define the discover stage immediately caught a major factual error in the prompt and without the first step the entire analysis's starting point would have been wrong. The driver sequence ensured that I plan my analysis before coding and then use the code's output to validate my plan which is exactly how like real world quantitative analysis should work. So that is session eight.",
