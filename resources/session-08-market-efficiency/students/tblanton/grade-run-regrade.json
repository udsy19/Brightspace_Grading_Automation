  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates clear, conceptually accurate definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them specifically to GameStop with concrete public-information examples (short interest, Ryan Cohen, WSB) and mechanism explanations (momentum, retail coordination, halts). They also show DRIVER-aligned work (defined objective, planned tests, implemented data checks, reflected on limitations), meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, specified the hypotheses/forms to test, and described concrete validation steps (data source and fact-check). Discovery and representation stages are explicitly present and aligned with the DRIVER framework, meeting the strict requirement for this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit Represent stage: data source, ticker, exact time window, variables, and two concrete plots plus how those visuals will be used to test weak/semi-strong/strong EMH. That level of planning satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit analytical layout, so PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of event-study methodology and cumulative abnormal returns (explicitly describing event windows and CAR). However, they did not implement the event study or show any abnormal-return calculations, statistical tests, or concrete event-window/baseline choices—hence a partial rather than full (thorough) treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and applies specific public-information examples (short interest, Ryan Cohen, WSB) to argue semi-strong failure, but they did not perform quantitative timing or statistical tests (event windows, abnormal returns) to measure how quickly or accurately markets reflected new information. Therefore the treatment is correct and meaningful but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes the event-study/CAR methodology as a planned improvement but provides no explicit code, calculations, event-window specification, or abnormal-return outputs. Under the strict technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of personal execution and block-by-block understanding, the criterion is not met.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Taylor — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently structured problems into Data, Rules, Inputs, Variables, Execution, and Results, and your written explanations translated those pieces into a coherent decision story. Your ability to communicate assumptions and walk a reader through the logic (especially in your recent cash-flow decomposition and scenario write-up) shows real progress from scattered “monkey mind” notes to a methodical analyst’s workflow.\n\nNext steps to level up: treat financial concepts as hypotheses to be tested against business reality. When you build a forecast or valuation, explicitly map each model line back to real-world drivers (customer cohort behavior, pricing levers, working-capital timing). Run simple sensitivity checks and a break-even-style narrative for stakeholders so the numbers tell a clear operational story. For technical implementation, focus on reproducibility and validation rather than lines of code: keep a short assumptions log, create a one-page test plan (what would break the conclusion?), and label the outputs that matter for decision-making. These practices turn your analytic logic into reliable deliverables CFOs trust.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that matters: the habit of breaking complex finance problems into DRIVER components is a career multiplier. As long as you keep pairing that structured thinking with disciplined validation and business-linked narratives, you’ll move from competent analysis to influence. I’m excited to see how you apply this to your next real-world case — treat it as another experiment, and I’ll be here to iterate with you."
