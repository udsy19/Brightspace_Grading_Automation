  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correctly sequenced event-study methodology: choice of benchmark (market model), explicit estimation window, OLS estimation of parameters, computation of abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns, and inference via t-statistics. These concrete methodological choices and implementation notes satisfy the PASS standard under a moderate evaluation lens.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly framed and executed an event-study to assess how quickly and accurately markets reflected new information (defined T0, windows, market-model benchmark, CAR and t-statistics) and drew reasoned conclusions about delayed/incorporated pricing caused by behavioral coordination and arbitrage limits. The combination of methodological detail and interpretive discussion meets the PASS threshold under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student goes beyond basic calculations by implementing careful data preparation (split adjustment), a specified estimation design, and computing CARs, then draws substantive data-driven insights (anti‑leverage, momentum, limits to arbitrage) and connects them to broader theoretical and policy implications. That combination of methodological detail plus interpreted findings meets the PASS standard under the moderate rubric.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct and reasonably detailed understanding and testing of weak and semi-strong EMH (event-study methodology, market model, CAR, findings, and behavioral limits to arbitrage), but does not meaningfully address or provide evidence/testing related to the strong form (insider/private information). That mix of substantive coverage for two forms but omission of the third warrants PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and explains herding/conformity and trend-following dynamics and links them to limits-to-arbitrage, showing meaningful behavioral analysis. However, several specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly discussed or exemplified, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests momentum effects (short-term predictability, momentum windows, anti-leverage) and applies an appropriate event-study method, demonstrating understanding. However, they do not address other specified anomalies (value, size, calendar) nor provide deep quantitative exploration of momentum beyond noting patterns, so the coverage is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Shree — I’ve really enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation. You’ve moved from ad-hoc answers to a clear, repeatable approach: you decompose problems cleanly, make assumptions explicit, and walk through logic in a way that lets others follow and critique your work. In recent assignments you showed particular strength in structuring financial questions into drivers (revenue per user, take rate, churn) and in translating model outputs into plain-language implications — exactly the sort of systematic thinking that separates reactive analysts from strategic finance partners.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on two practical areas that will pay immediate business dividends. First, tighten how you validate and stress-test assumptions: build simple sensitivity tables around 3–5 high-impact drivers (e.g., ARPU, growth rate, CAC) and report the break-even and downside scenarios. This converts model hygiene into board-ready risk insights. Second, strengthen the mapping from model output to decisions: when you present an NPV or scenario, always add a short recommendation (hire, pause, price change) and the top two metrics executives should monitor post-decision (cash runway, contribution margin, or payback period). These steps will deepen your financial judgment and make your analyses actionable in real business contexts.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is cumulative. The habits you’re building (explicit assumptions, driver decomposition, scenario framing) become levers you can reuse across industries and roles. Treat this as an ongoing craft: each case you dissect will make the next one faster, cleaner, and more influential. I’m excited to see where you apply this next — you’re on a trajectory to be the kind of finance partner leaders rely on for clear, decision-focused insight."
