  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student quantifies abnormal returns and lays out an event-study plan, then links the abnormal performance to concrete technological and market factors (Reddit volume spikes, extreme short interest, trading halts and broker actions). Coverage includes multiple supporting examples and a clear explanation of mechanisms driving the abnormal returns, meeting the threshold for thorough conceptual integration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (event, scope, and factual corrections) and articulated the data/assumption questions required before analysis, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. Evidence shows clear ownership of the problem definition and deliberate restriction to the discovery stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission includes an explicit, actionable represent-stage plan listing event/estimation windows, required variables, model choices (CAPM), and planned tests for EMH and behavioral hypotheses, and it connects that plan to implementation (data period and event window). That satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit represent-stage layout even though no separate diagram was provided.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and intends to test weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and uses relevant empirical indicators (abnormal returns, short interest, volume, absence of insider information). However the treatment is more descriptive than thorough: definitions and explicit mapping of evidence to each EMH form are brief or implicit rather than fully developed, so the response demonstrates correct but incomplete understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and plans the key components of an event study and abnormal-return calculations and reports large accumulated abnormal returns, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks thorough methodological detail (explicit formulas, estimation window length, model specification, and statistical test results), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies relevant information flows (social-media spikes, short-interest) and proposes appropriate event-study methods, and reports large abnormal returns consistent with slow/biased information incorporation. However, the submission lacks explicit, quantitative measurement of the speed of incorporation (timing around specific information releases), formal statistical timing tests, and detailed results tying specific information events to immediate price adjustments, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sam — I want to highlight how clearly you’ve moved from scattered intuition to a repeatable process. You’ve shown a real knack for integrating finance and technology: your work tied forecasting logic to measurable data sources, used AI as an execution assistant to speed iterations, and treated code as a guardrail to keep numbers consistent. That combination — linking drivers to outcomes and documenting the chain of reasoning — is exactly the DRIVER transformation I look for: your thinking is becoming structured, traceable, and business-ready.\n\nFor the next steps, focus on three concrete areas that will make your models immediately more persuasive to business partners:\n- Tighten financial assumptions: for each forecast driver, attach an explicit business rationale and a plausible range (best/worst/likely). That makes sensitivity analysis meaningful to FP&A and strategy teams.\n- Strengthen implementation robustness (from a finance-judgment perspective): build simple reproducibility checks — reconciling to prior-period financials, validating unit economics, and flagging outliers in input data. These are what executives trust when they’re making decisions from your outputs.\n- Improve communication for non-technical stakeholders: lead with a one-paragraph executive takeaway, then show 3-5 KPIs that change under alternative scenarios. Practice narrating how an input shock flows through to cash flow and valuation.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that many finance professionals never reach: systematizing judgment so it scales. Keep treating models as communication tools for decisions, not just computations. Over the coming months, focus on those next steps in real business contexts — budgeting cycles, investment memos, or a post-mortem of a forecast — and you’ll see your influence grow. I’m excited to keep coaching you through this journey."
