  "transcript": "Hello, this is my session 8 assignment for financial management. So let's go ahead and get started here. Today we're talking about GameStop, specifically in a short squeeze era. Using market efficiency theory, behavioral finance and rational investor analysis. First, before I get into my results, I wanted to go over my driver kind of prompts. My first prompt was I am beginning to define and discover stage market efficiency investigation using GameStop. 2021 or 2020 to 2021 short squeeze as the event. I wanted to find the analytical problems, including correcting the claim that GME was traded at four cents in August of 2020. Key efficiency questions that I needed to investigate what other data sets were required and what unknowns or assumptions must be clarified before designing an event study approach. Made sure to tell it not to jump to analysis to stay strictly within the define and discover stage. Next I moved on to the represent, so it prompted it as I am now moving to the represent stage of the driver framework based on the define and discover outputs. So I'll get into the actual asking AI this. I just wanted to show my prompts before I went in because there was a lot of text and it'd take a while to scroll through. Everything, but for the represent stage I prompted it as based on the define and discover outputs, help me design an analytical plan studying GameStop's market efficiency. It should include the proposed event windows and estimation window for an event study variables needed. Like returns, abnormal returns, CAPM metrics, volume, short interest, etcetera. Proposed tests for EMH, weak, sem, strong and strong. Behavioral finance hypothesis is to test. Motations or risks and etcetera. Next for the implement stage, I asked that using the represent plan to help me execute the empirical steps gathering historical GameStop prices from August 2020 to. I changed this to August. Of 2022, calculating market returns, computing abnormal returns, identifying event windows and seeing if it kind of was predictable. Next validate. I'm now on the validate stage driver helped me test the robustness and statistical significance of my findings. It should include T tests. Checking sensitivities, alternate with event windows, comparing capital market versus market adjusted returns, verifying data accuracy and correcting false claims and to ensure that this is focused on validation, not interpretation. Next for the evolve stage, based on validated empirical results, help me derive practical implications, what the evidence suggests about EMH form violations, what David implies for rational investor strategies and limits to arbitrage exposed to the GME squeeze. And how behavioral forces interacted with the market. That was a big part of it. And then reflect. I need you to guide me through the driver framework, define, discover, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect for a market efficiency analysis of the 2020 to 2021 GameStop shorter squeeze at each stage only perform what we are currently in. And ask for clarification before moving on. OK, so those are my prompts. I'm gonna take you to this is the summarized version of it. So yeah, we're studying market efficiency. We clarify the analytical problem of verifying facts. Like GME was never traded at four cents in August of 2020, which I pulled from Yahoo Finance. We can see all of the lows for each day of 2020. We'll specifically go to August. Here we can see that looking through this. Stops here. None of these values are at four cents, so it's trading at around $1.50. To a dollar, dollar to $1.50. So that proves the point that it never traded at four cents then. But yeah, so. EMH was kind of relevant. It pretty much. Well, GameStop was traded around $4.00 a share in July of 2028 and searched 1900% in 2021 alone, which was crazy. Here's my tests. It was semi-strong public short interest reached over 130% on the flow and as peak was estimated above 140. 4%, meaning some more shares were shorted than existed. So more people were trying to short it than actual shares there were, which is which is crazy. The thing about insider information explained the price jump for from 20 to over 480. So that just shows that it wasn't really, there was no insider information that would have caused it to jump that much. That's a 2300% increase in two weeks, which is unheard of. Yeah, so we'll go over the timeline. Short interest above 100% existed for months without any major price movement, which is interesting. The stock reacted when Reddit discussion volume increased 20 times during January. At the peak, GameStop's volume hit 100 and ninety-seven million shares more than 15 times its. Flow showing how sentiment, not fundamentals, drove price action, which means pretty much the people investing drove price. It was kind of built around hype in social media. So we'll get into a little bit about the abnormal returns in the event from January 12th to January 28th. GameStop rose from $20 to $480. That's 22 percent, 2200% in 16 days. Using the cap in estimate, normal expected returns would predict maybe 1 to 2% per week, which is not. 2200 which is shows that the cap M didn't really do it. Like it didn't really show it didn't work. During the squeeze period, the accumulated abnormal return exceeded 1500%. After the peak, the price fell 87% in less than two weeks. The boom and bust pattern is. Palladed with efficient pricing. So GameStop was extremely inefficient and it got exploited momentum. So once the stock doubled from 20 to 40, it kind of kept compounding on itself and people kept seeing, oh, GameStop's going higher, higher and higher. So this kind of. Got this crowd-driven kind of hype around it, and it pushed the price all the way to $480, which is unheard of. It's all based off of hype. Yeah, so behavioral biases hurting millions of retailers converged to the same trade. The number of retail brokerage accounts holding GameStop increased by over 400% in a single month. Overconfidence. Many traders believed that they would get rich quickly despite the volatility. Exceeding 600% annualized, which means the market moves a dollar and GameStop moves. What, $600? Which is or not 600, but $6? So it's one to six, which is it's very volatile either way. So the whole narrative behind this was beat Wall Street, beat the hedge funds, all that. So that was kind of also hurting people and this kind of mob mentality of, oh, everybody buy GameStop and short it. Yeah, so. Yeah, limits to arbitrage. GameStop showcased extreme constraints for rational traders. Short sellers lost over $6 billion in the squeeze. Some borrowers fees reached up to 80 to 100% annually. Several funds like Melbourne Capital lost more than 50% of their assets in January alone. Mispricing can persist when arbitrage becomes too risky, and that's exactly what happened. Market microstructure issues. Several structural issues amplified the squeeze on January 28, some brokers restricted buying. This was a big deal, kind of. They took it off the market so you couldn't trade it, which was because they thought people were kind of manipulating the market, which is illegal. So there was profit opportunities. Some early traders turned $1000 into 20,000 and 50,000. More most traders who entered after the spike experience lost it losses. Um, I actually have a. Picture of short squeeze. So all the way up and then all the way down. So the people that bought lost a lot of their money. People shorted, kind of lost some money when it went up like the hedge funds. So that's that was our whole goal was to beat the hedge funds, beat Wall Street. So they all shorted it. Well, um. All the hedge funds shorted it and everybody drove the price up and that pretty much just made the hedge funds lose all their money. Yeah, so the represent stage. Yeah. So we'll go back to here. Yeah, daily price swings are 100 to 150% either way. Multiple days where, like I said, they halted trading, nobody was allowed to buy it. There was no private information at edges, so this wasn't oh, somebody. Somebody had information that nobody else had. It was pretty much people just got lucky. It was like gambling. But you could kind of know because social media played a massive impact in it. If you were in the right groups, you could tell when something was going to happen. OK, EMH versus behavioral finance. The GameStop saga strongly supports behavioral finance models. EMH simply cannot explain the 2000 plus rise in struggling retailer within two weeks. That was another big thing was GameStop wasn't a super. Established brand, they were kind of falling off, they had plateaued and they were going down the deep end. So 2000% rise and that is it can't be explained other than people were buying the hype. But yeah, so wrapping up GameStop short squeeze wasn't just a market event. It was a massive intersection of investor psychology, technology, social coordination, market structure. It challenged classical market theory, validated behavioral finance insights and left lasting implications for traders. Players in financial theory. But yeah, thanks for watching and I hope it made the GameStop event clearer and more meaningful and grounded in real data. So that was all I had. Thank you.",
