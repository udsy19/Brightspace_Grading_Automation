  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission explicitly states the Define & Discover outputs (research question, data needs, assumptions) and directly produces a research-design brief (variables, event/estimation windows, tests), demonstrating clear, actionable understanding of the market-efficiency testing problem. This explicit linkage satisfies the strict DRIVER-framework requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly articulated a concrete represent-stage framework (event and estimation windows, required variables, CAPM metrics, proposed tests) and demonstrated how that framework fed directly into implementation. The represent stage is clearly documented and actionable, meeting the strict requirement for explicit methodology.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, structured workflow from represent to implement to validate: they defined event/estimation windows, gathered multi-year data, calculated abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and linked price/volume/short‑interest evidence while planning statistical robustness checks. These concrete steps and quantitative outputs demonstrate systematic execution of the event-study methodology, satisfying the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual grasp and applies examples (CAPM abnormal returns, lack of insider info, social-media-driven predictability) indicating understanding of weak/semi-strong/strong distinctions, but treatment is high-level and lacks systematic, thorough definitions or comprehensive testing across all EMH forms. Given clear but incomplete coverage, the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of event-study components (data collection, event/estimation windows, abnormal returns, CAPM comparison, robustness checks) and reports accumulated abnormal-return results, but the treatment is high-level without detailed methodology, statistical tests/results, or parameter choices. Given accurate but incomplete execution and lack of thorough statistical reporting, the work is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how new information (social-media discussion, short-interest data) correlated with large, rapid price moves and reports accumulated abnormal returns, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation and timing. However, the treatment is qualitative/high-level and lacks systematic timing tests, formal event-window sensitivity/results, or statistical measures of speed-of-incorporation, so the evidence supports a partial rather than thorough pass.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sam —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve begun to internalize the DRIVER way of thinking. Your work consistently shows careful identification of drivers (you isolate revenue growth, margin, and working-capital drivers cleanly), and your explanations translate those drivers into business consequences—exactly the systematic mapping from assumptions to outcomes we aim for. You’ve also made clear progress in integrating finance and technology: your financial logic flows coherently into the model outputs, and your written explanations walk a reader through the cause-and-effect chain rather than dumping numbers. That clarity—choosing which assumptions matter and articulating why—marks a real shift from “monkey mind” to disciplined, decision-ready analysis.\n\nNext steps to accelerate growth. One remaining technical implementation item needs attention: strengthen your model’s defensive checks and scenario handling. Practically, add simple validation rules (e.g., flag negative operating cash, validate growth rates against historical bounds), and build 2–3 stress scenarios tied to business realities (demand shock, margin compression, capex delay). This will make your models more robust in boardroom conversations and help you surface actionable recommendations for management. Practice explaining how a particular validation rule maps to a real risk the company faces—this ties the technical guardrail back to business consequence.\n\nKeep pushing the DRIVER habit: question assumptions, make the logic explicit, and use AI to automate repetitive checks so you can focus on interpretation. Your systematic thinking is a career multiplier—continue treating modeling as structured storytelling about business choices. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
