You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student explicitly checked each numeric claim from the prompt against the provided historical data and external sources, documented discrepancies (price typo, split adjustment) and corroborated short‑interest and fund‑loss figures with external reports. The verification is specific, data‑driven, and clearly recorded, meeting the requirement for full credit.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies the GME case as examples, showing conceptual awareness and use of data (Discover + Implement). However, the treatment contains inaccuracies and oversimplifications (e.g., conflating short-interest public data with weak-form price-history claims and using hedge-fund losses as definitive disproof of the strong form), so the explanation is correct but incomplete and not fully rigorous — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected and visualized price/volume data and claimed EMH failures, but provided no event‑study methodology (no event window/estimation window, no market model, no abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, and no statistical tests). Because the required methodological steps and abnormal‑return computations are absent, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses information incorporation conceptually (noting public short‑interest data preceded the surge and viral news triggered a rapid reaction), and used data visualization to support observations (Discover + Implement). However, they did not perform a formal timing or accuracy analysis (no event windows, no measures of incorporation speed, no abnormal‑return/statistical testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete — PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Max — I’m really pleased with how your thinking has shifted this term. You’ve moved from patchwork intuitions to a clear DRIVER-style workflow: you framed problems with Decision first, built a repeatable model that Inspects assumptions, and used Validation checkpoints before Reporting. That systematic structure showed up in your scenario analyses and in the way you used AI to automate repetitive checks (excellent example of AI as an execution assistant, not a crutch). Your explanations have become more audience-aware too — you translated model outputs into business language for stakeholders rather than only showing numbers.\n\nNext steps to sharpen impact (practical, business-focused actions):\n- Financial concepts: Two concept areas still need tightening. Revisit timing and recognition in your cash-flow logic (e.g., operating vs. investing flows and mid-year vs. year-end conventions) and the consistent application of a cost-of-capital framework across scenarios. Concrete exercise: rebuild one DCF in three timing conventions and document how valuation moves; use that as a slide for a mock investor Q&A.\n- Technical implementation: One implementation criterion showed fragility. Strengthen your model’s guardrails by codifying key assumptions as named inputs and adding simple assertion checks (e.g., non-negative cash flows, matched currencies). This reduces errors when you hand the model to a finance manager.\n- Integration: Tie model outputs to decision thresholds used in business (IRR hurdle, payback limits, liquidity covenants). Practice by creating a one-page decision memo that says “If X and Y hold, recommend proceeding; else, postpone.”\n\nKeep going — this is a career multiplier. Systematic thinking turns ad-hoc finance work into repeatable, defensible recommendations that managers and investors trust. Treat the next projects as experiments: iterate, document, and let those result-driven habits compound. If you want, we can review one rebuilt DCF together next week."
