  "transcript": "All right, so this is my session video and let's hop into the assignment overview. So we're going to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop, which is ticker symbols GME, uh short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. We're going to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictors, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within existing frameworks. So our critical first step is we're going to verify the statement GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020 against actual historical data. If incorrect document the accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor. So um we have some other points here. We have the invent timeline. So we have August 2020 GME near bankruptcy levels. September 2020 Ryan Cohan Chewy founder acquires 13% stake. January 2021 Reddit um/wall street bets uh driven price surge to $483. February of 2021 congressional hearing on market manipulation and and present postevent price stabilization. We also have some key data points that we will be touching on more on the assignment. So let's just get right into our driver framework. So we're going to use driver analysis um to analyze the GameStop short squeeze and market efficiency um stuff about the market. So first we're going to jump into define discover. though one define the problem. So the objective is to analyze the 2020 to 2021 GameStop GME short squeeze as a case study for market efficiency. Um in this an anal analyst we must verify all state historical data points using the provided data test event against the forms of efficient market hypothesis also known as EMH incor and incorporate behavioral finance explanations. We need to evaluate the potential for systematic rational profit and then we need to use the provided Python code for the analysis. So for the assignment's critical first step um it is to verify the statement the games that GameStop traded at 0.04 in August 2020 uh using the provided data. So the statement um the statement is again GME traded at 0.04 in August 2020. The verdict on the statement is incorrect. Um, we found that using the provided GameStop stock sheet, which is just a file that was taken from Yahoo Finance, um, that included, um, January 1st, 2020 to January 1st, 2022, uh, we found that the actual lowest price GME traded at in August 2020 was $1. So, the professor's 0.04 figure is incorrect. So the communication approach to this is that the professor's data point appears to be a typo and uh this analysis will pro proceed using the verified historical figures from the provide file. So we will just let the professor know that it was a typo. So uh statement um the price surged to $483 in January 2021. So this statement is partially correct but a little bit of a data mismatch. Um the verification for this is the provided CSV file shows a peak high of $120.75 on 2021. Um and um the widely reported $483 was the pre-split intraday high. The data in your files postsplit, so after a 44 for one split in 2022. Um the data is correct, but it's important to note it's posts split. So we'll use the files $120.75 peak. The next statement short interest peaked at 140% of float. The verdict is correct. This statement is correct. Um this data is not in the CSV but is confirmed by external reports from S3 partners and was the central catalyst for the event. And then the last statement um that Melvin's capital sustained 53% loss. This is correct. Um this is also a well doumented external fact uh not present in the price data but crucial for the events context. So now that we know um which statements are correct, we can represent and come with a analytical plan for approaching this situation. So for our technical implementation, we're going to use the approved Python script to load, clean, and sort the GameStop stock sheet. Um, and we're going to generate a two panel plot of price and volume to visually confirm the event. Then we're going to have a market efficiency analysis. Um, and this is going to test the event against the three forms of EMA, EMH, which is weak, semi- strong, and strong. We're also going to have behavioral finance analysis where we're going to identify the key human biases that drove the price. Then we will have a rational profitability analysis where we're going to determine if this was a rational investment or a gamble. So now that we represent and have a plan for analyzing all this, let's go into the implement stage. Um we're first going to uh look at the technical analysis with a Python imple imple implementation. Um this code reads your um our GameStop sheet file and cleans the data and plots the price and volume on charts to see. And the prompt we use is that um um we use have it uh read this Excel sheet with the Yahoo finance data to get the data and then successfully create Python code for price data analysis. Have it explain what the output means and keep it simple, not over complicated. So using this data um we got the uh code from Google Gemini and then put it in Google Collab. So here on the steps you can see it uses the pan pandas python library. It then uses um data cleaning to fix the column names convert um some of the column um to uh actual objects and then it sorts um the um data by date in reverse order. And then it basically has code for plotting it. So this output gives us two charts. Um um one um has the price USD on the xax or the y- axis and the other has the volume on the y- axis and both are the x is the dates. So from 2020 um month of September all the way up or January all the way up. So what what does this plot tell us about gametock stock? So this plot shows two main things about GameStop stock over time. The top part with the stock price um also known as closing price. Um the line given shows how the price of one share of GME changed each day when the market closed. When the line goes up, the price went up and then when it goes down, the price went down. So looking at this line helps us see the stock's history and if it's generally going up, down or staying around the same. Now the bottom part shows how much the stock was traded. the volume. These bars show how many shares of GME were bought and sold each day. Uh taller bars mean a lot of shares were traded that day and shorter bars mean fewer shares were traded. And high volume often happens when something important is happening with the stock like big news or a lot of people are interested in buying or selling. So now we're going to put it all together. So what it means for looking at prices. So prices move with interest. When the price goes up or down a lot, look at the volume. If the volume is also high, it means a lot of people were buying or selling, which makes that price move more important. Busy times. So big uh spikes in both the price and volume tell us um there were very busy and often exciting or stressful times for the stock. This is where major events likely happen. Understanding the energy volume helps us understand the energy behind a price change. A small price change on huge volume is different from a small price change on tiny volume. So um to think about all this uh think of it like this. The price is what the stock did and the volume is how much people cared about doing it. Analyzing both together gives us a better picture of the stock story. This is a simple look and is financial advice. Um so now let's go to our other analysis now that we can see the stock in volume and this kind of uh uses all this data and tests some stuff. So market efficiency testing the GME event violated all three forms of efficient market hypothesis. So the weak form failed. Um this form says past data like price can't predict future moves. It failed because retail investors use public historical short interest data at 140% to predict the squeeze. The semi-rong form failed um because the form says all public news is priced in. It failed because the 140% short interest was public for months yet the market ignored it. Then when the news went viral, the market overreacted with a hyped driven price $120 far beyond fundamentals. The strong form failed. Um this form says even smart money can't break the market. It failed because smart money hedge funds like the Melvin Capital was spectacularly lo uh wrong, lost billions and was beaten by retail crowd. So now let's go to the behavioral finance analysis. So if the market wasn't rational, it was behavioral driven by human psych logology. So hurting uh bandwagon effect. So people bought GME because they uh saw others on uh Wall Street Bets doing it. It became a social movement, us versus them kind of narrative rather than an individual investment. Um there's confirmation bias. So investors focus only on posts that confirm their to the moon belief ignoring all the other fundamental data that showed that uh the stock was dangerously overvalued and then limits to our arbitrage uh market failure uh rational traders couldn't stop the bubble shorting was too risky infinite losses and trading platforms like Robin Hood uh broke the market's mechanics by halting buying. Now lastly, the rational profitability analysis um shows that it was a gamble, not a rational investment. A rational investor buys based on the company's future earnings. No one believed GME's earnings justified a $1 to $20 price. People bought at the peak were speculating, not investing. They were betting they could sell to a greater fool at a higher price before the bubble burst. This was not a systematic repeatable strategy. So now that we've seen the imple implement stage, let's uh verify validate everything. So data code verified, the Python code uh we successfully ran and the resulting plot verifies the core event by visually confirming the simul uhacious uh explosive spike in both price and volume. EMH failure verified. The failure of all three EMH forms is verified. The squeeze was predicted from the past data a week and the market overreacted to to public news which is why semi-strong failed and smart money was proven wrong which is why strong failed. So the conclusions verified um all findings are logically consistent. The EMH failures verifies that a behavioral explanation is necessary and that the vent was a speculative gamble not a rational investment. So what's this all result in? What's the what's the final conclusion? So the final conclusion is that the GameStop event is a perfect case study of how markets are not always rational. It clearly shows that the efficient market hypothesis can fail. The price driven uh was driven not by efficient an analysis of data but by human behavioral factors like hurting and hype and market structure failures uh like limits to abbit rage, arbitrage. Um so overall this event proves that market sentiment is not just noise but can be a powerful price moving force. So thank you for listening to this assignment. Um that is our analysis of uh GameStop stock and the short squeeze event of 2021 or of 2020 into 2021. Hope you enjoy it. Have a good day.",
