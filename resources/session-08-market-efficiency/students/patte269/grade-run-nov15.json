  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates clear conceptual definitions of all three EMH forms, applies them empirically via an event study, and interprets results specific to each form with supporting examples (momentum, public-news reactions, early investors). Coverage is detailed and connects theory to data and limitations, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specifies a clear event-study design (estimation and event windows), implements proper AR/CAR calculations using log returns and a CAPM market model, and interprets empirical patterns with appropriate caveats. Coverage is detailed and applied to multiple events, meeting the threshold for a thorough, competent treatment under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames information incorporation via the semi-strong EMH, implements an appropriate event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, log returns, CAPM predicted returns, AR/CAR), and interprets results in terms of speed and accuracy of market response across multiple events. Coverage applies the DRIVER stages and provides applied examples and interpretation, meeting the threshold for a thorough, moderate-standard treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several key biases (herding, overconfidence, confirmation bias/FOMO, and the disposition effect as loss-aversion related) to explain the GME dynamics, but anchoring and mental accounting are not explicitly addressed and the discussion is relatively brief. Coverage is accurate but incomplete and lacks the depth and multiple detailed examples needed for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and empirically tests momentum/reversal effects using an event-study and AR/CAR methodology, showing applied understanding. However, value, size, and calendar anomalies are not discussed or analyzed, and the treatment lacks multiple anomaly examples or deeper coverage, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student computes AR and CAR and interprets cumulative-return behavior across multiple event windows, showing applied understanding. However, there is no explicit demonstration of visualization artifacts (plots, labeled figures, or discussion of visual design) or multiple plotted examples; the description is summary-level rather than a thorough visual presentation, so the work meets a correct but incomplete treatment.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jake —\n\nI’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER way of thinking. In your recent assignment you didn’t just produce working code — you framed assumptions clearly, structured your model so each driver mapped to a business outcome, and explained the logic behind each step in plain language. That clarity of thought — turning a messy problem into a sequence of defensible decisions — is exactly the systematic thinking we aim to cultivate.\n\nFor your next steps, treat the model as a decision-making tool rather than an end product. Three practical actions:\n- Add sensitivity and scenario layers tied to business triggers: identify the 3–4 inputs that would change a go/no-go decision (volume, price, margin, capex) and show breakpoints. This makes the model actionable for a CFO facing trade-offs.\n- Quantify and communicate uncertainty: run a simple Monte Carlo or range analysis and summarize results as confidence bands or probabilities so non-technical stakeholders can weigh risk.\n- Translate outputs into recommended actions: build a one-page executive summary that states the decision, the key drivers, and recommended contingencies (e.g., “If margin falls below X, pause expansion”).\n\nKeep leaning on DRIVER: let code guard the logic, not drive your reasoning, and use AI as an execution partner to accelerate iteration. The systematic habits you’re forming — making assumptions explicit, linking drivers to decisions, and communicating implications — are rare and high-value in finance. Stay curious; each model you build will sharpen your judgment and make you a more persuasive business partner. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
