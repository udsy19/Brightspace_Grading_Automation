  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Aly and this is my analysis of the GameStop short squeeze using the driver framework. So, in order to do that, we want to determine whether or not markets are efficient by using the efficient market hypothesis or EMH to determine that stock prices should reflect all available information, meaning that no investor can consistently earn unusual returns. However, we have seen that the GME's price rose from about 1.67 to a high of 483 in January of 2021 and at start August 2020. So, this project tests whether or not these adjustments violated weak form, semi- strong or strong form market efficiency. So, the key questions are was the statement GME traded at 0.04 or 4 cents in August 2020 accurate? How did GME's price react to public information such as Ryan Cohen's stake? Did prices adjust quickly and rationally or did they overreact and could rational investors earn systematic profits? So, in order to do that, we use the data that was provided. So, the timeline is January January 2020 to February 2021. And in August 2020, we saw the near bankruptcy rumor. September 2020, Ryan Cohen buys 13% stake. January 2021, Cohen joins a GME board. And in January, the late January 2021, Reddit and WSB squeeze and trading restrictions. So from there, the plan is to first verify the data accuracy. So confirm the August 2020 price range from 1.04 to 1.67 67 and then document the correction to that claim. Then second we are going to collect data. Um so pull the GME and S&P returns and then mark dates. So identify the critical events meaning co and stake board news and restrictions. And then from there we're going to compute abnormal returns. So AR is the actual minus expected return. And then also analyze patterns. So we're going to check whether or not AR and CAR CR are different from zero. Then finally we will interpret and validate by comparing observed behavior versus EMH predictions and visualized findings. So generating graphs and charts for visualization. So from there, I put all of that into Gemini and then into Collab and got this output. So the first step was to fact check a common claim, which was GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. So using that data, I verified that the actual adjusted price range was 1.0. 4 to 1.67 which was split adjusted and closing at 1.67 on August 31st. So that statement was off by it says about 40 times meaning that the GameStop stock was extremely low but not near zero. So I documented this correction I feel pretty clearly so that all of the later analysis had accurate data. And for the communication approach it says professor I verified the stated claim that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020 sorry in August 2020 against historical data. So the actual closing price was $167 on August 31st with a monthly range of $14 to $167. So I have documented this correction and adjusted my analysis accordingly while maintaining the core research question. So from there I built my timeline um that in August 2020 prices near bankruptcy levels. September Ryan Cohen stake disclosure. January of 2021 is Reddit driven search to $483 here. And then in February, the trading restrictions and congressional hearings. And then from there, I have the um the represent. So to represent this problem, I used an event study approach. which was grounded by the CAPM model. So it uses a 200 day estimation window and this window covers about 5 days before and after the event. So here it shows oh 250 trading day estimation window and then it shows that the event window is 60 days between December 2020 and February 2021. And then the benchmark was the market index the S&P 500. So I tested the different forms being weak form, semi- strong and strong form. So weak form asks like can past prices predict future returns. Semi-rong form asks do prices instantly reflect the public information? in strong form usually asks can insiders or the investors that know um profit systematically and then for implement um I ran the automated event study pipeline. So for each event like Ryan Cohen's filing it calculates the AR and cumulative AR. So the C r or car and as we can see here um where is it here it is the car jumps dramatically right after that initial surge and around the restriction date, which already demonstrates that prices don't fully reflect the public information right away. So, going back up. I also ran a t test. So, T+1 buy and hold back test. So even though some of these windows looked profitable, it shows that once you account for the different cost and volatility that it may not necessarily be reliable for profits. And then now I have to find my validation. Okay. So to validate the these results I ran both um parametric and nonparametric tests and then so these show that the price data correction is $167 not just the 4 cents And all statistical tests are significant. So the P is less than 0.05. So there will be no systematic profit for rational investors. And this limits to arbitrage prevented market correction. And then the theoretical implications are markets are eventually efficient not always efficient and behavioral factors dominate during extreme events. And then for integration between the finance and technology um automated event study methodology systematic hypothesis testing so the five tests that were down here. So this shows the trading volume. So the different trading volumes between the start and end dates. and then the cumulative abnormal returns that we looked at. This is the price versus fundamental value and then the daily abnormal return. So this shows that the mean is 2.86%. I don't know why it just zoomed in. So for reflect I saw tha the weak form EMH was violated because prices showed strong um autocorrelation and it was very predictable. So there was a P of 0.7071. The semi- strong was also violated because public short interest and co-en stake weren't completely reflected um which showed an AR of 2.86% and a p value of less than 0.001 which is obviously very close to zero. And then finally the strong form was also violated because um even the hedge funds that we saw lost about I think it said 53% and needed what they called a bailout. So overall um the note for the professor was that historical price corrected from 0.04 so 4 cents to the $167 and all other data points were verified against sources. So this means that the GameStop event showed that markets are not always efficient especially under conditions of social distress or coordination and even behavioral biases. Um however markets do remain eventually efficient like this said and as we saw prices stabilized back to near fundamental values. So here it went way up and then started to stabilize. And then my biggest takeaway is that behavioral finance um and limits to arbitrage don't contradict the EMH, but instead they serve as an explanation for the short-term um kind of like distress or movements in the markets while also showing us that prices tend to settle back toward rational um levels over time. Thank you.",
