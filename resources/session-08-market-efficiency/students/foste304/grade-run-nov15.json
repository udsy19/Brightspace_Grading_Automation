  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, implements an event-study with statistical tests, and cites specific results (autocorrelation, AR, p-values) when interpreting violations, demonstrating applied conceptual understanding. Although the strong-form evidence could be argued as less rigorous, the overall treatment is detailed, uses multiple examples/tests, and meets the moderate standard for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes the event-study design (estimation/event windows, CAPM benchmark), implemented it in code, and performed statistical validation (t-tests, nonparametric tests, reported p-values), demonstrating both methodological understanding and applied execution. This combination of conceptual detail, implementation evidence, and statistical validation meets the threshold for a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student designed and implemented an event-study (estimation/event windows, CAPM benchmark), computed ARs/CARs for specific public events (e.g., Cohen filings), and performed statistical validation (t-tests, nonparametric tests with reported p-values). They interpret timing (CAR jumps after events, T+1 tests) and draw conclusions about semi-strong efficiency, demonstrating thorough, applied treatment of information incorporation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes behavioral explanations and connects them to event-study results, showing applied awareness (Implement + Reflect). However, they do not discuss or apply specific biases (overconfidence, anchoring, herding, loss aversion, mental accounting) or provide examples/mechanisms, so the treatment is correct but too high-level to merit a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student detects and interprets autocorrelation (a momentum-style anomaly) using an implemented event-study, demonstrating partial coverage. However, they do not address other listed anomalies (value, size, calendar) or provide multiple anomaly tests/applications, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates personal execution (ran the pipeline, set estimation/event windows, computed AR/CAR) and performed statistical validation, showing partial technical capability. However, under the strict criterion they did not provide block-by-block explanations (e.g., how beta/expected returns were estimated, risk-free rate used, regression details, code walkthrough) or explicit ownership of methodological steps, so the submission falls short of a full PASS.",

I want to call out two concrete strengths I saw: first, the way you married finance concepts with tooling — you translated a messy forecasting problem into a structured scenario matrix and tied each scenario back to clear cash-flow drivers. Second, your explanations were exceptional: your walkthroughs of assumptions, your annotated outputs, and the way you framed trade-offs made it easy for a non-technical stakeholder to follow the logic. That clarity is a rare and powerful skill in finance.\n\nFor next steps, focus your computational thinking more tightly around implementation guardrails that support business decisions. Practically, that means:\n- Design simple input validation and scenario templates so stakeholders can run “what-if” analyses without breaking the model.\n- Build a small suite of sanity checks (e.g., growth bounds, margin consistency, reconciliation to historicals) so outputs are immediately trustworthy for FP&A or capex decisions.\n- Translate sensitivity results into actionable recommendations: which levers to prioritize for cash preservation, pricing, or investment under different market states.\n\nThese moves aren’t about writing clever code; they’re about making your models reliable and decision-ready for real finance use cases like budgeting, valuation, and risk management.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution partners while you codify the logic that matters. You’re on a path from clever analyses to dependable financial decision frameworks — keep iterating. I’m excited to see where this systematic thinking takes your career."
