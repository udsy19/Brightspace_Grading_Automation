  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applied multiple empirical checks (autocorrelation for weak form; event-timing/price response for semi-strong; short-interest/limits-to-arbitrage for strong form). The analysis is case-specific, uses implemented tests, and draws clear, supported conclusions, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (objective, hypotheses, data source, key events, and planned analyses), meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. This level of specificity enables reproducibility and satisfies the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out the analysis plan: objective, data source (Yahoo Finance), ordered key events, and specific diagnostics/tests to evaluate weak and semi-strong efficiency. This clear, reproducible plan satisfies the strict Represent requirement for a pass.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-timing analysis and empirical diagnostics (price/event overlays, volatility, autocorrelation) showing conceptual understanding of testing market reaction. However, they did not perform or describe formal event‑study procedures (estimation window, benchmark/m​arket model, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained the expected rapid information incorporation under the semi-strong EMH and used event-timed price/volume/volatility plots to evaluate market response, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform formal event-study calculations (estimation window, benchmark model, abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student did not perform or describe any formal abnormal-return calculations (no market model/benchmark, estimation window, abnormal or cumulative abnormal return formulas, code execution, or statistical inference). They rely on plots and qualitative statements about \"abnormal\" returns without explicit, owned implementation, so under the strict technical standard this criterion fails.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Colin — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. Your work demonstrates concrete strengths: you consistently frame the decision problem before modeling, you enumerate constraints and assumptions up front, and your scenario logic maps cleanly to expected cashflow outcomes. That clarity — turning an ambiguous business question into a stepwise analysis — is exactly the “systematic thinking” we aim to develop.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two targeted areas to deepen impact. First, tighten a couple of the financial concept touchpoints you’re already progressing on: be explicit about your choice of discount rate (link it to a clear cost of capital or comparable market rate) and reconcile how taxes and capital expenditures flow through to free cash flow in each scenario. Second, address the remaining technical implementation gap by adding validation checks and sensitivity runs that tie directly to business KPIs — for example, automated break-even tests for leverage levels, or a tornado chart showing which assumptions move NPV or IRR most. These are small model guardrails with big payoff when presenting to investors or management.\n\nKeep going — systematic thinking is a career multiplier. The habit of decomposing decisions, documenting assumptions, and linking model outputs to business outcomes will make your analyses persuasive and operationally useful. Treat this as an iterative craft: each model you build should be slightly more robust and more tied to the decision it’s meant to inform. If you’d like, bring your next version to office hours and we’ll walk through which validation checks to add and how to frame the key assumptions for stakeholders."
