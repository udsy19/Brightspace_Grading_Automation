  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Isaac and this is my video presentation for session 8, market efficiency and behavioral finance. My analysis will focus on the GameStop short squeeze event, which I've investigated using the driver framework to test the very foundations of market efficiency. On my agenda today, I'll first introduce the scenario, the 2021 GameStop event, where a retail stock defied all traditional financial models. My objective is to analyze this anomaly by testing the efficient market hypothesis or EMH against observable market data. And to do this, I will be following the six-step driver framework, moving sequentially from discover and represent through implementation and validation and concluding with the evolve and reflect. Starting with the discover stage, the core of this assignment is a conflict between two major financial theories. On one side, we have the efficient market hypothesis, which states that all available information is already reflected in the stock's price. In this view, GME's price should have been near its fundamental value, which analysts place between 10 and $40. On the other side, we have behav behavioral finance which argues that human psychology biases like hurting and overconfidence can create massive irrational bubbles. My financial objective is to systematically analyze the GMA event to determine first if market efficiency was violated and if so, which form. Second, what behavioral biases can explain the price action? And third, why why limits to arbitrage prevented rational investors from correcting this clear mispricing. The assignment includes a critical first step which is to verify a specific data point from the prompt. The cla the claim was that GameStop traded at 4 cents in August of 2020. My first analytical action was to verify this against historical data from Yahoo Finance. My finding is that this claim is incorrect. The actual split adjusted low for GameStop in 2020 was approximately $4 per share. The 4 cents claim was likely an error based on pre-split data as GameStop conducted a 41 split in 2022. This diligence is critical as my entire analysis must be based on correct verified historical data which is what I'll be using from this point forward. Now in the represent stage I will outline my analytical plan. First I need to acquire the historical price and volume data for both GameStop GME and the market benchmark. I've chosen the S&P 500 ticker SPY to represent the market's expected return. Second, I will plot this data to visually identify the anomaly and confirm that claims confirm the claims from the prompt. Third, and most importantly, I will conduct a market efficiency test based on calculating the abnormal return or AR. This will allow me to quantify the inefficiency. And finally, I will use these outputs to test the three forms of the me and identify the behavioral factors at play. My analysis is built on two foundational concepts from our textbook. First are the three forms of efficiency market hypothesis. Weak form states that past price and volume data have no predictive power. Semi-rong form states that price reflects all publicly available information and strong form states that prices reflect all public and private information. To test this, I am using the abnormal return AR formula which is AR= R minus ER. My input my inputs are simple and powerful. The actual return R is the daily percentage of sorry the daily percentage change of GME and the expected return ER is the daily percentage change from the S&P 500 SPY. In an efficient market the abnormal rate sorry the abnormal return should average to zero. In an inefficient bubble we would expect to see large sustained positive abnormal returns. This is the hypothesis that I will test in my implementation. I'm now in the implement stage which I used Google Collab and Python coding. My first block of code is for data acquisition. The financial logic is to pull all the raw data I planned for in the represent stage. The code itself is pretty straightforward. I import the Y finance pandas and mattplot lib libraries. I define my tickers GMA and spy and my data range. Then I use the yf.d download function. It's imp it's important to note as I discovered during my analysis that Y finance now defaults to auto adjust equals true. This means the close column it provides is already the correct split and dividend adjusted price. Therefore, I'm selecting the close column for my prices and the volume column for volume. After running the code, you can see the output on the right hand side. The data has was sorry has loaded correctly. The prices head output shows the split adjusted GME price from August 2020 starting around $13 which confirms my finding from the discover stage. Next, I will visualize the anomaly. The financial logic here is to create a visual confirmation of the event before I quantify it. My code uses the map plot lib to create a figure with two subplots. The plot X1 will show GME's adjusted closing price and the bottom plot AX2 will show its trading volume. I've also I've also highlighted the key squeeze period in red for clarity. After running the code again, you can see the output on the right. The plots will be analyzed in the validate stage. Um, you can also see that the code has printed a key statistic, the verified peak price from that period, which my code calculated to be $86.88. This final implementation step is the most critical. I'm now executing the test that I designed in the represent stage. The final logic logic is to calculate the plot sorry calculate and plot the abnormal return a r= r minus r um and that's r gma minus the rspy. My code does this in three steps. First I use the pct_ch change function to calculate the daily returns for both GMA and spy. Second, I create a a new abnormal return column by simply subtracting the spy return from the GME return. And finally, I plot these abnormal returns and also print key statistics for that squeeze period. After the code is executed, you can see in the outputs on the right, it has calculated the returns in the AR and it has printed the statistics which are frankly outst astounding astounding. I will now move to the validate stage to analyze these outputs in detail. We are now in the validate stage. This is the first chart on my Python code generated. The analysis is crystal clear here. On the top plot, you can see that the price of GME was flat, trading for just a few dollars through all of 2022. Then in January 2021, the squeeze window, the price explodes in a par parabolic curve, reaching the $86.88 split adjusted peak that my code verified. You can see here on the bottom plot, the volume perfectly mirrors this, confirming the assignment's claim of a t-fold increase. Volume goes from negligible to massive spikes, confirming this was a high participation trading driven event. The second chart is like the smoking gun of my entire analysis. This is the abnormal return plot generated by my code. First look at the black dashed line at zero. As you can see here, this line represents the efficient market hypothesis prediction. In an efficient market, the purple line should just be random noise around this black line. Now look at the purple line. This is the observed reality that my code calculated for most of the 5-year period. It does look like noise. But inside the red squeeze box which you can see here reality and theory completely diverge. The purple line explodes upwards. This is a massive stained positive abnormal return and it is definitive proof of market inefficiency. More importantly my code quantified this. The mean AR during the squeeze was 9.9%. This means on average day during that period, GME beat the market by nearly 10%. The max AR was 137.3%. My analysis found that on its peak day, GameStop's return was 137% higher than the return predicted by the market. This is the quantitative undeniable evidence that the market was not rational. So to answer the question, which form of market efficiency was violated? My analysis based on the codes output concludes that all three forms here were actually violated. First of all, we have weak form which was violated. The weak form says that past price and volume can't predict future returns. My AR chart shows the exact opposite. a clear momentum pattern where past positive returns did predict future positive returns. Next up, we have the semi- strong form which was also violated. This is the clearest violation. The market completely ignored all rational public information like analyst reports valuing the stock at $10 to $40 and instead priced the stock based on a social media sentiment. Third and last we have the strong form which was violated. This form says that even private information is reflected in the price. Here the coordinated sentiment and buying plans on the R wall street bets forum acted as a collective private information set. This group had an information advantage and profited from it before the broader market could react. This is a classic strong form violation. In the evolve stage, we ask why and look at the broader implications of the analysis. First, could a rational investor have profited? The answer here is no. This event is a classic example of limits to arbitrage. A rational investor would have shorted this stock at $50, $100, or $200. But as the hedge fund Melvin Capital learned, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. They were forced to capsulate and buy back at massive losses. This entire event is only explainable through behavioral finance. My analysis identified hurting. This was a textbook case of a retail investors following the crowd on our Wall Street bets. Next, we have overconfidence. This group genuinely believed they could overestimate their abilities and forced a squeeze. And last, we have loss aversion. This is what forced the short the short sellers to capulate. The acute pain of their mounting losses forced them to buy back at any price, which is what completed the squeeze. Finally, in the reflect stage, I will conclude with my key learnings and a summary of my process. This assignment required me to follow the driver framework sequentially, and this process was critically was critical to my findings. My discover stage began with data verification where I corrected a factual error in the prompt establishing a solid foundation. My represent my represent stage laid out the financial logic building my analysis around the abnormal return formula for from our textbook. My implement stage which I used Google Collab and Python was where I executed this plan. My code successfully downloaded the data, navigated a change in the Y fin Finance library, and then calculated the exact quantitative proof that I needed. My validate stage used these code inputs, the charts, and the statistics to prove the abnormal return reached 137%. And that all three forms of the EMH were indeed violated. and my evolve stage connected this data to why identifying the behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage that made this anomaly possible. My final takeaway is that while markets are mostly efficient, there are complex systems run by humans. And as this case study proves, behavioral finance is a critical tool for understanding real world events where human psychology can and does overpower rational fundamental analysis.
