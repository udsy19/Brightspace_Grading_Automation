  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the testing problem, objectives, timeline, data-verification step, and the set of analyses to be performed, and specifies key variables—meeting strict requirements for Define & Discover. The plan is clear and actionable, so this criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student lays out a clear, actionable analytical framework—defined variables, explicit tests to run, event window, and required visual/output artifacts—satisfying the Represent stage's expectations for an explicit methodology. This plan is concrete and defensible, meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the analysis framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow: defined the problem, specified variables and event window, acquired and processed data, computed summary statistics, identified abnormal days, and produced visual graphs with interpretive discussion. Although not fully exhaustive (e.g., formal AR/CAR model details), the implementation shows organized, methodical execution of the event-study steps required for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and applies these concepts to the GME event, verifies data, and discusses behavioral and market-structure explanations. However, treatment is high-level and stops short of a thorough, explicit classification or rigorous tests showing which specific EMH form was violated; thus the work demonstrates solid understanding but is not sufficiently comprehensive for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates basic components of an event-study approach (data sourcing, return calculation, selection of an abnormal window) and computes summary return statistics, so conceptual understanding is present. However, they do not show a thorough event-study methodology: no clear benchmark/market-model for expected returns, no explicit abnormal-return formula, no cumulative abnormal returns or statistical significance testing—therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how new information (social coordination, stake disclosures, trading restrictions) related to price movement and provides concrete GME examples, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they do not perform explicit, time‑based tests or quantitative measures of speed/accuracy (no formal intraday/short-window reaction analysis or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Brock — I’m really pleased with how you’re growing into a DRIVER thinker. You’ve moved from piecemeal answers to deliberate decomposition: your recent deliverable clearly broke a business problem into hypothesis → drivers → metrics, and you walked through the sensitivity of revenue drivers rather than treating revenue as a black box. Your written explanations were concise and tied to finance concepts (present value logic, margin drivers), which shows real progress in translating theory into actionable analysis. I also noticed you used AI thoughtfully to iterate scenarios rather than to shortcut your thinking — that’s exactly the mindset we want.\n\nNext steps to push this further: focus on tightening the technical guardrails that support your finance logic. Practically, translate your scenario work into reproducible steps a CFO could rerun: explicit input tables for assumptions, simple validation rules (e.g., check negative cash flows where not expected), and a short “how to change assumptions” guide. Work on one DRIVER criterion that still needs attention — problem framing before jumping into computation. Before you model, write one-sentence business hypotheses (e.g., “If discount rate rises by 200 bps, EBITDA margin will decline x%”) and sketch the causal chain. In business settings this makes your analyses easier to defend in meetings and faster for stakeholders to act on.\n\nKeep treating code and tools as guardrails, not goals. The most valuable skill you’re building is systematic financial thinking: that lets you turn messy business questions into repeatable insights. Stay curious, iterate on the small reproducible artifacts I suggested, and keep using AI as an execution assistant. This is a career-long journey — each structured analysis you produce will compound into clearer, faster decisions for whatever finance role you take next. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
