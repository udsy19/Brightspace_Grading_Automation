  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly described and implemented an event-study framework, computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and performed statistical and robustness checks—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of market-efficiency testing. Coverage is specific and methodical enough to meet PASS under the moderate rubric.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly operationalized information incorporation (event-day vs post-event drift), implemented abnormal-return and CAR calculations, and validated results with robustness checks—demonstrating a thorough, applied treatment of how quickly/accurately markets reflected new information. This meets PASS under the moderate rubric.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student moved beyond basic AR math by integrating multiple data sources (price, volume, short interest), applying alternative factor models, and performing robustness checks—yielding substantive insights (e.g., extreme short interest, volume spikes, behavioral drivers) rather than a single calculation. This breadth and the evolved interpretation meet the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies a clear, appropriate event-study test for the semi-strong form (with implemented CAPM/abnormal-return analysis). However, treatment of the weak and strong forms is brief and not empirically tested or explored in depth, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and connects behavioral forces (herding, FOMO, hindsight bias) to the GME episode and uses empirical signals (volume, short interest) and personal reflection to illustrate them. However, treatment is partial: several listed biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, overconfidence) are not explicitly analyzed or exemplified in depth, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied appropriate factor models (Fama–French three-factor and Carhart momentum) and robustness checks, showing awareness of size, value, and momentum adjustments. However, they did not explicitly analyze or discuss calendar anomalies or provide in-depth interpretation of how each anomaly (momentum, value, size, calendar) affected results, so treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kevin — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a clear, repeatable approach. You consistently structure finance problems the DRIVER way: you frame the decision clearly, lay out assumptions up front, and walk through scenarios instead of jumping to a number. I noticed you used logic guardrails to keep the model honest (explicit assumptions, stepwise calculations, and sanity checks), and you made good use of AI as an execution assistant to surface alternative scenarios rather than as a crutch. Those are concrete signs your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical growth areas that will pay off in real business settings. First, tighten some of your financial concept translations into the model — when you convert an operational metric into a cash-flow line, add a reconciliation to the income statement and balance sheet so a CFO can trace every number. Second, strengthen robustness and decision-readiness: build a small sensitivity matrix for key drivers, document the business implications of each scenario (e.g., breakeven sales, IRR thresholds), and include a short executive summary with recommended actions under each outcome. These are the kinds of deliverables that convert analysis into decisions in budgeting, investment appraisal, and strategic planning.\n\nKeep treating analysis as a repeatable discipline. Systematic thinking will differentiate you in finance roles — it reduces rework, speeds decisions, and builds trust. You’re on a trajectory; keep iterating your DRIVER checklist, and you’ll convert thoughtful models into real business impact. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
