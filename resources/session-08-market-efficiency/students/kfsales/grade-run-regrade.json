This shows concept understanding plus applied examples and validation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes and applies an event‑study methodology: specified event windows, constructed a baseline via CAPM regression, calculated abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, ran statistical tests, and conducted multiple robustness checks including alternative factor models and estimation windows. These concrete implementation and validation steps demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meriting PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined an event‑study test for information incorporation, implemented it by estimating expected returns (CAPM), computing abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, ran statistical and robustness checks, and concluded prices drifted post‑event indicating delayed incorporation. These concrete methodological and validation steps demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly describes and claims to have executed abnormal‑return calculations (CAPM regression, expected returns, abnormal returns, CARs) and performed validation checks, demonstrating substantive technical work. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑level code explanation, explicit \"I ran this code and verified...\" ownership details, or a detailed stepwise implementation flowchart — therefore PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kevin — I want to highlight how clearly your thinking has shifted from scattershot ideas to a repeatable, finance-first process. Your work consistently applies core valuation logic (cash-flow thinking, discount-rate tradeoffs) and you tie risk-return intuition to concrete financial statements. I also noticed how you used technology as an execution assistant — automating repetitive calculations and structuring outputs so decision rules are obvious. Most importantly, you followed the DRIVER steps every time: you defined the decision, identified required inputs, validated assumptions, routed logic into modular components, executed scenarios, and reflected on results. That systematic approach is exactly what separates ad-hoc analysis from decision-grade finance.\n\nFor next steps, focus on turning that clear logic into reliable, business-ready artifacts. Translate your models into reproducible workflows that stakeholders can trust: create a standard input sheet with guardrails for key assumptions, build sensitivity and stress-test templates tied to realistic business scenarios (e.g., revenue shocks, margin compression), and document decision rules so non-technical managers can audit the logic. In practice this means producing one-page decision memos that link model outputs to recommended actions (pricing change, capex delay, hedging). These are small, high-leverage steps that make your analyses actionable for a CFO or product leader.\n\nKeep treating thinking as the product. Systematic methods make you faster, reduce debate, and amplify impact. Over time you’ll move from producing correct answers to shaping better business choices — and that influence is what will power your career. I’m excited to see where you take this."
