  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission clearly defines the market-efficiency testing problem and lays out a concrete research design (steps, hypotheses, and event timeline) and verifies core data inputs. Although not exhaustively detailed (e.g., no estimation windows given), the required Define & Discover stage is explicitly and coherently demonstrated, satisfying the strict criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly contrasts EMH predictions with behavioral explanations (retail herding, noise trading, arbitrage failure) and draws clear reflective conclusions about EMH’s limits and market fragility, demonstrating an integrated synthesis. The treatment is coherent and grounded in the case evidence, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the three EMH forms to the GameStop case and provides concrete examples (weak: coordinated retail trading; semi-strong: price diverging from analyst targets; strong: potential insider/private advantages). However the treatment is cursory, often hedged, and lacks deeper analysis or rigorous evidence to fully justify conclusions, so the work meets a correct but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student sets up an EMH/event-study question and verifies factual data, but nowhere describes or performs event-study methodology (event/window selection, benchmark model, estimation window) or reports abnormal return calculations. Discussion remains descriptive rather than providing the required methodological steps or quantitative abnormal-return results, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses how public information vs. market prices (semi-strong EMH) appears not to have been reflected, using concrete examples (analyst targets, price peak, short interest). However, the treatment is qualitative and lacks explicit timing analysis, metrics, or quantitative measures of how quickly information was incorporated, so the understanding is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Michael — I want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from “monkey mind” impulse solutions to a methodical DRIVER approach. You consistently laid out Decision objectives, framed clear Inputs, and ran Repeatable experiments before making Verdicts. That concrete structure showed up in your project notes (well-labeled assumptions, stepwise cash-flow logic) and in your clear explanations of why a sensitivity mattered — a real sign of systematic thinking development.\n\nFor next steps, target the specific finance and integration gaps you’ve started to expose. First, tighten the financial-concepts layer: when you model investment returns, explicitly reconcile accounting vs. economic cash flows (e.g., exclude non-cash accruals when computing free cash flow, and re-check your discount-rate rationale). Second, shore up the technical/implementation edge by building simple automated checks into your model — balance-sheet sanity checks, sign/units validators, and a quick Monte Carlo or scenario table to replace single-point forecasts. Third, improve finance-technology integration: document how each data source maps to a line item and create a one-page data dictionary so assumptions aren’t lost when revisiting the model. Finally, reinforce DRIVER adherence by adding a brief “what would change the Verdict” section to each analysis — that forces you to test robustness before presenting to stakeholders.\n\nKeep going. Systematic thinking is the professional multiplier: CFOs and product leaders hire people who can consistently turn messy inputs into repeatable, defensible recommendations. You’re well on that path — treat today’s fixes as experiments, iterate, and in a year you’ll look back and see a dramatically different decision-making portfolio. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
