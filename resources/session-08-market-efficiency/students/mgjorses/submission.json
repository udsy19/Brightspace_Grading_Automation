  "transcript": "Okay, so I plug Okay, this is my maybe fourth or fifth time plugging this in Gemini. Not going to lie, I I don't know what was going on. My Gemini was just giving me a bunch of weird answers. Like a bunch of really weird responses. Like here's my one from above. This is like my fifth time. It only gave me the two stages. So I finally got a a good response and I finally found a good prompt that gave me So let me just go through this. Um so our overview is we're going to investigate the market efficiency using uh GameStop uh the short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. Um as our case study um we're going to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze the price behavior relative to the uh efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against um market efficiency or can be explained um within uh existing frameworks. And just starting here right where it says verify the statement. GameStop uh from what I found in August 2020 which I can show you here and I'll show you again later. Um August of 2020 is right here. GameStop was not traded at 4 cents. It was traded at about a dollar maybe a little bit over a dollar. Um but on average just about around a dollar 10 cents max. Um sorry. So that's where we start. Um, and yeah, so our event timeline is in August 2020, GM uh GME nearly goes uh is near bankrupt levels. Ryan Cohen, the Chewy founder, acquires 13% stake, which did happen. Um, the price was driven up to $483. Congressional hearings on the market manipulation and then as in February 2021 and the present, we have postevent uh price stabilization. There are key points. The short interest peaked at 140 uh 140% a float. retailing retail trading volume increased tfold. Uh trading restrictions implemented at the peak a hedge fund um Melvin Capital sustained 50 53% loss requiring bailout um analyst fundamental values estimate $10 to $40 per share. So I plugged all that in Gemini. They gave us our prediction goal to investigate the efficiency market hypothesis or the EMH using the 2020 2021 GameStop short squeeze as a case study. the the analysis will it says the analysis will verify factual data which is what it'll show later. Um so the first step of verification goes through it's uh this should be in the validation stage technically but it's kind of here just defining it I guess so I guess it would be both. Um the first step is to verify as it says so as I said and as I showed GameStock did not trade at 4 cents. It's incorrect. it. This says that it traded in April of 2020 at $257, but this says in April it traded at about $130, $140. So that's also incorrect, but it's close. It's still somewhat correct. Um, and so that's inaccurate. So then let's go to the represent stage. Um, this represent stage kind of gave us just what we're going to do. It imp the implement and what and the fact verification that we're going to have talking about the 483 price peak and all that. It's going to do all that later. And once they implement the EMH analysis to test GME against the three forms of market efficiency. So the weak form, the semi- strong form, which in the original output that I got was the base form. So, and then the strong form, excuse me. And then it wants us to implement um behavioral analysis and talk about the rational investors and if they could make money or not and apply our behavioral finance con uh finance concept and then validate and reflect. So that's what we're going to go through. So implement I think that this part should have been in the validation stage but I think it makes sense too. Here um they are confirming that this stake of 13% was correct. It did happen. He disclosed near 10% stake in September 2020 and then it jumped up to 13% in December. Um so that's correct. The price peak of 8 or 483 is confirmed um in January 28th of 2021. Uh the short interest is greater than 140%. So that's also correct. Um as given from this data and other public findings um the capital loss was confirmed. the hedge fund which held a large portion lost 53% and they needed a $2.75 billion bailout and uh the estimation of $10 to $40 per share during the event is also true. So yeah, that's all that I feel like that should have been in the validation stage just to kind of show that it's true, but that's okay. And then moving on, like I said, my Gemini was being really weird. And then um moving on they provided a powerful case it says on all three. So this is where the implement comes in implementing the the three uh em systems. So um the prediction is that they pass trading data and they have no predictive power. Um this was violated as it says excuse me retail investors uh led by figures like different figures led this um they use data to predict and coordinate buying effort and then the semi strong um EMH violation. Uh the prediction is that all publicly a available information is instantly reflected in the price. Um this is not true. Uh it says that the price peaked at $483, but the analysts targeted $10 to $40 per share. So obviously the um price was way higher than what they thought. And this is not true. And they violated this because they said that it was going to be um low, very low, and then they just bumped all the way up and it detached from public reality. And it was just not realistic at all. And then the strong form, the prediction was that all private and public um is in the price. Even insiders cannot profit. It says this is likely violated while because of the squeeze. Uh they say brokers like Robin Hood restricted buying. Um the distinction was private information. So they're saying that they did not the public and private information. They didn't tell everyone. Um there was advanced knowledge and they said that people could be profiting. So it's possible that people were profiting off them off this like inside of trading and stuff like that or broker risk managers as it says. So, it's not technically confirmed, but it's more than likely that people were. I mean, if you have all this information, I'm not why would you not cuz that's not ethical, but some people would say it and think like that. Um, so yeah, rational investors failed. Um, because the market was supposedly overpriced at 483 stock. Um, they it says rational arbitrators should have shorted the overpriced stock back to what it was low. they failed and the capitals the Melvin Capitals lost their money. Um the failure is uh perfectly explained by noise trade implementation costs and forced liquidation. They the forced liquidation is that they um needed a bail and they needed $2.75 billion because they didn't have their money and they need to buy um they were supposed to buy back their shares. Then this is all kind of just other things. The validation stage as we talked about before um it kind of here it kind of just talks about how the accuracy all the factual claims are verified. The initial four cents was an er error was corrected. All their key data was um corrected and all other data key data was shown. Um the logic is consistent. It kind of the failure of the rational investors um serves as evidence that limits the limits the argument. um the success of Wall Street on Reddit thesis as a direct evidence against the weak form completeness all components of the required analysis that I was given were complete even though it didn't give me an evolved stage here but I would just say that kind of it kind of implemented it in other places evolving its own argument and invol evolving kind of like what is shown and then on the reflect um the GME event means for the EMH GameStock did not prove that the efficient market hypothesis uh is an um academic model. It serves it uh it serves for real world case studies and critical or it has critical limitations. Uh it provides it proves that the market can remain in insufficient for long longer rather than rational can uh remain solvent. Um the key insight that it gave me here is uh event highlights that market efficiency is not a constant at a constant state. It's it's in a fragile equilibrium equilibrium. So it's kind of saying that like um the market's always in the shift no matter what no matter what changes. Uh so yeah some people have more capital and more risk tolerance rather than the noise traders. So like some people can take on all that money and take on all that risk while others cannot. um driver framework was essent essential to what was given and I would say what was the last question that we were meant to answer. Give me one second. Um I would say is it was possible for people to make money off this um if they would have taken other key steps that they did not take like shorting the stock or like doing other things. However though, as history proved, there was a lot of things that a lot of reasons that people lost money. So yeah, that was what my Gemini gave me. I'm not gonna lie, it was a little bit hard to understand. So, I hope I explained it enough or I hope I explained it. I explained it as best as I could. So, thank you",
