  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, enumerates concrete research questions, and details a specific, reproducible research design (Python + Yahoo Finance, verification step, event-study visualization). This clear, explicit problem definition and analytic plan meet the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly synthesizes EMH theory with behavioral finance, citing empirical findings (weak/semi-strong violations) and offering a coherent behavioral explanation (sentiment-driven herding, limits to arbitrage). This direct, evidence-linked reflection meets the strict requirement for an explicit, defendable synthesis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies weak- and semi-strong-form concepts with empirical support from their event study (Implement/Validate), showing conceptual understanding. However they do not address the strong form at all and their treatment, while correct, is not fully comprehensive or deeply nuanced, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented an event-study visualization and used it to assess market efficiency, demonstrating conceptual understanding (Represent/Implement/Validate). However, they did not calculate abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, or report estimation-window/methodological details or statistical significance, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used an event-study visualization and reasoned that prices did not rapidly or accurately reflect public fundamentals (conceptually addressing information incorporation). However, they did not perform formal timing/accuracy measurements (e.g., abnormal-return calculations, statistical tests, or explicit reaction-window analysis), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Mya — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You’ve moved past ad-hoc problem solving and now consistently breaks finance problems into clear drivers, constraints and outcomes. In your last assignment you explicitly mapped revenue levers to unit economics, documented assumptions, and walked through how each driver changes valuation — that level of decomposition shows real progress toward systematic thinking. Your written explanations made the logic trail easy to follow, which is exactly the “logic guardrail” we want to see.\n\nFor next steps, tighten a couple of technical and integration details so your models speak directly to business decisions. Concrete actions:\n- Add quick sanity checks and sensitivity runs to every model: confirm that margins, growth rates and cash flows remain within realistic bounds and flag when they don’t. This prevents misleading outputs in client or management settings.\n- Turn one driver into a decision trigger: pick a KPI (e.g., CAC payback or churn) and show the threshold where an investment swings from positive to negative NPV. That translates your model into a clear business action.\n- Document assumptions in one-line bullets at the top of deliverables and summarize the practical implication for an executive (e.g., “If churn rises 1% we need X in retention spend to preserve NPV”).\n\nKeep treating tools — AI, spreadsheets, code — as execution assistants that implement the logic you design. That habit will make your analysis reliable and persuasive in FP&A, strategy, or investor conversations. You’re on a trajectory from doing finance to thinking like a finance leader; keep leaning into DRIVER, iterate on those decision-triggered analyses, and this approach will compound into real business impact. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
