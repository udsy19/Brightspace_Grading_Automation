  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly and unambiguously defined the market-efficiency testing problem, stated the DRIVER usage, and scoped the key questions to be answered, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly and clearly described a concrete analysis plan (data source, verification objective, and event-study visualization) before implementation, satisfying the strict requirement for an articulated Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear plan and systematically executed it: acquiring data, filtering, producing event-study visuals, and using outputs to validate claims. While not exhaustive (e.g., no AR calculations), the implementation matched the stated plan and produced organized, reusable outputs, meeting the criterion for systematic execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and justifies violations of the weak and semi-strong forms using data and behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage arguments (Validate and Reflect stages), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief and does not address the strong form or deeper nuance/limitations, so it meets a correct but incomplete (PARTIAL) standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly planned and implemented an event-study style analysis (data acquisition and plotting) and used it to validate hypotheses, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform or report formal abnormal return calculations, estimation window/model choice, or statistical testing — so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used an event-study approach conceptually and interpreted plots to argue slow/inaccurate information incorporation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform formal timing or accuracy analyses (no abnormal-return calculations, event-window specification, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Mya — I want to start by celebrating how thoroughly you’ve adopted the DRIVER framework. You consistently lay out Decisions, Inputs, Risks, Variables, Execution, and Review in your work, and that discipline shows: your problem breakdowns are clear, your assumptions are explicit, and your review loops anticipate realistic business contingencies. That systematic thinking — turning a “monkey mind” reaction into a reproducible decision pattern — is exactly the intellectual habit that separates tactical analysts from strategic finance partners.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical growth areas that will deepen your impact in real business settings. First, continue strengthening financial-concepts precision where you’ve already shown progress: practice mapping model outputs back to accounting and cash-flow statements in three real scenarios (M&A, working-capital stress test, and capital budgeting). For each scenario, write one-page memos that explain how a change in a key variable alters free cash flow and enterprise value — this will tighten your conceptual linkage to business outcomes. Second, the single technical-implementation item flagged for attention suggests making your analysis more robust in execution. Make it a habit to run sensitivity checks and document the rationale for chosen ranges (best/worst/most likely) before sharing results. In meetings, present one “what would make you change your view” slide tied to those sensitivities.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as a career skill, not just a classroom tool. As you apply DRIVER to messy, real-world finance problems, you’ll convert analyses into trusted business recommendations. I’m excited to see where this disciplined approach takes you — you’re building a professional superpower that will compound over every project you touch."
