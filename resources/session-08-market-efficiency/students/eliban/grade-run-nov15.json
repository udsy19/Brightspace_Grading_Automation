  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research question, corrected factual data, and identified required datasets and the formal event-study approach, including a visualized plan and concrete steps (estimation/event windows and target metrics). Those explicit statements satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly presented a structured framework (visual plan), specified the event-study approach, defined estimation/event windows, and identified the market-model (alpha/beta) and AR/CAR metrics—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. Minor wording inconsistencies do not undermine the clear, defendable analytical framework provided.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documented a clear, structured event-study workflow (window selection, market-model estimation, AR/CAR calculation), executed it with code/data tools, and reported concrete outputs and significance tests—demonstrating systematic implementation. While some detail (e.g., full statistical reporting or robustness checks) is limited, the implemented workflow follows the planned methodology and yields interpretable results consistent with the DRIVER implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and empirically tests weak and semi-strong EMH, giving concrete methodological steps and specific justifications (volume/momentum and delayed public-information reaction). However, treatment is incomplete for full mastery: the strong form is not addressed and the discussion, while correct, lacks deeper theoretical nuance and comprehensive coverage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements the core event-study steps (estimation window, market model, OLS, AR/CAR computation) and reports parameter estimates and significant results, demonstrating conceptual competence. However, treatment lacks thoroughness and rigor expected for a PASS (e.g., inconsistent window descriptions, no detail on test statistics/standard errors, robustness checks, or precise AR/CAR formulas), so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information incorporation and applies an event-study to test market response to public information, citing delayed reactions and statistically significant CARs. However, the treatment lacks depth on timing (no intraday analysis, explicit event-day AR timing, or robustness checks), so the understanding is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Elisah — I’ve noticed how reliably you translate complex ideas into clear, teachable explanations. Your written walkthroughs break problems into logical steps, you annotate reasoning so a reader can follow the “why” as well as the “how,” and you consistently surface the key assumptions behind a conclusion. Those are exactly the communication habits that mark a DRIVER transformation: your thinking is becoming structured rather than reactive.\n\nNext steps to deepen that transformation: turn your clear explanations into tighter financial-proof routines. For financial concepts, practice building and reconciling simple three-statement models from real company snippets (income, balance sheet, cash flow) so you can trace how an accounting change flows into valuation. In applied valuation work, regularly run sensitivity scenarios (best/worst cases), and document which inputs drive value most — this strengthens concept accuracy and makes your recommendations actionable for business leaders. For technical implementation and integration, embed small “logic guardrails” into your models: sanity-check rows (e.g., cash never negative unless modeled), unit-checks, and a one-page assumptions dashboard. Use these to speed review and to communicate model health to nontechnical stakeholders.\n\nKeep treating AI as an execution assistant — prompt it to generate test cases or alternative scenarios, then use DRIVER to verify results. This journey of disciplined, repeatable thinking is exactly what will set you apart in finance: not just knowing the right formula, but reliably proving why a decision holds up under scrutiny. I’m excited to see where you take this next—keep iterating, testing, and explaining."
