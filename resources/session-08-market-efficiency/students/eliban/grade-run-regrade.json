  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly computed abnormal returns (AR/CAR), provided model parameters and estimation choices, and interpreted the abnormal returns with plausible market-mechanism explanations tying finance and technology (data/code). Coverage is specific, methodologically grounded, and connects calculations to economic reasoning, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the testing problem with clear research questions, corrected key factual errors, and identified the precise data needed for an event-study — satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a concrete analysis plan (methodology, windows, model, equations, and specific steps) and tied it to the research question, meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is specific and actionable, so it satisfies the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and explains violations of the weak and semi-strong forms with empirical support (event study, large CAR, volume/momentum example) and discusses limits to arbitrage as mechanism. However, treatment is incomplete for the criterion because the strong-form (insider-information) implications are not explicitly analyzed and overall discussion, while correct, lacks the comprehensive depth and multiple detailed treatments required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly selected and applied an event-study framework, estimated a market model (alpha/beta) via OLS, calculated ARs/CARs, and reported significance — demonstrating conceptual competence. However, methodological details and consistency (e.g., precise estimation vs. event-window definitions, formulas/tests used, treatment of splits/standard errors) are incomplete or ambiguous, so the work is solid but not the thorough, detailed treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used an event-study framework and tied specific news/events to tests of how information was incorporated, concluding a delayed, non-fundamental market response. However, the treatment lacks detailed timing analyses (e.g., immediate vs. multi-day reaction tests, intraday resolution, controls) and rigorous demonstration of causality, so the work shows correct conceptual approach but is not thorough enough for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Elisah — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve begun to think like a DRIVER student. Your work showed a concrete integration of finance and technology: you didn’t just bolt code onto a problem, you used computational tools to surface drivers (revenue streams, margin levers, working-capital timing) and tied them back to business intuition. That ability to translate messy business questions into structured, testable components is the heart of systematic thinking—and you’re doing it.\n\nNow, next steps to sharpen impact. A few financial-concept areas still need tightening even as I see progress: make your economic assumptions explicit and reconciled across statements (e.g., ensure growth rates, margins, and capex feed consistently from the revenue model into cash flows). Practice three concrete habits:\n- Build a linked three-statement model for a simple real company and walk through how a one-point change in a driver flows to FCFE and valuation.\n- Add sensitivity tables and scenario narratives (best/base/worst) so trade-offs are visible for a CFO or founder.\n- Use a validation checklist: reconcile EBITDA to cash, check working-capital days against industry benchmarks, and cite the source or rationale for each assumption.\n\nOn technical implementation, treat code as a guardrail: write short tests that confirm your model links, and produce a one-page executive summary that explains the model’s key drivers in plain English. These steps turn technical outputs into business-ready decisions.\n\nKeep going—this is a journey. The disciplined approach you’re building will be the difference between an analyst who produces numbers and a finance partner who generates decisions. I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next."
