  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the problem, frames precise research questions, and specifies the data and primary tests needed to assess market efficiency, satisfying the Define & Discover stage. While not every parameter (e.g., exact event window lengths) is specified, the research design is explicit and actionable, meeting the strict requirement for this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external validation by fetching and comparing price data from third‑party websites (named source) and used that comparison to correct a specific claim (4 cents → ~$4–$6), fulfilling the Validate requirement. Although more sources or formal statistical robustness checks would strengthen validation, the submission explicitly demonstrates external verification and therefore passes.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly contrasts EMH (identifying weak/semi‑strong/strong form considerations) with behavioral explanations (herding, social‑media driven demand, limits to arbitrage) and draws reasoned conclusions about why behavioral finance better explains the event’s mechanics and persistence. This clear, explicit synthesis meets the strict requirement for the Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies weak, semi-strong, and strong form criteria and gives plausible, conceptually accurate reasons for potential violations, supported by planned tests (Discover/Implement) and conclusions (Reflect). However the treatment is brief and lacks rigorous evidence, formal testing results, or detailed examples, so it demonstrates correct understanding but not the thorough, in-depth coverage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly outlines key components of an event study (market benchmark for expected returns, return calculation, data sourcing) and shows intent to implement them (Discover/Implement). However, they do not present a detailed methodology (estimation/event windows, market model specification, CAR computation) nor report statistical tests or results, so understanding is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the research goal and plans appropriate tests (returns, time-series predictability) showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they did not perform or report concrete timing results, event-window/intraday analysis, or statistical evidence quantifying speed/accuracy of information reflection, so the treatment is incomplete and warrants PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Brody — I want to applaud how you’ve moved from ad-hoc thinking to a DRIVER-style, system-first approach. You consistently broke cash flows down by operational drivers (units → price → margin) and tied those drivers through to the three financial statements. Your scenario tables were clear, your assumptions were consistently labeled, and your explanations showed you’re thinking like a CFO who needs defensible numbers — not just a calculator. Those are exactly the habits that convert “monkey minds” into reliable financial thinking.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: one financial concept needs polishing — the timing and measurement of working capital. In practice, that means (a) map when cash actually arrives/leaves (sales vs. collections, inventory purchase vs. usage), (b) convert DSO/DPO/DIO into cash-days and test them across scenarios, and (c) reconcile the working-capital line with operating cash flow in a weekly/monthly business model. On the technical-implementation side, add lightweight validation checks: a balance-sheet tie-out, cash-flow reconciliation test, and a flagged tolerance when margins or ROIC move more than expected. These are small “logic guardrails” that protect business decisions — for example, they stop overinvestment in inventory or underestimating financing need in a growth plan.\n\nKeep treating code and AI as execution assistants: use them to run sensitivity batches and produce the charts you’ll present to stakeholders, but lead the interpretation. This is a multi-year craft — your systematic habits are the core asset. Keep iterating on real business cases (budget cycles, fundraising memos, acquisition screens) and you’ll find that employers value the disciplined thinker far more than perfect syntax. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
