  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (goals, scope, and concrete research questions) and identified initial data/verification needs, satisfying the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage. The articulation is specific enough for a reviewer to understand the planned testable questions.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a concrete plan/layout for analyzing market efficiency: specified required datasets, benchmark returns, specific statistical tests (autocorrelation/predictability, abnormal-return calculation), and data validation steps. These clearly satisfy the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage, so the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed external validation: they identified the claim to check, fetched data from external finance websites, and reported a corrected price range ( ~$4–$6) versus the claimed $0.04. Although details about exact sources/methods are brief, the submission shows concrete external comparison and correction, meeting the Validate criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them conceptually to the GME event (Reflect), and planned analyses to test them (Implement). However, treatment is high-level and lacks rigorous empirical testing or statistical results to substantiate the claims, so the understanding is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of event-study components (market benchmark, abnormal returns, use of log returns) and plans implementation, but provides no reported abnormal-return calculations, statistical tests, or rigorous results. Because methodology is correctly described but not executed or substantiated, the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the components and methods needed to assess information incorporation (benchmarks, abnormal returns, sentiment, and testing) and planned implementation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform or report empirical timing or statistical tests (noted limitations and reliance on daily data), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Brody — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a DRIVER-style workflow. You consistently decompose finance problems into Data, Rules, Inputs, Validation, Execution, and Reporting — and you apply that structure when framing valuation and cash-flow questions. Your habit of stating assumptions up front and building a reproducible chain of logic shows real progress toward systematic thinking: stakeholders can follow your decision path instead of guessing at it. That clarity is exactly what separates tactical analysts from strategic finance partners.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two practical areas that will pay immediate business dividends. First, strengthen the technical implementation guardrails around Execution: add lightweight validation layers (sanity checks, boundary tests, and a simple sensitivity matrix) so model outputs are resilient to input variation. In a deal or budgeting cycle this prevents costly surprises and speeds stakeholder buy-in. Second, deepen the integration between your models and business context by mapping outputs to specific managerial actions — e.g., link a cash-runway scenario to concrete cost-cutting levers or funding triggers. That connection turns your analysis into executable recommendations finance leaders can act on.\n\nKeep treating the DRIVER framework as a habit, not a checklist. Over time that discipline will make you the person teams trust to translate messy business questions into reliable financial decisions. This is a long, compounding journey — and you’re already on the path. I’m excited to see how you tighten those guardrails and turn analyses into direct business impact."
