Um so starting off this is 00:00:10.880 um we're going to be investigating the 00:00:12.480 market um efficiency using GameStop 00:00:15.759 short squeeze event of 20 2020 to 2021 00:00:20.080 as a case study and verifying the 00:00:22.400 accuracy of stated facts. analyzing the 00:00:24.720 price behavior relative to the efficient 00:00:26.480 market hypothesis predictions and 00:00:28.800 evaluate whether market anomalies 00:00:31.359 constitute evidence against market 00:00:33.440 efficiency or they can be explained 00:00:35.440 without existing frameworks. Um so 00:00:39.520 that's just defining the problem. So um 00:00:42.559 we're going to use the GameStop case 00:00:44.320 study. Um, we will need historical price 00:00:47.440 data from August 2022, September 22, and 00:00:52.879 um, sorry, August 2020, September 2020, 00:00:56.399 January 2021. And then we're going to 00:00:58.719 verify specific claims um, for example, 00:01:02.000 the um, critical first step that 00:01:04.559 GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 00:01:06.880 2020. Um, and then we're also going to 00:01:09.119 analyze specific theories like E MH 00:01:12.159 versus behavioral. And then the three 00:01:15.439 forms of market efficiency is weak form. 00:01:19.040 Um prices reflect all past price and 00:01:22.479 volume information. So technical 00:01:24.640 analysis won't work here. And then semi- 00:01:26.799 strong form. So these prices reflect all 00:01:29.680 public um publicly available 00:01:31.600 information. Fundamental analysis also 00:01:33.840 doesn't work. And then strong form which 00:01:38.000 is prices reflect all information. So 00:01:41.040 including private information. So, 00:01:43.200 insider trading doesn't work. And then 00:01:46.799 the plan um for this project is this 00:01:50.960 assignment. And then I'm also going to 00:01:52.479 provide like the code that we'll be 00:01:53.920 seeing later for like the implement 00:01:55.520 stage right under it. But um our plan is 00:01:58.399 we need to get GameStop's entire price 00:02:00.880 history. So that will be seen as the get 00:02:04.719 GME data function. Also, GME is like the 00:02:08.399 stock um name on like Yahoo Finance or 00:02:11.760 anything like that um for GameStop. And 00:02:14.400 then our next um step is to tackle the 00:02:16.319 critical first step of checking if um 00:02:19.120 GameStop was traded at 4 cents in August 00:02:21.360 2020. And we're doing that by the 00:02:24.480 implement stage in verify price claim 00:02:26.720 function. And then I need the other key 00:02:29.040 data points from the timeline. So the 00:02:31.520 $483 as peak and the September 2020 00:02:37.280 price to do my analysis 00:02:40.560 and then this will be represented as 00:02:42.959 find key event prices function. Then 00:02:45.440 lastly part of my plan I need to connect 00:02:47.200 this data back to the assignments 00:02:48.560 questions in regards to EMH 00:02:52.080 and um 00:02:54.560 um behavioral and this will be shown 00:02:57.440 represented as the show evolve reflect 00:03:00.239 prompt function. Okay. So getting into 00:03:03.280 the code. Oh starting off sorry I put 00:03:05.760 this all in Gemini like the assignment 00:03:09.440 and then I put a prompt create a Python 00:03:11.599 code that answers the assignment. use 00:03:12.879 the KISS principle and driver method to 00:03:14.800 make it super easy to understand and 00:03:16.400 teach someone with little financial 00:03:17.840 knowledge. Um and then I just put it in 00:03:22.080 and it gave me the output and then here 00:03:25.200 that is. 00:03:27.599 So, um, as you can see, I just got a 00:03:31.440 Python script, and this specifically, 00:03:35.599 um, uses, um, Yahoo Finance, um, library 00:03:40.000 to gather all the information needed. 00:03:43.200 And it also uses the KISS principle 00:03:45.120 throughout to keep it um, simple and 00:03:48.080 stupid for anyone who is seeing this. 00:03:51.040 And it also goes through like a little 00:03:52.400 bit of driver as well. 00:03:54.640 Um 00:03:56.239 so as you could see I already went 00:03:57.680 through the define stage and the 00:03:59.120 represent stage and then this script is 00:04:01.439 what we're on right now and then later 00:04:03.280 on it'll um validate it throughout our 00:04:06.480 findings and also we'll get into like 00:04:08.400 reflection and evolving as well. Okay so 00:04:12.879 um starting here like I said it fetches 00:04:15.360 data from Yahoo Finance. So this is like 00:04:17.440 this section over here um about GameStop 00:04:21.440 specifically. So it will be gathering um 00:04:25.440 specifically its stock market name and 00:04:28.720 its entire history of um 00:04:34.160 oh sorry yeah uh so this is so it's this 00:04:37.600 is the Yahoo Finance like library we 00:04:39.520 like set it up within the script and 00:04:41.280 then going on to the implement stage of 00:04:43.280 the code. So the first section is we're 00:04:46.400 getting all the GameStop stock data um 00:04:49.680 through Yahoo Finance. So the first one 00:04:51.840 is just getting its stock market name. 00:04:54.240 So that's GME. The next we're getting 00:04:56.320 its entire history of its price. Um 00:04:59.759 literally the entire the entire history 00:05:01.680 of it. Um third is we're just checking 00:05:04.960 to see if all data was actually 00:05:06.720 retrieved at the end making sure there 00:05:08.800 was no errors and if there was it would 00:05:10.720 print an error message and then also a 00:05:13.520 success message if it was good. And then 00:05:18.320 um we return the data so that other 00:05:20.160 functions can use it as well. And then 00:05:24.880 then oh yeah then we're going to go on 00:05:27.520 to the next section. This is going to 00:05:30.320 print um this is the critical first step 00:05:34.800 from the assignment. So seeing if it's 00:05:36.479 actually the 4 cents in 2020. So, like I 00:05:40.400 said, um text the price in 2020 and it's 00:05:43.520 going to validate if GameStop traded at 00:05:45.600 4 cents in August. So, starting off, we 00:05:48.800 will be um defining the range we care 00:05:52.320 about. So, August 1st to August 31st in 00:05:56.320 2020. 00:05:57.840 And then it's going to be grabbing all 00:06:00.400 the data within the rows in that date 00:06:03.440 range. And then it's going to be finding 00:06:06.639 also the lowest and highest price within 00:06:09.919 that month. And it's going to print our 00:06:12.240 findings as well. And then um it's just 00:06:16.400 going to format it nicely as well. And 00:06:19.440 then we're checking the 4% claim 00:06:24.319 um whether it's like likely on the 00:06:26.960 pre-split or the post-split and all that 00:06:29.759 stuff. 00:06:31.520 And then 00:06:34.160 moving on to the next function that's 00:06:39.039 going to find is going to find key 00:06:40.800 prices from the timeline to help with 00:06:42.800 the rest of the analysis. So we're going 00:06:45.840 to be finding the um the peak price in 00:06:49.039 January 2021. So the range would be from 00:06:52.720 January 1st to January 31st in 2021. And 00:06:56.240 then it's also going to find the price 00:06:59.440 uh around September 2020 for Ryan Cohen. 00:07:04.319 Like I said, September 1st to September 00:07:06.479 30th in 2020. And then it's going to 00:07:10.000 print that. And then lastly, it's going 00:07:12.319 to um this whole kiss section. This is 00:07:16.479 just printing like the questions that 00:07:18.639 we're going to be answering um at the 00:07:20.720 end in like the evolve and like reflect 00:07:23.599 section with like some of the answers as 00:07:26.160 well. And then down here is just a to-do 00:07:29.360 list of what we're just going to cover. 00:07:31.680 So the define and represent and then the 00:07:35.120 implement with like grabbing the 00:07:36.800 implement and validating again like I 00:07:38.720 said just grabbing GameStop's data 00:07:40.800 validating and making sure it's actually 00:07:42.639 4% traded in August. Um, and then the 00:07:46.880 key key events on the timeline and then 00:07:49.599 finally our and discussion. 00:07:52.960 Okay, I'm gonna run this. 00:07:55.440 Awesome. It worked. Um, 00:07:59.039 so going off of this. 00:08:02.879 Let me scroll on this side. So, I ran 00:08:04.720 the script. Um, so the one thing we 00:08:09.039 really wanted to do was validate whether 00:08:12.720 GameStop traded at 4% in I mean 4 cents 00:08:15.919 in August 2020. So this scripts output 00:08:20.400 clearly shows the claim that GameStop 00:08:23.680 traded at four at 4 cents in August 2020 00:08:28.080 is incorrect. 00:08:30.080 Um, 00:08:32.080 and um, 00:08:35.120 oh yeah, it says it right here for you 00:08:36.958 to see. 00:08:38.719 And then it also shows like the highest 00:08:40.958 and lowest range, which is what I was 00:08:42.479 talking about before. Um, 00:08:45.920 and yeah, so the actual like lowest 00:08:48.800 price in August 2020 was, let me scroll 00:08:53.120 a little bit. Um, the actual price in 00:08:55.200 August 2020 was $41. 00:08:59.839 So this price is the post stock split. 00:09:03.360 So the original claim could have been um 00:09:06.080 based on a different data source or it 00:09:08.720 was a typo. And it found that the lowest 00:09:11.279 price was $1 and the highest was $1.79 00:09:18.240 um during August 2020. 00:09:21.519 So um then moving on to this part, this 00:09:26.880 just identifies um the peak price in 00:09:29.279 January 2021 as 00:09:32.800 127 I mean $120.75 00:09:36.959 on January 28th, 2021. It also notes the 00:09:41.839 difference with the assignments $483. 00:09:46.320 um the claim explaining that this would 00:09:48.000 be due to the pre-market or intraday 00:09:51.279 highs not captured by the high column um 00:09:55.600 in the daily data. It also provides 00:09:59.519 um the average closing price in 00:10:01.440 September 2020 as $2.13 00:10:06.240 which is relevant to um understanding 00:10:09.040 the stock price before the major short 00:10:11.760 squeeze event. 00:10:14.240 And then 00:10:16.160 um also 00:10:21.040 um 00:10:23.440 yeah, so the script's data just like 00:10:25.200 perfectly validates that the $483 00:10:28.480 claim is demonstrating a correct 00:10:30.399 understanding of the split adjusted 00:10:33.519 data. 00:10:35.040 And then moving on to the fun stuff. So 00:10:41.360 talking about um oh these were all the 00:10:44.160 like the questions that I was talking 00:10:45.600 about like in the prompts from the 00:10:47.519 before. So the market efficiency was 00:10:50.720 this violated. Um so this is the 00:10:54.959 validated data um strongly challenges 00:10:58.079 the semi- strong and strong form while 00:11:00.959 the weak form was most likely held. So 00:11:03.920 the weak form um which was held this 00:11:07.920 form says that you can't predict future 00:11:09.760 prices by looking at past prices. So 00:11:12.320 technical analysis doesn't work. The um 00:11:15.680 GameStop spike was sudden and external 00:11:19.680 event driven by social media not a 00:11:22.880 predictable pattern from its um past 00:11:25.279 price chart. And then um no standard 00:11:29.680 technical model would have predicted it. 00:11:32.000 So the weak form holds in the past 00:11:34.640 prices are useless. 00:11:37.920 And then for semi strong this was 00:11:40.880 obviously violated. Um this form just 00:11:44.079 says all public information instantly 00:11:46.560 reflected in the price and this is the 00:11:50.640 most obvious violation. And then um 00:11:52.959 there was like public news like Ryan 00:11:55.200 Cohen um disclosed his 13% stake in 00:11:58.320 September 2020. 00:12:00.399 And then also data from like my script 00:12:03.120 is it shows the price in September 2020 00:12:05.839 was only around $160 to $2.70 which is 00:12:10.000 split adjusted. Um and then the market 00:12:13.279 did not instantly price 00:12:16.399 in this major public news and it took 4 00:12:18.720 months into social media frenzy for the 00:12:21.360 price to react. So this 4 month lag is a 00:12:25.760 massive violation. 00:12:28.959 This is obviously said it in like a 00:12:31.440 shorter version than I just did, but um 00:12:34.399 for the strong form um this form just 00:12:37.440 says all information public and private 00:12:39.440 is in the price and no one can beat the 00:12:41.200 market. This is almost always considered 00:12:43.920 false, but GameStop is obviously a great 00:12:46.639 example. And the private information was 00:12:50.320 the collective plan in sentiment 00:12:52.720 building within the um community for um 00:12:58.320 for a time. Also, the group did 00:13:01.839 um did beat the market, proving that 00:13:03.839 this private knowledge had value at some 00:13:07.519 point. And then moving on to 00:13:12.480 whether 00:13:14.079 um could rational investors have 00:13:15.600 profited systematically. 00:13:17.680 So um systematically means um 00:13:20.560 reliability over and over. Could you 00:13:22.639 have known to buy in September 2020 and 00:13:25.279 sell at 483? And could you have known 00:13:28.160 when to get out? Um is this a one time 00:13:31.279 thing, not a system? Um so could a 00:13:35.120 rational investor profit systematically? 00:13:36.880 No. a rational investor could not profit 00:13:40.079 systematically. Um, systematically just 00:13:42.639 implies repeatable, reliable, 00:13:45.360 riskadjusted strategy. And the GameStop 00:13:47.920 event was very chaotic in a one time per 00:13:51.440 stock event driven by the social media 00:13:53.920 frenzy, not really a system. And then 00:13:57.040 looking back, it's easy to say like buy 00:13:59.279 in September and sell in January. Um, 00:14:04.959 so you really couldn't have known. Um, 00:14:08.000 rationality versus speculation. So 00:14:10.399 looking forward like a rational investor 00:14:12.720 must weigh risk and buying GameStop in 00:14:15.440 December 2020 was pure speculation, not 00:14:18.959 a strategy. And then you had no way to 00:14:21.680 know if January 28th was the peak or 00:14:24.320 just the beginning. 00:14:26.000 um the risk of a total collapse was 00:14:28.320 enormous and um enormous at every second 00:14:32.639 and there was also no exit signal. There 00:14:35.040 was no rational quot system to tell you 00:14:37.839 when to sell. So the people who profited 00:14:40.079 did so through luck, timing and just 00:14:42.560 speculation, not a repeatable system. 00:14:46.079 And then moving on to the last section, 00:14:48.560 what behavioral finance explanations 00:14:50.639 fit? So hurting 00:14:53.440 um everyone on Wall Street bets buy 00:14:56.720 spying at once overconfidence believing 00:14:58.560 that the stock could only go up to the 00:15:00.240 moon limits to um arbitrage which didn't 00:15:04.800 rational investors short it at $483. 00:15:09.920 Um so going on to that hurting this is 00:15:13.040 the most obvious. Millions of individual 00:15:15.360 investors coordinate on the Wall Street 00:15:17.920 forum. Um all did the same action which 00:15:20.480 was buy GameStop at the same time. Um 00:15:23.760 which is this the definition of hurting 00:15:26.000 behavior buying at once. 00:15:28.720 Um overconfidence. So the narratives on 00:15:33.360 the forum like diamond hands which means 00:15:36.079 like they never sell and like to the 00:15:37.760 moon which means the price will go to 00:15:39.760 infinity are classic examples. Um 00:15:42.720 investors become overconfident in their 00:15:46.240 us versus them narrative ignoring the 00:15:49.360 company's actual um fundamentals which 00:15:52.480 were poor at the time and the immense 00:15:55.680 risk of a crash. So the li the limits to 00:15:58.959 arbitrage this is the most important 00:16:01.680 financial con concept. It just means um 00:16:05.600 when rational investors correct a wrong 00:16:08.800 price. So by short selling an 00:16:11.199 overstocked um an overpriced stock. So 00:16:14.560 the price of GameStop was wrong and it 00:16:16.959 was not worth $483. 00:16:19.360 So why didn't rational why didn't 00:16:22.959 rational investors fix it? it's because 00:16:25.920 it was too risky and then um the 00:16:29.120 arbitrageers, the hedge funds like 00:16:31.040 Milton Capital, they were trying to 00:16:33.360 short it and um they just became 00:16:36.240 bankrupt by the hurting of the retail 00:16:39.360 and so the risk of unlimited losses from 00:16:41.839 shorting and the cost of borrowing the 00:16:43.519 stock were so high that the rational 00:16:45.360 trade became impossible. And this is a 00:16:48.399 limit to arbitrage which allowed the 00:16:50.800 wrong price to exist for a short time. 00:16:54.720 And then um 00:16:58.480 ending things off like reflecting on 00:17:00.800 this assignment. So the GameStop event 00:17:04.160 shows that the market is not a simple 00:17:06.559 efficient machine. It's a complex system 00:17:09.599 driven by both rational analysis and 00:17:12.079 powerful behavioral forces. And then the 00:17:16.160 EMH is a useful baseline, but it's 00:17:18.480 incomplete. So behavioral finance is 00:17:21.039 essential for explaining um anomalies 00:17:23.679 like this which are becoming more common 00:17:26.240 in the age of social media. And then 00:17:28.880 this lastly this event shows that while 00:17:31.280 passive investing like index funds is 00:17:34.720 smart for most there is a clear rule for 00:17:37.440 active management that understands 00:17:39.039 market structure sentiment and it also 00:17:41.840 limits to arbitrage. But that is it and 00:17:46.480 thank you guys for listening.",
