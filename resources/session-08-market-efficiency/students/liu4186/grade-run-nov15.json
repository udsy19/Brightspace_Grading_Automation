  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission provides a thorough, methodical treatment of all three EMH forms: clear test designs, executed empirical results (e.g., autocorrelation and a >200% CAR), and interpretive discussion including insider/behavioral evidence. These elements demonstrate deep conceptual understanding and multiple supporting applications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study methodology (market model, explicit estimation/event windows, AR and CAR computation), executes it with empirical results (>200% CAR, autocorrelation) and discusses interpretation and robustness. This combination of conceptual design, implementation, and reflection meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly designed and implemented an event-study to measure how public information was reflected in prices (estimation/event windows, CAPM, AR/CAR) and reported quantitative results (>200% CAR, autocorrelation). Their analysis and interpretation directly address speed and accuracy of information incorporation, with sufficient methodological detail and empirical evidence to meet the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses several key biases (herding, overconfidence, anchoring, confirmation, hindsight) and links them to the GME episode, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, coverage is incomplete—loss aversion and mental accounting are not explicitly addressed and behavioral claims are mainly qualitative without deeper measurement—so the treatment is correct but not fully comprehensive, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, executed treatment of momentum (design, implementation, empirical and visual evidence) but does not analyze other anomaly classes (value, size, calendar effects) in depth or perform formal tests for them. Coverage is correct for momentum but incomplete across the full set of required market anomalies, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes the CAPM-based abnormal-return framework, reports running Python code, data checks, and quantitative outputs, so there is evidence of execution and basic verification. However, the submission lacks explicit code snippets, block-by-block explanation of functions or calculations, and explicit ownership/detail of implementation steps required by the STRICT technical standard, so it cannot receive a full PASS.",

In your recent work you consistently framed problems with precise decision drivers, laid out assumptions explicitly, and communicated your logic so a non-technical stakeholder could follow the financial implications. That clarity — especially your habit of stating the question, the key levers, and the expected business outcome — is exactly the shift from “monkey mind” reactions to systematic analysis that we aim for.\n\nLooking ahead, the most useful next steps are practical and concrete. Your technical implementation showed promising progress in translating logic into executable steps; now focus on making those steps more robust for real-world finance use. Actionable next moves:\n- Build a short sensitivity checklist: for each major assumption (growth, margin, working capital), produce one upside, one downside, and the effect on cash flow and P&L.\n- Add a stress-test scenario that ties to a business decision (e.g., funding need, pricing change) and document which assumptions drive the decision.\n- Create a one-page “logic guardrail” that maps assumptions → formulas → business interpretation so others can audit your model quickly.\n- Use peer walkthroughs or brief stakeholder summaries as a habit to surface missing logic or hidden trade-offs before finalizing recommendations.\n\nKeep treating AI as an execution assistant and your job as the designer of the logic — that mindset will accelerate you faster than focusing on any one tool. Your systematic habits are already career-defining: finance leaders prize people who can translate messy reality into clear, actionable choices. This is a journey — keep iterating on these guardrails and stress-tests, and you’ll continue to grow into the kind of thinker organizations rely on in tough decisions. I’m excited to see your next iteration."
