At the Define and Discover step, the 2020–2021 GameStop short squeeze represents one of the most striking real-world challenges to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which claims that asset prices fully reflect all available information. The primary objective of this study was to analyze whether the GME phenomenon violated any of the three forms of market efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong, and to explore whether behavioral finance offered a better explanation of investor behavior during this extraordinary event. In early 2021, GameStop's stock price surged from under five dollars to nearly $483, driven not by fundamental valuation but by a wave of coordinated retail investor activity, most notably through Reddit's or Wall Street community. This collective action, targeting hedge funds that had heavily shorted the stock, created an unprecedented and self-reinforcing price escalation that defied conventional financial logic. The first step in the analysis was to verify a factual claim provided in the assignment: that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020. Historical data from Yahoo Finance was retrieved, and the findings immediately contradicted this statement. The adjusted prices for August 2020 showed that the stock opened at $1.00, reached a monthly low of $0.84, and closed at $1.65. Since all Yahoo Finance data are automatically adjusted for corporate actions, including GameStop's 4-for-1 stock split in 2022, the verified low of $0.84 confirmed that the $0.04 figure was false by a factor of twenty-one. This verification ensured that all subsequent analysis proceeded from accurate data rather than from a misleading premise. At the Represent stage, the analytical design followed a four-phase framework corresponding to the three forms of the EMH and the integration of behavioral finance. In the weak-form test, GME and S&P 500 data were downloaded, and daily logarithmic returns were computed to test whether past prices contained predictive power for future returns. If price movements are predictable, it implies that past information has not been fully incorporated into current prices, violating the weak form of efficiency. In the semi-strong form test, a market model was built using the CAPM to establish GameStop's normal relationship with the broader market. The estimation window spanned August through October 2020, representing a pre-event baseline period, while the event window captured the peak squeeze period from January to February 2021. Abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns were then calculated to determine whether public information, such as short interest and social media discussions, was already reflected in market prices. Finally, the strong-form test and behavioral analysis examined whether insider information and psychological biases played a role, using qualitative evidence from public disclosures, Reddit discussions, and trading patterns. At the Implement step, when the analysis was executed, the data passed all integrity checks, and the Python-based system successfully retrieved and visualized the relevant historical data. The factual verification confirmed that the $0.04 price claim was false, with the actual split-adjusted low being one dollar. The weak-form test produced an autocorrelation value of approximately –0.0035, suggesting minimal serial correlation in GME's daily returns. Although this might superficially appear consistent with weak-form efficiency, the visual inspection of price and volume charts told a very different story. From late 2020 through early 2021, the price followed a classic \"rocket ship\" pattern; past price increases seemed to generate further buying pressure, creating clear evidence of momentum. In other words, while the numerical test suggested weak correlation, investor behavior and visual trends revealed that recent gains strongly influenced expectations of future gains, indicating a practical violation of the weak form of market efficiency. The semi-strong form test, represented by the cumulative abnormal returns, provided even clearer evidence of inefficiency. If markets were semi-strong efficient, cumulative abnormal returns would hover randomly around zero, as new public information would already be incorporated into prices. Instead, the CAR line displayed a massive, explosive upward movement, peaking at more than 200% during the height of the squeeze. This result showed that the market failed to efficiently process widely available public information, such as Reddit discussions, short-interest data, and trading restrictions by brokers like Robinhood. The CAR pattern thus confirmed a strong violation of semi-strong form efficiency. Even though some minor variations in alpha and beta could occur if the estimation window changed, no reasonable market model could ever have predicted the extraordinary returns observed during this event. Let's move into the Validate. In the strong-form and behavioral analysis, the investigation found that certain actors may have benefited from private information. Ryan Cohen's acquisition of a 13% stake in GameStop, later revealed to have been purchased before public disclosure, demonstrated that insider knowledge played a material role in anticipating the firm's strategic transformation. This directly contradicts the strong form of EMH, which asserts that even private information is fully reflected in prices. Beyond insider activity, behavioral finance offered a more compelling lens through which to interpret the overall market behavior. Reddit posts and memes such as \"Apes together strong\" and \"Diamond hands\" exemplified herding, overconfidence, and confirmation bias. Retail investors anchored their beliefs to arbitrary price targets, often $1,000 per share, with no connection to GameStop's fundamental value, which most analysts placed between $10 and $40. The limits to arbitrage also played a crucial role. Rational investors and institutional short-sellers were unable to correct the mispricing because of extreme constraints: short interest reached 140% of the float, borrowing costs were astronomical, and margin calls forced liquidations that further fueled the rally. The mechanics of the \"gamma squeeze\" in the options market amplified volatility even further. These structural limitations, combined with behavioral contagion through social media, created a perfect storm that disconnected price from any semblance of fundamental valuation. The next step is the Evolve. The results of the analysis demonstrate that markets can experience severe, though temporary, breakdowns in efficiency. The GameStop episode was not just a random anomaly; it was a vivid manifestation of how information asymmetry, structural constraints, and collective psychology can interact to destabilize price discovery. For most investors, the event reinforces the importance of passive, diversified investing strategies. Attempts to \"catch\" the next GameStop are essentially speculative gambles, as even being fundamentally correct, as in the case of hedge funds betting against GME, offers no protection if timing and market sentiment turn against you. From a behavioral perspective, the GameStop event revealed the unprecedented power of social media to coordinate and amplify retail investor sentiment. Platforms like Reddit became arenas of collective action, where emotional narratives overpowered rational analysis. This created a feedback loop in which rising prices validated the community's confidence, encouraging further buying and pushing prices even higher. The event also prompted major policy discussions about transparency in short-interest reporting, the ethics of \"payment for order flow\" practices, and the dangers of gamified trading platforms that blur the line between investing and entertainment. Here is the Reflect. The study concludes that while the Efficient Market Hypothesis remains a useful model for understanding long-term price behavior in most markets, the GameStop saga proves that markets are not perfect machines but human systems subject to emotion, coordination, and structural fragility. Both the weak and semi-strong forms of EMH were clearly violated, and the behavioral finance framework provides a far better explanation of what occurred. Before the event, no rational investor could have systematically profited; those who did either acted on insider knowledge or participated in irrational speculation. Looking back after the fact, many claim they \"should have bought,\" but this hindsight bias merely illustrates how unpredictable and psychologically driven the market became. The GameStop short squeeze stands as a powerful reminder that efficiency is not an absolute condition but a fragile equilibrium. When social media coordination, extreme short exposure, and widespread behavioral biases converge, markets can detach entirely from fundamental value. The case serves as both a cautionary tale and an enduring lesson in modern finance: markets may correct themselves over time, but in the short run, they are vulnerable to human emotion, narrative contagion, and the limits of rational arbitrage.",
