  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly applies their efficiency findings to concrete investment strategy recommendations—arguing passive diversification is preferable and that active trading is unlikely to be systematically profitable—meeting the STRICT requirement for explicit Evolve-stage demonstration. The advice is tied to their calculations and behavioral interpretation, making the evolution from analysis to strategy clear and defensible.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly contrasts EMH theory with behavioral finance, cites concrete behavioral mechanisms (social influence, emotional trading, loss aversion), and ties those to observed outcomes and computed abnormal returns—fulfilling the Reflect requirement. The treatment is clear, explicit, and linked to empirical results, meeting the STRICT expectation for an explicit synthesis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the three EMH forms and applies them to the GameStop episode with both qualitative (momentum/overshooting) and quantitative (CAPM/abnormal return) evidence, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment lacks depth and rigor (no formal statistical tests, limited examples beyond GameStop), so the work is correct but not comprehensive—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and computes abnormal returns (actual minus expected) and implements a CAPM-based expected return in code, demonstrating basic event-study mechanics. However, they do not document key event-study methodology details (event/estimation windows, model specification, statistical tests or cumulative abnormal returns), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly addresses how markets incorporated new public information (identifying event responses and computing abnormal returns) and interprets multi-day overshooting, showing conceptual understanding. However, the analysis lacks formal event-study details (explicit event/estimation windows, timing metrics, statistical significance tests), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Daniel —\n\nI’ve seen a clear shift in how you approach problems: you’ve moved from ad-hoc tinkering to a DRIVER-style pipeline where questions, data, logic and decisions link together. Two concrete strengths stand out: your ability to translate a business question into measurable drivers (you consistently isolate revenue, margin and growth assumptions cleanly), and your steady use of structured outputs (tables and summary metrics) that let a non-technical manager understand the bottom line. Those are exactly the hallmarks of systematic thinking we cultivate — you’re already building reproducible, decision-ready analyses.\n\nFor next steps, treat the remaining gaps as small, high-leverage fixes:\n- Technical implementation: tighten the verification step. For business finance, that means adding simple checks (sanity bounds on margins, conservation checks for cash flows, and sensitivity ranges) so outputs can’t drift into implausible territory. Practically: create a short checklist you run before presenting numbers and a couple of edge-case checks for your models.\n- Following DRIVER more rigorously: make the “Decision” node explicit. After every analysis, write a one-paragraph recommendation that ties model outcomes to a specific managerial action (e.g., pricing move, capex deferral, or hiring pause) and the key assumptions that would reverse that recommendation.\n\nThese changes aren’t about polishing code — they’re about making your analyses trustworthy to executives and investors. Keep treating AI and tools as execution assistants, but maintain that logic guardrail mindset.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that will pay off in any finance role: junior analyst to CFO. Keep iterating—each small habit (checks, explicit decisions, documented assumptions) compounds into the kind of reliable, high-impact thinking organizations pay for. I’m excited to see your next milestone."
