  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem, the dual analytical frameworks, the data sources, and concrete research-design choices (estimation/event windows and return calculations), meeting the strict requirement for clear Define & Discover documentation. Evidence shows a coherent, actionable research design that a reviewer or stakeholder could understand and defend.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides an explicit, actionable framework for analyzing event efficiency: clear research question, chosen analytical lenses, defined windows, required calculations, data sources, and intended visualizations. This level of explicit planning meets the strict Represent requirement and would allow a reviewer or stakeholder to understand and execute the proposed analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission follows a clear, ordered event-study workflow from design through execution and interpretation, with concrete implementation (code, regression estimates, CARs, plots). While not exhaustive on statistical robustness, the methodological steps are systematically executed and documented, meeting the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets violations of the weak and semi-strong forms and links empirical results to behavioral explanations, but treatment is brief and omits discussion of the strong form and deeper examples/implications. This demonstrates correct understanding but not the thorough, comprehensive coverage required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements core event-study steps (estimation/event windows, market-model OLS, abnormal and cumulative returns) and reports model estimates, so methodology is present and applied. However the treatment lacks depth on validation (statistical significance, window choice justification, robustness checks) and broader methodological detail, so it meets a correct but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct use of event-study elements (windows, expected/abnormal returns, computation via code) indicating a basic understanding of how to test information incorporation. However, the analysis lacks depth on timing/speed (e.g., intraday response, precise adjustment timing), statistical significance, and robustness checks, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Ethan — I want to celebrate how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. Your submissions consistently structure problems around Drivers → Inputs → Validations → Experiments → Results. That clarity — for example, isolating revenue growth drivers, explicitly listing assumptions, and validating outputs with simple sanity checks — shows you’re moving from “monkey mind” guesses to repeatable financial thinking. Your written explanations are getting sharper: you tie model outputs back to business implications rather than just listing numbers, which is exactly the systematic habit we want.\n\nNext steps to deepen impact (practical, business-focused):\n- Tighten core financial mechanics: be explicit about timing of cash flows and how working capital changes feed the cash flow statement. Practice a 3-statement walkthrough for one real company in the sector you care about — start with last 3 years’ working capital drivers and project forward.\n- Clarify discounting and hurdle-rate logic: create a one-page checklist for WACC inputs (beta choice, capital structure, country premium) and a short note linking each input to business risk. Use this checklist before any valuation.\n- Strengthen scenario integration: formalize two-to-three scenario templates (base, downside, upside) and run sensitivity tables on the 2–3 biggest drivers you identify. Present results as “what to watch” KPIs for management.\n\nKeep going — your systematic approach is a career multiplier. Finance roles reward people who can turn messy business problems into disciplined experiments; you’re already on that path. Treat DRIVER as a lifelong toolkit: iterate, validate with real company data, and your ability to influence decisions will grow month by month. I’m excited to see your next model and the sharper business recommendations that will come from it."
