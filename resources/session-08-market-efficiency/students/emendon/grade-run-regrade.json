  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, states objectives, identifies analysis frameworks (EMH forms and behavioral), and lists data/tools—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly presented a clear plan/layout (tools, data source, cleaning, windows, expected-return and abnormal-return calculations, and visualization) and then implemented that plan, meeting the STRICT requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, organized implementation workflow from data acquisition through model estimation and visualization, producing multiple outputs (returns, alpha/beta, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and validating results. This demonstrates systematic execution of Python-based analysis per the DRIVER Implement requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies all three EMH forms and applies empirical methods (regression, abnormal returns) to test them, showing conceptual understanding and some application (Discover + Implement). However, treatment is brief and incomplete—they state weak and semi-strong violations but provide limited depth, discussion, or evidence regarding the strong-form case or more thorough justification—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements core event-study steps (data download, estimation/event windows, expected-return model via OLS, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) demonstrating practical understanding (Implement + Discover). However, treatment lacks depth on important testing details (e.g., window lengths justification, statistical significance, robustness checks, model assumptions), so the work is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct event-study mechanics and produces abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns, showing conceptual ability to measure information effects (Discover + Implement). However, they do not analyze the timing/velocity of information incorporation (no detailed intraday/timing analysis, statistical significance, or linkage to specific news timestamps), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Ethan — I’ve seen a real shift in how you approach problems: you moved from ad-hoc calculations to deliberately laying out drivers, assumptions, and decision rules before touching any numbers. That discipline shows in the way you consistently built models around core cash‑flow drivers (revenue per unit, churn, and contribution margin) and documented the logic behind each assumption. Your habit of writing out \"if–then\" guardrails for edge cases and using AI to generate scenario narratives has made your analyses far more defensible and repeatable — exactly the DRIVER transformation I hope for.\n\nNext steps to push this further: translate those cleaner models into business-ready outputs. For working-capital or capital-budget decisions, run structured stress tests (best/base/worst) and show how each driver maps to P&L, balance sheet, and cash-flow impacts over 12–24 months. Practice turning a model’s key sensitivities into two deliverables executives use: a one-page decision memo and a sensitivity chart that ties changes in a single driver to EBIT and free cash flow. Also tighten your assumption sourcing: annotate each assumption with a primary source or a simple proxy so stakeholders can challenge or update them without breaking the model.\n\nKeep treating thinking as the product, and code/AI as the execution helpers. That mindset—systematic, sourceable, and stakeholder-focused—is exactly what makes you valuable in finance roles: you won’t just produce numbers, you’ll produce decisions. This is a multi-year craft; you’re on the right path. I’m excited to see how you translate these next steps into real business outcomes."
