  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Damian Lopez and this is the Section 6 assignment, the Market Efficiency Investigation. The overview is that I need to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. As the case study, I need to verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or the or if it can be explained with existing frameworks the first step is to verify the statement game stop traded at zero zero dollars and four cents in August of 2020 which I can show that that statement is incorrect because in August of 2020 it was trading between a dollar and one cent and a dollar and 79 cents with the adjustment closing of being a dollar sixty-seven for August of 2020. So that statement is incorrect. And to determine the appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor, I guess I could say something in an email or something that I was working on the case GameStop case study and I noted noticed that this statement was incorrect I checked the historical price data using the Yahoo Finance website and I checked that the adjusted close in August of 2020 was a $1.67 and that it was roughly started it opened at was it a dollar and one cent and it closed at $1.79 and that the driver assignment requires verifying historical claims before proceeding I just wanted to confirm whether we should treat that four cent figure as a typo or if it was intended as a different data source let's see some of the timelines key data points and then required analysis is to verify all these stated historical price data and document corrections test which former market efficiency the week semi strong or strong was violated evaluate whether rational investors could have profited systematically compare efficient market hypothesis prediction to observe behavior and assess behavior finance explanations for observed anomalies on to the define and discover essentially I had a research question which was did the GameStop event violate the market efficiency what market efficient market hypothesis which is false and I showed that using the Yahoo Finance website the onto the represent stage I can show using the code added the estimation window has been roughly D minus 250 to the minus 31 trading days which we use as a market model to compute the of abnormal returns, test the cumulative abnormal returns, run robustness checks, and integrate behavior and evidence like social media activity and short interest. onto the implement stage, which we have the parameters at GameStop, SPY, the start of January 1, 2020, ending in December 31st, 2022. The estimation gap is 30, which was before the event mmm and I had the code the code AI fetches data the GME from the finance Yahoo Finance download it and the SPY edit here choose the primary event and squeeze peak the estimation window and then market model wanted it wanted it to show the market model parameter, the estimation windows. Also compute the abnormal returns and the event study windows as well as compute sample around the event and then the t-test on the cumulative abnormal returns at the event window using the standard event study variance and then the variance of the cumulative abnormal returns which are the sum of the squared residential model variance model times v1 plus 1 divided by the number of estimated window and then also had the AI code plot these results and then also the create an output summary table which include three outputs so here we can see the just a close price spiking which is during the squeeze peak and then then afterwards you know going back down steadily to its normal price here we have a little chart showing the GME volume which also showing it at the squeeze peak peak being at its maximum and then eventually or almost immediately dying down going back to its fairly steady volume as well as the cumulative of normal returns these are all the values that we used or AI used using the Yahoo Finance models the size and the speed of the abnormal returns were inconsistent with the efficient pricing which are based on the public fundamentals which the event drivers are extremely high short interest and the retail coordination via the social media and then the liquidity margin constraints um that explains why the arbitrage failed to um immediately um it explains why the arbitrage failed to immediately restore its prices which behavioral behavioral mechanic mechanisms mechanisms such as a hurting or social amplification market microstructure explaining the outcome without concluding that the markets are always inefficient here we have the Cato Institute Journal or this case study see that I had 140% as the measured by the ratio of short interest of shares available for trading had a sudden and drastic increase in price and in return volatility which was used by reddit the social media platform a large it was used by or initiated by a large amount of retail investors using the Robin Hood financial platform and after this or during this event Robin Hood imposed trading restrictions based on January 28th through the 29th which banned new long positions in GameStop and other stocks which it triggered a uproar and it obviously retreated back from its January high some recommendations include being more transparent with the short entrance interest better stress capital for brokers or clear houses to limit speculative leverage for investor education I began my driver process with verifying the critical gate critical first step I documented the dnr stages prior to implementation and use codes and visuals that are reproducible now thank you",
