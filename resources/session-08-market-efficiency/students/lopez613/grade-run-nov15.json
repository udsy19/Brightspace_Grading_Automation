  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem and lays out a concrete research design (which EMH forms to test, event-study components, estimation windows, data sources, and robustness/integration of behavioral evidence). They also document DRIVER-stage planning and validation steps, meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, explicit represent-stage framework—specifying estimation window, market model, event-study metrics (abnormal returns, CARs), robustness checks, and integration of behavioral/alternative data—which meets the strict requirement for an explicit research design. The plan is concrete and tied to implementation parameters, so it demonstrates a high-quality framework for analyzing efficiency around the event.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, organized implementation plan and describes stepwise execution (data parameters, estimation window, abnormal-return/CAR computation, t-tests), produced multiple outputs (plots, summary tables), and planned robustness checks—demonstrating a systematic event-study workflow. While some technical details rely on AI, the methodological execution and outputs are explicitly described and meet the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the EMH forms as testable and proposes appropriate event-study tests and behavioral explanations, showing conceptual understanding and methodological intent. However, they do not provide thorough, explicit definitions or a detailed, conclusive comparison of weak vs. semi-strong vs. strong form violations, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the event-study methodology components (estimation window, market model, abnormal returns, CAR, and statistical testing) and shows implementation intent, so demonstrates conceptual understanding. However, they did not present detailed calculations, explicit formulas or final statistical results/interpretation, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and plans appropriate event-study tests and discusses that the speed and magnitude of returns deviated from fundamentals, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they do not present detailed timing analyses, quantitative results, or formal statistical conclusions about how quickly information was incorporated, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Damian — I want to start by recognizing how clearly your thinking has shifted. You’ve moved from ad-hoc answers to a repeatable DRIVER process: you decompose complex valuation questions into discrete drivers, state clear hypotheses before modeling, and use AI as an execution assistant rather than a crutch. In your last assignment I particularly appreciated the way you mapped revenue drivers to unit economics and framed the problem as a decision — that kind of structure is exactly what turns “monkey mind” impulses into reliable analysis.\n\nFor next steps, focus your energy where the framework meets financial reality. A few concrete actions:\n- Tighten financial concept checks: when estimating discount rates, terminal growth, or risk premiums, add a one-page justification linking each assumption to market data or comparable companies. This prevents plausible but inaccurate inputs from skewing decisions.\n- Build guardrails around model outputs: run sensitivity and scenario analyses (best/worst/base) and highlight which inputs change the recommended action. That connection — from model sensitivity to a business decision threshold — will make your work actionable for nontechnical stakeholders.\n- Strengthen integration of finance and technology: tie model outputs to P&L and cash-flow implications (e.g., how a 1% volume drop affects EBITDA and cash burn). Add a short validation step comparing model forecasts to historical trends or simple backtests.\n\nKeep treating this as a journey. The systematic habits you’re forming — explicit drivers, hypothesis-first thinking, and disciplined assumptions — are the enduring skills top finance roles reward. Stay curious, keep refining those guardrails, and know I’m excited to see where you take this next."
