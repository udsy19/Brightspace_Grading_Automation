You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, specific understanding of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH forms and links them to empirical results (event-study CARs, t‑stats) and interpretation. The DRIVER stages show a structured approach from question definition through implementation and reflection, supporting a thorough treatment of the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly specified and executed an event-study methodology (model, estimation and event windows, AR/CAR calculations) and produced quantitative results (alphas/betas, CAR magnitudes, t‑stats) for multiple events. The DRIVER stages show a complete workflow from design through implementation and validation, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of market-efficiency testing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student designed and executed an event‑study to measure how quickly markets incorporated information (explicit windows, CAPM estimation, AR/CAR). They produced quantitative results for multiple events (CARs, t‑stats) and interpreted timing patterns (pre‑event spikes, event‑day responses), providing a thorough, applied assessment of information incorporation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly designed and executed abnormal‑return calculations and reported quantitative outputs, demonstrating personal implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough or detailed explanation of specific functions/verification steps (ownership-level detail), so the implementation is correct but not demonstrated with the explicit technical transparency required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed clear internal/data and statistical checks (data filtering, computed t‑stats) demonstrating validation effort. However, they did not cite or compare results against independent external references or tools (news sources, regulator data, or alternate datasets), so validation is present but lacks the external corroboration required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sharanya — I want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted from ad‑hoc intuition to a repeatable, DRIVER‑style process. You consistently demonstrated mastery of core financial concepts (your cash‑flow logic, discounting intuition, and sensitivity reasoning were crisp), integrated finance with technology smartly (your use of structured inputs and automated checks showed you see tech as a guardrail, not the goal), and communicated assumptions and conclusions with clarity. That combination — precise finance reasoning plus deliberate, documented steps — is exactly the “systematic thinker” I look for.\n\nNow, next steps to sharpen the one remaining area: technical implementation. Think of this as turning your rigorous analysis into decision‑ready artifacts that managers can use. Practical actions:\n- Create a short, repeatable template for each business task (FP&A forecast, DCF valuation, scenario stress test) that lists inputs, assumptions, logic flow, and outputs so a non‑expert can follow your reasoning.\n- Pair every model with a one‑page “decision memo” that states the key sensitivities and recommended actions under different scenarios — this bridges analysis to business decisions.\n- Run quick robustness checks: a small suite of scenarios (best/base/worst) and a sensitivity table for 3–4 drivers. Reporting these consistently will make your work operationally valuable.\n\nThese are small, high‑leverage routines that translate your cognition into tools leaders rely on. Keep using AI as an execution assistant to automate repetitive checks, but keep the DRIVER logic as the control.\n\nYou’re on a career path where systematic thinking becomes a differentiator — not just for getting answers, but for shaping decisions. Treat this as an unfolding craft: iterate your templates and memos, seek feedback from a real stakeholder, and you’ll keep converting “monkey mind” into strategic influence. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
