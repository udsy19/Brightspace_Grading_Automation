  "personalized_feedback": "Ryan —\n\nI want to call out something concrete: your work over the term shows a clear shift from ad hoc problem solving to deliberate decomposition. You consistently framed problems using DRIVER’s steps, stated assumptions up front, and produced scenario tables that made trade-offs visible — exactly the kind of “logic guardrails” we want. Your use of sensitivity checks and the way you translated model outputs into crisp business questions (e.g., “what level of sales keeps project NPV positive?”) demonstrates real progress toward systematic financial thinking.\n\nNext steps to accelerate that trajectory: tighten a few financial-concept gaps and make the economics more audit-proof. For example, revisit how you estimated the cost of capital and ensure consistent treatment of taxes and working capital across scenarios — small mis-alignments there change investment signals. In your models, flag and document any judgment calls (growth rates, terminal value multiples) so a non-technical stakeholder can trace the logic. Practically, build a one-page decision memo alongside each model that links model outputs to business KPIs (cash runway, breakeven volume, ROI threshold) and includes two stress-test scenarios tailored to the industry context.\n\nKeep leaning into DRIVER’s discipline. Systematic decomposition and clear assumption-tracking are career multipliers — they’ll make your analyses persuasive to managers and faster to iterate when new data arrives. This is a journey: keep iterating your templates, ask for early feedback on assumptions, and treat each case as a mini-experiment. I’m excited to see how you translate this rigor into real business decisions next term."
