While data sourcing and reflection show engagement (Discover/Implement/Reflect), the core conceptual explanation of EMH forms is incorrect and incomplete, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected raw price/volume data and intended an analysis (Discover/Implement) but never describes event-study methodology (estimation/window periods, market model, abnormal return or CAR calculation, or statistical testing). Their interpretation confuses raw metrics with efficiency testing (the \"zero means weak\" statement), showing fundamental misunderstanding, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student observed rapid price movement but provides no analysis of how quickly or accurately new information was incorporated (no discussion of event windows, reaction timing, benchmarks, or tests).

  "personalized_feedback": "Ryan — I’ve enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation this term. You’ve moved from ad-hoc intuition to a far more systematic approach: your frameworks for breaking down valuation problems, your habit of stating assumptions up front, and the way you mapped data inputs to decision levers all show real growth. In particular, your clear decomposition of a project into Drivers, Inputs, and Risks demonstrated the exact kind of logic guardrail we want — that’s the signature of a developing “systematic thinker.”\n\nNext steps to keep that momentum: focus on tightening a few finance fundamentals that will immediately improve business impact. Work on these concrete items:\n- Cash flows and valuation: practice producing a cash-flow-driven DCF from raw financial statements and show how changes in revenue drivers affect enterprise value. Use a 3–5 year projection horizon and spell out working-capital assumptions.\n- Risk and return metrics: rehearse calculating and interpreting sensitivity, scenario, and break-even analyses so you can communicate downside to stakeholders.\n- Capital structure and cost of capital: run simple WACC exercises and link financing choices to project returns in an FP&A or M&A context.\n- Forecast robustness: stress-test your projections (best/worst/base) and flag which assumptions would change a go/no-go decision.\n\nOn technical execution and following DRIVER, continue the pattern you’ve started: make the decision rule explicit (what triggers action), document inputs, and include quick sanity checks in every model so non-technical managers can trust conclusions.\n\nThis is a career skill, not a one-off assignment. Systematic thinking — the habit of mapping business questions to measurable drivers and testable assumptions — is what prepares you for roles in FP&A, corporate development, and strategy. Keep iterating: treat each model as an experiment, gather feedback, and refine. I’m excited to see where you take this framework next term. Keep pushing the logic, and keep translating it into clear business recommendations."
