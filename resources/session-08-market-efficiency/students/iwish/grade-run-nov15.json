  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and applied them to the GameStop case with concrete evidence (price verification, charts, short-interest/public-info examples) and planned quantitative checks. Their DRIVER workflow (specifically Implement and Reflect) shows deliberate testing and reasoned conclusions, demonstrating a thorough conceptual grasp meriting PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, identified relevant events and hypotheses, and outlined a concrete research design (data verification, event-date alignment, reaction-timing test). They also executed the initial data-check that validates their design, demonstrating clear and complete Define & Discover work.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, actionable framework for testing market efficiency around specific events (hypotheses, event-dates, market benchmark, abnormal-return metric) and demonstrated initial implementation (data import, charts, data validation). That explicit planning plus concrete execution of the first steps satisfies the Represent criterion at the required standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described event-study methodology and the abnormal-return concept and showed data collection and planned regression steps, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform or present the actual abnormal-return calculations or event-study results, so the work is incomplete and merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed and illustrated the information-incorporation question with timeline references and charts and explicitly argued delayed incorporation of public information. However, they did not perform formal timing tests (event-window/abnormal-return calculations) to quantify how quickly information was reflected, so the treatment is conceptually sound but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied herding and overconfidence to explain the GameStop event and used data/visuals to support those claims, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: other listed biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) were not discussed or illustrated in depth, and no quantitative behavioral analysis was presented, so the score is PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Isabella — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered instincts to a disciplined, repeatable approach. Your analyses consistently apply core finance concepts correctly (your cash-flow logic and discount-rate reasoning were especially clear), and I can see you deliberately breaking problems into DRIVER-style steps: you define the business question, lay out assumptions, and use structured scenarios. That kind of explicit decomposition is exactly the shift from “monkey mind” to systematic thinker I look for.\n\nFor next steps, treat the two remaining growth areas as targeted experiments rather than critiques. First, on the technical-implementation item that needs attention: add simple, business-focused validation checks to your models — e.g., balance-sheet identities, sign checks on cash flows, and one or two edge-case scenarios (very high growth, zero revenue). Those checks make your work auditable and trustworthy for a CFO or investor review. Second, on the DRIVER-following item: strengthen the “R” and “I” steps by documenting the rationale behind each key assumption and mapping model outputs to specific stakeholder metrics (EBITDA, free cash flow, covenant ratios). Practicing this will make your work actionable in budgeting, forecasting, and investment memos.\n\nKeep pushing this way. Systematic thinking isn’t just an academic skill — it’s what lets you scale insight, defend recommendations to senior leaders, and design robust financial strategies under uncertainty.
