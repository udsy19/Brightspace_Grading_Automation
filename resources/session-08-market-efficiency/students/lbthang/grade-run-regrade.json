  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly framed the market-efficiency testing problem, set measurable verification tasks, and documented initial data retrieval/verification steps, satisfying the strict requirement for Define & Discover. Evidence shows clear problem definition and driver-stage activity, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided an explicit, ordered analytic plan in the Represent stage, naming concrete analysis steps and how they connect to other DRIVER stages, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit representation of the analysis. The plan is clear and actionable, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student named and used a specific external source (Yahoo Finance) via Google Colab and reported the comparison outcome, satisfying the Validate-stage requirement for external validation. The evidence shows concrete data/code checks rather than only vague claims, so this criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and uses data-driven DRIVER steps, showing conceptual engagement. However, they misapply definitions (e.g., conflating short-interest/public info with weak-form price-history tests and making contradictory claims about semi-strong validity), so the treatment is correct but incomplete/muddled — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates appropriate discovery and data-implementation steps and a plan to visualize the event, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not present an actual event-study methodology or compute/report abnormal returns, estimation windows, or statistical tests—analysis remained descriptive—so the criterion is only partially met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual awareness that markets may delay or mis-price public information and collected data to investigate this, satisfying partial competence. However, treatment is imprecise and sometimes inconsistent (misapplying EMH form definitions, making contradictory claims about semi-strong efficiency) and lacks rigorous analysis of the speed/accuracy of information incorporation, so it does not meet the thorough standard for PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Lal — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve adopted the DRIVER way of thinking. You’ve moved from ad-hoc intuition to a repeatable workflow: you consistently decompose problems into Drivers, set explicit assumptions, and run scenario comparisons rather than relying on a single point estimate. Your habit of documenting assumptions and using sensitivity checks shows real progress in turning “monkey mind” into structured analysis — exactly the kind of systematic thinking that separates reactive analysts from strategic finance professionals.\n\nFor next steps, focus on a few concrete actions that will tighten the bridge between your finance logic and practical business outcomes:\n- Strengthen financial-concept accuracy by cross-checking model inputs with market or company filings (e.g., reconcile revenue drivers to unit economics or historical seasonality). This reduces scope for subtle timing or unit errors when models inform decisions like pricing or capex.\n- Improve technical implementation reliability by building simple validation tests: cash-flow conservation checks, sign/period consistency, and scenario reproducibility. These are low-effort guardrails that pay off when stakeholders act on your numbers.\n- Deepen integration of finance and tech by packaging one project as a short case study for decision-making (e.g., a 3-scenario NPV analysis for a product launch) and highlighting how assumptions map to business levers.\n\nKeep treating analysis as an iterative craft. Systematic thinking will compound in your career — the clearer your logic, the more persuasive your recommendations will be. I’m excited to see which business problems you tackle next; stay curious, keep documenting your logic, and let DRIVER guide those choices."
