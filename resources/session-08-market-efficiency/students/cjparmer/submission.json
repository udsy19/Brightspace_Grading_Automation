  "transcript": "I. Introduction: The GME Anomaly and Factual Verification Hello We are presenting an event study and analysis of the GameStop (GME) short squeeze event of 2020 and 2021. Our primary objective is to evaluate the event against the core principles of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). First, we must verify the historical facts provided in the assignment. The claim that GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020 is incorrect. Actual historical data shows that in August 2020, GME was trading around the $21 price level. Our analysis concludes that the GME short squeeze represents a major, temporary violation of market efficiency. Prior to the event, GME was a fundamentally challenged, brick-and-mortar retailer with weak financials, including negative revenue growth and a high valuation multiple relative to its earnings. The subsequent market surge, therefore, confirms a failure of informational efficiency concerning intrinsic value. II. The Structural Fuel and Behavioral Catalyst This extraordinary price dislocation required two specific conditions: an extreme structural vulnerability and a powerful, coordinated behavioral shock. The vulnerability was the institutional short position against GME. Short interest peaked at an astonishing 141% of the public float in January 2021. Short interest exceeding 100% is possible when the same shares are repeatedly lent out by successive purchasers. This technical concentration created a highly combustible environment where a price rise would force mandatory buy-backs, or a short squeeze. The catalyst was the coordinated collective buying by retail investors, primarily organized on social media platforms like Reddit. This rapid communication facilitated herding behavior and social informedness , instantly amplifying demand. Driven by cognitive biases—including the fear of missing out (FOMO) and a collective \"diamond hands\" strategy (avoiding regret by holding onto positions) —this shock drove the price from approximately $17 to an extreme pre-split peak of over $500 per share. This approximately 30-fold increase, absent any corresponding fundamental improvement, is a textbook market anomaly. III. Testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis We assessed the event against the three forms of the EMH: 1. Weak Form Efficiency: This form suggests that historical prices cannot predict future returns. The GME event challenges this. The predictable momentum and volatility clustering, driven by the technical short-squeeze mechanism, demonstrate clear, non-random price behavior in the short term, allowing temporary exploitation by momentum traders. 2. Semi-Strong Form Efficiency (Violated): This form states that all public information should be accurately reflected in the price. The GME price trajectory, inflated to levels fundamentally incompatible with the company's bleak long-term business outlook, confirms a significant violation. The market prioritized the temporary technical signal (the short squeeze potential) over the established fundamental signal (deteriorating sales). 3. Strong Form Efficiency: This requires prices to reflect even insider information. The event reinforces the practical rejection of this form, as large, sophisticated institutional investors who possessed critical information about the size and risk of their own short positions were unable to anticipate or defend against the retail shock. IV. Failure of Rationality: The Limits to Arbitrage The most critical insight from GME is the validation of the Limits to Arbitrage (LTA) hypothesis. Arbitrageurs—the short-selling hedge funds—were constrained by liquidity risk and implementation costs, preventing them from correcting the mispricing. The rising price triggered devastating, mandatory margin calls. Highly leveraged firms like Melvin Capital, facing potential liquidation, sustained a 49% loss in the first months of 2021, requiring a $3 billion institutional bailout. This confirms that the organized noise trader risk was non-diversifiable and simply overwhelmed the capacity of rational capital to intervene. This situation was compounded by a microstructure failure. At the peak of volatility, app-based brokerages like Robinhood restricted buying because they lacked the internal liquidity to meet the sudden, massive collateral deposit requirements demanded by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). This regulatory constraint, implemented for the firms' own solvency, created an artificial downward pressure on the stock price, confirming that structural constraints can override market efficiency. V. Conclusion and Policy Implications While the GME event yielded massive ex-post profits (actual realized returns) for early participants, the extreme volatility means it is difficult to argue that it offered systematic, low-risk ex-ante (forecastable) profitability. Active trading in this speculative environment is a risky bet, not a systematic strategy. The episode did not kill the EMH, but it proved that market efficiency is conditional, validating the LTA framework. This led to critical regulatory scrutiny focused on : 1. Short Selling Transparency: Addressing the extreme leverage seen in the 141% short interest. 2. Market Structure: Reviewing clearinghouse margin rules to prevent future brokerage liquidity crises and mandated trading restrictions. 3. Digital Engagement: Scrutinizing the use of gamification features on trading platforms and the role of social media influencers to protect retail investors from excessive risk. The GME short squeeze stands as a powerful case study demonstrating how technology and collective human psychology can temporarily dominate market fundamentals, forcing a re-evaluation of how markets function in the 21st century.",
