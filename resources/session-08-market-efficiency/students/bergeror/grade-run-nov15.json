  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the research problem, event window, hypotheses, data source, and planned empirical measures (abnormal/CAR), meeting the Define & Discover requirements. Although implementation details follow later, the initial research design and objectives are stated explicitly and coherently, satisfying this strict DRIVER criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly synthesizes EMH theory with behavioral finance, applies that synthesis to the GameStop episode, and names concrete behavioral mechanisms supported by their empirical observations. This demonstrates a clear, defensible reflective understanding consistent with the DRIVER Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and labels weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies them to the GameStop case (demonstrating conceptual understanding and empirical effort), but the treatment is basic and contains conceptual slippage (e.g., unclear reasoning about why the weak form was \"violated\") and lacks deeper, rigorous justification. Thus the work shows correct but incomplete mastery consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and computes abnormal/cumulative abnormal returns and produced graphical results (implementation evidence), showing practical engagement. However, the submission lacks methodological detail (no estimation window, benchmark/model for expected returns, or statistical testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding and produced empirical plots of abnormal returns, indicating some assessment of how new information (social media/news) moved prices. However, the submission lacks rigorous analysis of timing and accuracy (no explicit event window, benchmark model, or statistical tests of how quickly prices incorporated information), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Robby — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from ad-hoc thinking to a clear DRIVER-style approach. You’ve shown concrete progress in grounding financial concepts (your analyses increasingly tie assumptions to cash-flow impacts), integrating finance with technology (your models link data inputs to decision levers), and following the DRIVER steps consistently—your problem definitions, identified drivers, and decision rules are becoming reliably systematic. Your explanations are getting clearer too: when you walk through a scenario, I can see the logic trail from premise to conclusion.\n\nNext steps to push this further: treat technical implementation gaps as business-risk controls. In practice that means (a) codify and document key assumptions and failure modes for each model — a short “assumption sheet” that non-technical stakeholders can read, (b) add simple sensitivity checks to every output (what changes if growth is ±1–3 points?), and (c) run one structured peer review per model, focused on “what would make a CFO reject this?” These steps keep you from getting tripped up by edge cases and make your work boardroom-ready. For the single technical area that needs attention, pick one recurring bug or inconsistency, map its root cause, and create a repeatable fix (checklist, test, or guardrail) so it doesn’t recur.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a professional habit, not a classroom exercise. Systematic thinking is one of the highest-leverage skills you can develop: it makes your analyses faster to trust, easier to scale, and far more influential in business discussions. You’re on a clear trajectory—stay curious about the “why” behind exceptions, use simple controls to manage risk, and keep translating complexity into crisp decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
