  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, repeatable event‑study workflow—data selection with explicit date range, tabulation, CAPM/OLS implementation, computation of ARs/CARs with significance testing, and charting—producing multiple organized outputs. While some methodological specifics (e.g., explicit estimation vs event window parameters) are not deeply detailed, the implemented, systematic approach and produced results meet the criterion for a PASS under the moderate DRIVER standard.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student explicitly checked the prompt's numeric claim, ran code against the stated date range, produced tables and summary statistics, and documented that the claimed $0.04 price is inconsistent with observed historical prices (min $14). This satisfies the requirement to verify numerical claims and record discrepancies.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a basic, correct awareness of EMH forms and applies an event-study methodology (Implement + Discover), but their definitions are imprecise and their conclusion is inconsistent (they report significant abnormal returns yet claim \"strong form\" efficiency). This shows partial conceptual understanding but not the thorough, accurate treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates core event-study steps (data selection, OLS/CAPM estimation, ARs and CARs, basic significance testing), showing functional understanding. However, treatment is high-level and lacks methodological detail (estimation window choices, model specification, robustness/standardization, and some misinterpretations), so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns and performed significance testing (Implement + Discover), showing understanding of event-study mechanics. However, they do not address timing (how quickly returns adjust) or justify event/estimation window choices, and their interpretation is inconsistent (significant ARs yet claiming strong-form efficiency), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jon — I’ve really enjoyed watching your DRIVER conversion from scattered ideas into a repeatable problem-solving process. You’ve shown clear progress in applying financial concepts to structured analyses: your cash-flow mapping and attempt to align drivers with outcomes made it obvious you’re thinking in terms of business levers, not just numbers. You also advanced in integrating finance with technology — your willingness to use AI to execute routine steps and to build checks into your workflow shows growing discipline. Finally, your communication has become more deliberate: your explanations now follow a logical thread that makes it easier for others to follow your assumptions.\n\nFor next steps, let’s tighten a couple of areas so your models are both credible and useful in real business settings. First, the remaining gap in financial-concept accuracy looks like inconsistent handling of timing and working-capital effects. Practice by building a short 3-year operating forecast for a simple product business and explicitly reconcile quarterly-to-annual timing and AR/AP changes. Second, the technical implementation issue can be addressed by adding logic guardrails: implement explicit validation checks (sum-to-zero reconciliations, sign checks, and scenario sanity tests) and document the assumptions that each check relies on. These are directly applicable to budgeting, M&A diligence, and investor reporting — they turn models from “plausible” to defensible.\n\nKeep treating AI as your execution assistant and your code as a logic guardrail rather than an end in itself. If you continue iterating—map drivers, encode assumptions, test edge cases—you’ll build the kind of systematic thinking finance teams prize. This is a career-long craft; your trajectory is strong, and I’m excited to see where you take it next."
