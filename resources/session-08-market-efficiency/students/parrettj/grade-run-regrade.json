  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (the verification question) and identified the datasets and exact event window used to investigate it, meeting the required Define & Discover evidence. The statements show clear, personal framing of the task and data collection sufficient for this DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear plan/layout: collect and tabulate price/return data, estimate expected returns via an OLS/CAPM model, compute abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, perform significance tests, and visualize results. Those explicit steps constitute a concrete representational plan for analyzing market efficiency and meet the strict requirement for this DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow—data acquisition, tabulation, model estimation, statistical calculation, and visualization—producing multiple outputs (tables, stats, charts) that implement the planned analysis. While some low-level methodological details are omitted, the end-to-end systematic execution meets the moderate DRIVER Implement standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected and analyzed event-return data (Discover/Implement) and correctly computed abnormal returns and significance. However their interpretation of EMH forms is confused and incorrect (they equate significant abnormal returns with \"strong\" or \"weak form\" efficiency), so the conceptual understanding of weak/semi-strong/strong forms is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates key elements of an event study (data collection, model estimation, abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return calculation, and statistical testing), but treatment is high-level and lacking methodological specifics (e.g., precise model specification, estimation window, how expected returns were computed/validated, and robustness checks). Thus the work is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performed the core event-study calculations (abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, significance testing) showing partial mastery of information incorporation methods. However they did not analyze timing/velocity of information assimilation (event-window dynamics, estimation-window choices, or robustness) and misinterpreted EMH forms, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jon —\n\nI want to celebrate how you’ve embraced the DRIVER way of thinking. Over the past weeks I’ve noticed you move from ad-hoc calculations to clearly structured problem solving: you now define objectives up front, state assumptions explicitly, and walk through consequences step by step. That systematic layout—your consistent use of a problem statement, inputs, model logic, and conclusions—makes it much easier for a business partner to follow your reasoning. I also saw clear progress in integrating finance and technology: your models are more reproducible and your explanations are becoming more tied to business context (great progress on translating model outputs into decision-relevant language).\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact. There’s one financial-concepts area that still needs tightening — double-check core assumptions that feed valuation and forecasting (for example: discount rates, terminal growth, and cash-flow definitions). Actionable moves: 1) explicitly map each model input to a line on the pro forma statements so you can trace currency of numbers; 2) run sensitivity/scenario tables around the key assumption(s) that caused the discrepancy to show how decisions change; 3) document why you chose a particular rate or metric (cite industry comps or company risk drivers). On communication, convert your technical conclusions into a 2–3 bullet executive summary and one decision rule (e.g., “Proceed if NPV > X at base case and IRR > hurdle in >50% of scenarios”). Those are immediately usable in FP&A meetings or investment memos.\n\nKeep going—this is a career-defining habit. Systematic thinking is what separates analysts who crunch numbers from advisors who make decisions. You’re on that path; treat each model as a tiny business decision lab, iterate, and you’ll keep turning monkey-mind into dependable judgement.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
