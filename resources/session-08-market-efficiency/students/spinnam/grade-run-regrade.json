  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, correct event-study workflow and abnormal-return calculation, includes implementation details (event window, returns, CAR), and performed multiple validation checks with interpretation. Coverage is thorough and applied, satisfying the criterion for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly tested how quickly and accurately prices incorporated new information using a standard event-study workflow, attention proxies, and multiple validation checks, and they quantified persistence (rapid reversal over days). Their analysis links timing, statistical/economic significance, and behavioral drivers, providing a thorough, applied treatment that satisfies the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran an event-study in Python, shows first-person steps (data loading, daily returns, normal return estimation, abnormal returns = actual − normal, CAR) and reports validation statistics and interpretation. This demonstrates personal execution, block-level description, and ownership of the abnormal-return calculations, meeting the strict technical requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct, well-applied understanding of semi-strong EMH—explaining that event studies test public-information incorporation, showing abnormal/CAR results, and linking behavioral causes and rapid correction. However, they do not address the weak and strong forms of EMH explicitly, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed multiple validation activities—fact-checking prices and short interest and running statistical/bootstrap/persistence tests—showing active validation of data and code outputs. However, they did not cite named external sources or tools (only referenced \"analysts\" and general checks), so the validation is real but not specifically externally documented, which fits PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Sri —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your work reflects the DRIVER transformation. You didn’t just deliver code — you built a logic guardrail around a business problem. Your technical implementation was purposeful: the model inputs, the assumptions you surfaced, and the way you tied outputs back to financial metrics showed strong integration of finance and technology. I also noticed you consistently followed the DRIVER steps in framing the decision, running the analysis, and explaining trade-offs — that kind of systematic decomposition is exactly what turns “monkey mind” reactions into repeatable decision processes.\n\nFor next steps, think about closing the loop between model outputs and business action. Practical, actionable moves you can take:\n- Add structured sensitivity and scenario analysis tied to business triggers (e.g., revenue shock > X% → reallocate working capital). That makes results immediately usable by a CFO or product owner.\n- Implement simple validation and monitoring: track realized vs. forecasted outcomes and surface drift indicators so decision rules can be updated post-implementation.\n- Translate model uncertainty into decision thresholds (stop, pause, scale) rather than raw probabilities — that’s how finance teams operationalize insights.\n- Practice presenting one-page executive narratives that map model results to specific capital or risk-management actions.\n\nKeep treating code as a guardrail and AI as an execution partner. Your growing habit of breaking problems into DRIVER’s steps will be a career multiplier: you’ll be the person who turns ambiguity into repeatable decisions. This is a long arc — you’ve made strong, visible progress. Keep iterating on those business-facing decision rules and monitoring frameworks, and you’ll be invaluable in any finance function."
