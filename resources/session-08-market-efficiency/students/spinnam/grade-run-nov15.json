  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a complete event-study workflow—data verification, explicit event window, return calculations, abnormal return and CAR computation, visualization, and multiple validation tests—showing both methodological and interpretive understanding. This treatment is detailed enough to meet a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations for event-study methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly tests how quickly and accurately new information was incorporated using an appropriate event-study, abnormal-return and CAR framework, plus robustness and persistence checks and attention proxies. Their empirical measurements and interpretation (temporary semi-strong breakdown with quick correction) constitute a thorough, well-supported treatment of information incorporation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student goes beyond basic return calculations by integrating attention proxies, performing multiple robustness checks (bootstrap, persistence, economic vs statistical significance), and interpreting these results to produce data-driven conclusions about drivers and persistence of the anomaly. This combination of empirical methods and translated insights meets the threshold for a thorough, applied treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and applies the semi-strong form (prices reflecting public information) and uses an appropriate event-study implementation to test it, showing conceptual and empirical understanding. However, they do not explicitly discuss the weak and strong forms of EMH nor compare the three forms, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies several behavioral biases (herding/“hurting”, attention bias, FOMO/overconfidence) and integrates behavioral proxies into the empirical workflow, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, treatment is brief and several specified biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed or analyzed in depth, so coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses an appropriate empirical approach to detect anomalies and mentions a repeatable anomaly (post-earnings drift), showing conceptual awareness. However, the submission lacks explicit discussion or analysis of key anomaly classes asked for (momentum, value, size, calendar effects), so coverage is correct but incomplete.",

You consistently tied finance questions to technology in a way that shows real strategic thinking — for example, you mapped business drivers to measurable metrics and used automation to keep those metrics current. That discipline of “translate goal → metric → code guardrail” is exactly the systematic habit we want: you don’t chase tools, you design logic around the business question. That clarity is rare and powerful.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on tightening a few financial-accuracy and implementation habits so your insights carry even more weight in real business settings. Practical next steps:\n- Build quick reconciliation checks into each model (e.g., balance-sheet identities, cash-flow roll-forwards) so errors surface immediately.\n- Add scenario and sensitivity tables that connect model levers to business outcomes (price, volume, margin). Use those to tell a CFO-level story: what changes move EBITDA vs. cash?\n- Before finalizing, document key assumptions (growth rates, working-capital days) and why they’re realistic for the industry — this makes your models defensible in stakeholder conversations.\n- Adopt a short checklist for technical handoffs: units aligned, rounding explained, and version notes for major assumption changes.\n\nKeep treating code as a logic guardrail and AI as an execution assistant — you’ve already internalized that mindset. Systematic thinking like yours is exactly what scales: it turns one-off analyses into repeatable decision tools that senior finance teams rely on. This is a practice, not a finish line. I’m excited to see how you apply these next steps in your next project — you’re on a very promising trajectory."
