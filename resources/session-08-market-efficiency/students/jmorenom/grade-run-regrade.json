  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the market‑efficiency testing problem and scope, and immediately links it to a concrete methodological plan (event study with market model). That explicit definition plus a stated approach meets the strict requirement for this DRIVER stage, so PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a concrete, explicit plan (event windows, model equation, target benchmark, and data source), satisfying the strict requirement for the Represent stage. This level of methodological clarity is sufficient for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission demonstrates a systematic implementation workflow—planning, data acquisition, calculation of abnormal returns, visualization, and significance testing—and applies the results to interpret market efficiency. Under the moderate standard for Implement, this organized end‑to‑end execution warrants a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct, applied understanding of the semi-strong form (explicit framing, event-study method, interpretation of post-announcement drift and limits to arbitrage) but does not address the weak and strong forms of EMH or provide comprehensive, comparative coverage of all three forms. This merits PARTIAL under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies core event-study elements (event window, market model, abnormal returns, and a significance test) showing practical understanding, but treatment is basic and omits important methodological detail (estimation window/period, CAR calculation and standardization, robustness checks). Under the moderate standard this merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and tests information incorporation (event study, abnormal returns, significance testing) and reports evidence of slow incorporation (post-announcement drift). However, the treatment is basic and omits key methodological and quantitative details (estimation window, CAR/CUMAR calculations, timing resolution, robustness), so the work demonstrates understanding but not thorough, comprehensive analysis.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Juan —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER mindset. Your work shows a disciplined approach: you decompose problems into driver-based components, state assumptions up front, and build scenarios that expose which variables truly move outcomes. I especially noticed your clear scenario labeling, logical flow from assumption → calculation → insight, and the way you used sensitivity checks to distinguish noise from value drivers. Those are textbook examples of moving from “monkey mind” reactions to systematic financial thinking.\n\nFor next steps, focus the energy you’ve already invested into three practical areas that unlock business impact:\n- Financial concept clarity: when you model a metric (e.g., EBITDA, working capital, free cash flow), trace it back to the actual accounting line items and typical business drivers (pricing, volume, margin mix). A quick reconciliation to a simple pro forma P&L will catch conceptual gaps and make your outputs usable for CFO-level decisions.\n- Technical robustness for business use: keep your logic modular and annotate key formulas with one-line business rationales. That makes your model easier to hand off in M&A or budgeting contexts and speeds up review cycles.\n- Integration with decision-making: practice converting model outputs into two-page memos tied to a decision (invest/hold/cut). For example, translate scenario outcomes into a prioritized list of levers (price increase, cost control, capex deferment) and estimated profit impact.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as the muscle you’re strengthening. In client meetings, boards, or strategy sessions, the ability to trace a recommendation back to clear drivers will set you apart. This is a career-long journey—stay curious, iterate your models with real business data, and you’ll keep turning complexity into actionable insight.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
