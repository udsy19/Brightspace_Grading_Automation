  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the testing problem and provided a concrete research design (events, window, model), meeting the STRICT requirement for clear, defendable methodology. Evidence shows explicit planning and mapping from question to empirical approach, so this criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit analytical framework—specific event dates, +/-10 business‑day windows, the market‑model equation, and a validation test—meeting the STRICT requirement for an explicit, defendable representational design. This level of explicit planning and linkage to implementation supports a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic event‑study workflow—designing event windows and model, sourcing data, computing/visualizing abnormal returns, and performing a t‑test—demonstrating organized implementation. While some technical/detail depth is limited, the methodological execution is coherent and complete enough to meet the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a correct, applied understanding of the semi-strong form (clear hypothesis, event-study method, and interpretation of post-event drift), but it does not address the weak and strong forms of EMH. Because coverage is accurate for semi-strong but incomplete across the three forms, the score is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework (window, market model, abnormal returns) and ran a significance test, showing conceptual competence. However, key methodological details are missing or shallow (estimation window/parameters, AR→CAR aggregation, inference adjustments and robustness), so treatment is correct but basic—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework and statistical test to evaluate how quickly markets reflected new information, showing conceptual understanding. However, methodological detail and depth are limited (estimation windows, CAR aggregation, intra-day timing, robustness), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Juan —\n\nI’ve watched your DRIVER transformation with real pleasure. You’ve become a methodical thinker: your work consistently follows the DRIVER steps, you frame problems clearly before reaching for tools, and you use AI as an execution partner rather than a crutch. Concretely, your case write-ups show crisp problem definition, clean decomposition into financial drivers, and transparent assumptions — exactly the kind of “logic guardrails” that separate useful models from noisy spreadsheets. Your ability to translate business questions into a sequence of analytical steps is a clear strength.\n\nFor the next stage, focus energy on one technical implementation area so your analyses are not only well-structured but operationally robust. Practical next steps:\n- Build simple sensitivity checks around key assumptions (revenue growth, margin, discount rate) so stakeholders can see outcome ranges quickly.\n- Add small automated tests or plausibility checks (e.g., balance sheet reconciliations, cashflow sign checks) to catch input errors early.\n- Create a short “how-to” summary for each model: inputs, expected outputs, and where to update assumptions. That makes your work usable for FP&A, M&A diligence, or board-level scenario planning.\nThese are not coding critiques — they’re business-controls that make financial analysis trustworthy and scalable.\n\nKeep leaning into the DRIVER habit. Systematic thinking is the career multiplier: it accelerates learning, reduces rework in live deals, and makes you a go-to person for clear, defensible recommendations. This is a journey — you’ve built a strong foundation; the next chapter is operationalizing that clarity so it reliably informs real business decisions. I’m excited to see where you take it next.\n\n— Professor Zhang"
