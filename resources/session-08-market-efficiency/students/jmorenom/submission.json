  "transcript": "hey professor this video is to demonstrate my market efficiency investigation using the game start short squeeze of 2020 to 2021 i'm applying the driver framework to test whether the markets process information efficient or a behavior factors dominated it i want to start by defining the problem the problem is to test the efficient effect efficient market hypotheses specifically the semi-strong form during the game start short squeeze the project also corrects a factual error that simon mentioned gme traded at 0.04 in august 2020 but yahoo finance and stamp moon shows it has about 1.67 split adjusted a roughly 6.68 pre -split so prices were low but nowhere near four cents uh next i represent my plan i'm running an event study with plus 10 businesses uh day windows around the key events so we have november 16 2020 january well number 16 2020 represents ryan cohen's letter to the board january 27 2021 the price peak day and january 28 2021 the robin hood trading restrictions i compare game subs daily returns to sp 500 using market method equation ri equals a plus brm okay and then so i did use y finance to pull gm sp 500 data um the walk okay so initial of these bars right here the bar shows a daily abnormal returns the dash lines markets the event days um the large position sparks means its market didn't instantly prize and in a new info evidence against perfect semi-strong evidence here's CRA committing after the event a pressman race up to day zero implies post announcement drift volume spiked over 10 standard dividend innovations clear hurting behavior and retail momentum so i validated my significance with a one simple t-test of mean abnormal returns some events so ar means uh it's technically different from zero but from an economic view realizing that the profit was nearly impossible due to short sale constrictions and broken holds this connects to limits to limits to a brigade concept from here i i evolve insights to border markets the data suggests markets are most effective but can break down under social media coronations equality stress and structural limits these findings apply beyond equality especially in the less liquid or semi -man driven assets reflecting on this my takeaway is that effectiveness isn't absolute it's adductive a balanced strategy makes sense keep a passive core that respects overall efficiency while using sensitive active analyze where behavior bias or liquidity functions create temporal mispricing that's the instance of combining ehm theory with the behavioral finance reality and this should be it",
