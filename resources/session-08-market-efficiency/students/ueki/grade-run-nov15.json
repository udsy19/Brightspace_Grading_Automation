  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies violations of weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and links each to specific mechanisms (momentum/past prices, detachment from public fundamentals, and social/short-squeeze forces). They support this with quantitative evidence (peak $120.75 vs $10–$40 fundamentals) and a clear DRIVER workflow (discover → implement → reflect), meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency test (objective, time horizon, data sources) and set clear success metrics and benchmarks, demonstrating a concrete research design. The plan to implement data-gathering functions shows methodological intent and satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly contrasted EMH predictions with observed outcomes, quantified the deviation, and provided behavioral mechanisms linking social dynamics and short-squeeze mechanics to the anomaly, demonstrating clear synthesis. Given the concrete data-based comparison and explicit behavioral interpretation, the Reflect criterion is thoroughly met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gathered and compared price data to fundamental benchmarks but did not describe or implement an event-study framework (estimation/event windows, market model, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical inference). DRIVER shows data access and interpretation, but the required methodological steps and abnormal-return computations for formal market-efficiency testing are missing, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding (EMH prediction vs observed behavior) and uses price vs fundamental comparisons as evidence, showing data-driven reflection. However, they did not measure or quantify the speed/accuracy of information incorporation (no event-timing analysis, intraday reaction, or formal metrics), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets herding/social-proof and narrative-driven behavior and links these to the price anomaly with data support, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: other listed biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly analyzed or connected to mechanisms or examples, so the coverage is correct but partial.",

You now decompose finance problems into crisp hypotheses, you document assumptions so someone else can follow your logic, and your sensitivity analyses show you’re thinking about robustness, not just a single answer. Those are concrete signals of systematic thinking that many students don’t reach this semester.\n\nFor the next steps, treat the remaining gaps as targeted experiments:\n- Financial concepts: one area still needs tightening. Pick the single concept (for example, the link between discount rate choice and terminal value) and write a one-paragraph plain-English explanation, then produce two small numeric examples that show how different choices change valuation. That will convert fuzzy intuition into repeatable judgment you can use in real deal work.\n- Technical implementation: add lightweight reconciliation checks to your models — e.g., a one-sheet “trail of inputs” that links each assumption to the output(s) it moves most. This reduces surprises when you hand a model to a manager.\n- Integration of finance and business: whenever you produce a number, pair it with a decision consequence: what would a CFO actually do if revenue falls 10%? Practice producing a two-line action recommendation tied to each scenario.\n\nKeep treating the DRIVER framework as your thinking guardrail: hypothesize, test, reconcile, and communicate. This is a career skill — investors, FP&A leaders, and founders pay for people who can translate numbers into decisions. You're on a strong trajectory; keep iterating with small, testable improvements and you’ll continue to outgrow the class."
