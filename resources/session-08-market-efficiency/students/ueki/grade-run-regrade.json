  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem with objective, time horizon, data sources, success metric, and concrete benchmarks, and proposed a specific data-gathering plan—satisfying the strict requirement for explicit definition in the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a clear plan/layout for the market-efficiency analysis (objective, time horizon, data source, per-question data functions, and benchmarks), satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is actionable and tied to validation metrics, so it meets the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student showed a systematic workflow from plan to execution to validation: they defined per-question data functions, used yfinance to extract daily data, and produced verified numerical outputs that fed their EMH analysis. While not exhaustive (some advanced tests missing), the methodological execution is organized and consistent with the planned implementation, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and applies weak, semi-strong, and strong-form concepts and ties them to empirical comparisons (peak price vs $10–$40 benchmarks), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is brief and lacks thorough justification and deeper evidence (e.g., rigorous tests for weak-form predictability, fuller argumentation for each form), so it meets a correct but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows intent and data collection but contains no event-study methodology or abnormal-return calculations (no estimation/event windows, no model for expected returns, no AR/CAR computation or statistical testing). Because the required methodological elements are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how EMH predicts rapid incorporation of public information and contrasts that with observed price behavior, using data-based comparisons (supporting a conceptual answer). However, the treatment lacks rigorous timing analysis or formal tests (no event windows, news-date alignment, or return-based measures of speed), so the understanding is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Chihiro — I’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. Your work consistently breaks messy problems into clear subquestions, you drive analyses with explicit hypotheses, and you use “logic guardrails” to keep conclusions tied to assumptions. In your last assignment I noticed particularly strong systematic thinking: you mapped each assumption to model outputs, annotated where uncertainty lived, and asked targeted follow-up questions instead of jumping to results. Those are exactly the habits that turn a “monkey mind” into a reliable financial thinker.\n\nFor the next steps, focus those strengths on a few concrete finance issues. First, tighten accuracy around valuation mechanics: double-check timing of cash flows (operating vs. financing flows and non‑recurring items) and ensure your discount rate reflects the proper risk components for the business segment you’re valuing. Second, strengthen model robustness — add explicit validation checks and edge‑case tests so your outputs won’t change unexpectedly when assumptions shift. Third, deepen integration with business decisions: for any model you build, write a one‑paragraph memo that translates the quantitative result into a specific actionable choice (e.g., invest, defer, price change, or financing mix). Practically, run two sensitivity scenarios, reconcile model cash flows to the company’s latest statements, and have a peer review the memo for clarity.\n\nYou’ve built a reliable toolkit; now direct it toward real business questions. Systematic thinking like yours makes you a trusted voice in finance — not because you can code perfectly, but because you can make rigorous, decision‑ready judgments under uncertainty. Keep iterating: treat every model as a hypothesis to be tested, and you’ll continue to grow far beyond class assignments into impactful business decision‑making."
