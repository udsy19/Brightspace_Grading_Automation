  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes and implements an event-study framework (CAPM/OLS for normal returns, AR = Robs − E[R], and CAR) and provides numeric outputs (beta, t‑stat, CAR) with interpretation, demonstrating thorough applied understanding. Minor methodological details (e.g., exact estimation/event windows and CAR significance testing) are not fully specified, but the substantive, implemented analysis meets the standards for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, identifies the implementation blocks/functions, and walks through OLS beta estimation, CAPM expected returns, AR calculation, and CAR aggregation with numeric outputs (beta, t‑stat, CAR). This shows clear personal execution, block‑level methodological understanding, and validation—meeting the strict technical requirements for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem, states the hypothesis, and presents a concrete research design (event‑study with CAPM and AR/CAR computation), plus validated the input data—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct and detailed treatment of weak- and semi-strong-form EMH—using an event study, CAPM-based expected returns, and a quantified CAR (188.53%)—showing solid conceptual and applied understanding. However, the submission does not address strong-form efficiency at all, so the coverage is incomplete and warrants a PARTIAL score.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies an event‑study framework and computes AR/CAR, producing a large CAR (188.53%) and interpreting this as evidence that markets did not quickly and accurately incorporate information. However, the submission omits key methodological detail on timing/significance of AR/CAR (event window length, statistical tests on CAR, explicit measurement of how quickly prices adjusted), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invokes behavioral finance and identifies herding/ coordinated buying and limits to arbitrage as explanations, showing conceptual linkage to the event (Reflect + Implement). However, treatment is incomplete: several specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed or analyzed, so the coverage is correct but partial.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alexandra — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. Your project showed a clear logic guardrail: assumptions were modular, your flow from inputs → calculations → outputs was traceable, and you translated a messy problem into repeatable steps. That shift from ad-hoc tinkering to a structured approach is exactly the transformation DRIVER aims for. I also noticed you used sensitivity checks and documented key assumptions — concrete habits that mark a systematic thinker.\n\nNow for the next steps to deepen impact in real business settings. A few financial-concept areas need focused attention: make cash-flow timing explicit (when exactly flows occur across periods), tighten your discount-rate rationale (link WACC components to observable market data or comparable firms), and reconcile pro forma income with the cash-flow statement and working-capital movements. Actionable checklist:\n- Rebuild one projection timestep as a walk-through: show revenue → cash collections → operating cash → free cash flow.\n- Justify your discount rate with a short appendix: beta source, debt costs, and target capital structure.\n- Add scenario and tail-risk tests that map to business decisions (e.g., go/no-go for a project, covenant breach likelihood).\n\nYou’re already making progress integrating finance and technology — next aim to close the loop by turning model outputs into decision information: a one-page dashboard for an investor meeting, or triggers that feed into a simple capital-allocation rule. Practice presenting three clear decisions your model supports and the assumptions that would change the recommendation.\n\nKeep iterating. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier in FP&A, corporate development, and entrepreneurship — it turns ambiguity into actionable options. Treat this as an ongoing craft: refine assumptions, seek peer review, and let your models speak directly to business choices. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
