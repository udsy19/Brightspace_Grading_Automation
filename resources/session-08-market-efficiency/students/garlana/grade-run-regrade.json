  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined the abnormal-return formula, described and ran code to estimate beta and expected returns, computed daily abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal return, and reported numerical outputs (beta, t‑stat, CAR), demonstrating personal execution and validation. This meets the strict requirement for attempting abnormal return calculations with clear ownership and block-level description, so PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the market‑efficiency testing problem, states the hypothesis and scope (weak‑form EMH, GME event), and frames a measurable indicator of failure (price vs. PV), satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly presented a clear, sequential plan for analyzing market efficiency—event study design, CAPM normal returns, abnormal return formula, and implementation steps (params, beta estimation, OLS, ARs, CAR)—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is concrete and directly mapped to implementation, so PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct and applied understanding of weak and semi-strong forms (conceptual explanation plus quantitative event-study evidence), but coverage is incomplete—the strong form is not addressed and discussion lacks a comprehensive treatment of all three EMH forms. Hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements core event‑study steps (estimation via OLS/CAPM, abnormal return formula, and CAR) and reports specific outputs (beta, t‑stat, CAR), showing practical application. However, the treatment lacks methodological detail and rigor (e.g., explicit estimation/event window definitions, variance/significance testing for CAR, robustness checks), so the work is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies event‑study methods and presents concrete results (beta, daily ARs, 188.53% CAR) showing prices did not reflect fundamentals in the short run, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks precise analysis of incorporation speed (e.g., intraday timing, formal significance/variance testing of CAR, robustness/window sensitivity), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alexandra — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from piecewise problem-solving to a reproducible, DRIVER-style workflow. You nailed the technical implementation and consistently used the “logic guardrail” mindset: your notebooks show clear inputs → transformations → outputs, and you framed the AI prompts as execution assistants rather than substitutes. That discipline — separating assumptions, mechanics, and conclusions — is exactly the systematic thinking we teach, and it shows in how you trace results back to specific assumptions.\n\nNext steps to make this even more business-ready: translate that system into clearer financial reasoning and stakeholder communication. Concretely:\n- When you build a projection, attach a one-paragraph rationale for each major assumption (revenue growth, margins, working capital). Link each to a financial statement line and to a real decision (pricing, hiring, capex).\n- Add a sensitivity matrix (best/worst/base) for 2–3 high-leverage variables and show how each scenario changes cash flow and key ratios. That lets a CFO or investor see how robust a recommendation is.\n- Practice boiling your model into a 2-minute executive summary: key drivers, biggest risks, recommended action. Try writing an investor-style memo or a CFO-facing slide with a single takeaway per chart.\n\nKeep treating code and AI as guardrails — they speed execution, but the value you add is the judgment that connects numbers to decisions. Maintain this DRIVER discipline and you’ll make faster, better finance calls in internships and first roles. This is a long arc; you’re on the right path. I’m excited to see where you apply these habits next — keep probing assumptions, telling the financial story, and translating models into decisions."
