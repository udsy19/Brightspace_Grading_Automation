  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applies concrete empirical tests (market model, event windows, abnormal returns, volume z-scores), and draws specific, reasoned conclusions about each form including practical frictions that prevent exploitation. This depth and applied analysis meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied a standard event‑study workflow (estimation window, market model via OLS, abnormal returns, CARs, and significance testing) across defined event windows and complemented it with volume z‑scores and interpretation. This combination of concrete methodology, calculations, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined information‑incorporation expectations, implemented appropriate event‑study methods, and provided a nuanced interpretation of how quickly and accurately markets reflected public information (showing both delays/overreactions and rapid adjustments). This combined conceptual framing, empirical testing, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and invokes key behavioral concepts (overconfidence, attention cascades/herding) and links them to empirical patterns (momentum, volume spikes), showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is high‑level and incomplete—several listed biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not explicitly discussed or applied—so the work is correct but not thorough, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, applied treatment of momentum (empirical detection and interpretation), but does not address other anomaly classes (value, size, calendar effects) or provide multiple anomaly examples. Coverage is correct and focused but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented a market‑model OLS event study but did not explicitly use or demonstrate the CAPM framework (no mention of risk‑free rate, CAPM expected return formula, or CAPM‑based abnormal returns). Under the STRICT technical standard, the submission fails to show explicit CAPM calculations, block‑level code understanding, or clear ownership of running and validating CAPM outputs, so it does not meet the criterion.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Implement: student ingested historical data and computed returns/statistics from that data.\n- Validate: student examined summary statistics and plots (t‑tests, CARs) reflecting empirical values.\n- Missing explicit Discover/Reflect action: no documented step showing cross‑checking each numerical claim against independent historical sources or an explicit discrepancies log.",
      "reasoning": "The student computed and reported numerical results derived from historical data (price peak, AR/CAR statistics), showing partial verification. However they did not explicitly document verifying \"all numerical claims\" against independent historical records or note any discrepancies—no audit/confirmation steps or discrepancy log were presented—so the requirement is only partially satisfied."

  "personalized_feedback": "Max —\n\nI’ve enjoyed watching your DRIVER transformation unfold. You’ve moved beyond ad-hoc intuition and shown a clear ability to map finance problems to technological solutions: your work tied valuation assumptions to data inputs, translated scenario outcomes into decision-relevant metrics, and used automation thoughtfully to speed repetitive analyses. Those are concrete signs of systematic thinking — you’re already structuring problems so a CFO or product leader can act on them, not just producing one-off spreadsheets.\n\nFor the next leg of the journey, focus your energy on tightening the “technical implementation” layer so your systematic designs become reliably executable in business settings. Practical next steps:\n- Turn a few of your key analyses into reproducible workflows: document inputs, transformation steps, and outputs so a non-authoritative colleague can rerun them and trust the results.\n- Embed simple validation checks and scenario sensitivity tables that map model outputs to business KPIs (cash runway, NPV ranges, break-even timelines). That makes the model useful in board or investor conversations.\n- Create short, digestible operational notes for each model — assumptions, failure modes, and what to do if data changes — so your work moves from prototype to tool.\n\nKeep treating AI as your execution assistant: use it to draft tests, generate documentation templates, or create checklist-driven workflows. You’ve adopted a professional habit of aligning tech with finance; deepening the implementation discipline will make your analyses both persuasive and operational.\n\nThis is a process, not a finish line. Maintain curiosity, iterate intentionally, and you’ll keep converting messy problems into clear decisions — a career-defining capability in finance. I’m excited to see where you take it next.\n\n— Prof. Zhang"
