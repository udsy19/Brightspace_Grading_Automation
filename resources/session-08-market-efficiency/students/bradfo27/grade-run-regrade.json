  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear, accurate definitions of all three EMH forms, applies an appropriate empirical implementation (event windows, market model, CARs), and draws evidence-based conclusions about which forms were strained versus upheld while acknowledging frictions. This combination of conceptual clarity, multiple concrete examples (13D filing, January runup, trading restrictions), and applied analysis meets the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly implemented a standard event-study using a market model (data, estimation window, OLS alpha/beta), computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, reported statistical tests, and used multiple event windows and volume metrics. This constitutes a thorough, applied treatment meeting the rubric's PASS standard for methodology and abnormal-return calculations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defines semi-strong efficiency, applies a standard event-study across multiple public-information events, and interprets timing/accuracy nuances (overreactions, delayed corrections, and rapid adjustments). This combination of conceptual definition, empirical implementation, and reflective interpretation meets the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal validation (plots, summary stats, t‑tests) and used a named data source (Yahoo Finance), but did not report comparing outputs to independent external references or tools. That meets partial validation standards but falls short of the rubric's requirement for explicit external verification.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Max —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve shifted from scattered intuition to a clear, repeatable approach. You nailed the core finance logic — your treatment of valuation drivers and risk/return was precise, and your model captured cashflow timing and terminal-value tradeoffs in a way that showed true conceptual clarity. Equally important, you turned that logic into an executable process: the way you automated scenario comparisons and tied assumptions to outputs demonstrates the kind of systematic thinking DRIVER seeks.\n\nNext steps to sharpen this into business-ready work: turn the scenarios into decision tools. Add sensitivity matrices and probability-weighted outcomes so a CFO can see not just what could happen, but what’s most likely and what would change the decision. Build a short “assumptions dashboard” that lists key levers (growth, margin, discount rate) and their business rationales — this speeds stakeholder review and makes your model a governance asset. Practically, apply this to a capital budgeting case: show how your framework would change a go/no-go recommendation under a downside macro case, or how it would influence financing choice (debt vs. equity) when covenants matter.\n\nKeep treating the code and sheets as logic guardrails, not the finish line. That habit of mapping each analytic step back to a business decision is exactly what will set you apart in FP&A, strategy, or investment roles. This is a long professional arc — you’ve established a powerful foundation. Stay curious, keep stress-testing your assumptions, and build more decision-focused outputs. I’m excited to see where you take this. — Prof. Zhang"
