  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak/semi-strong/strong forms and applies them to the GameStop case with specific supporting evidence (short interest, social media, data/split issues) and empirical checks. Their DISCOVER→IMPLEMENT→REFLECT progression shows both conceptual understanding and applied analysis, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (GameStop squeeze vs. EMH), named the DRIVER phase (\"define and discover\"), and described concrete steps (date range, data retrieval, specific checks and subsequent analysis). This clear framing and planned approach satisfy the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described a clear plan/layout for the market-efficiency analysis (sectioned workflow, date range, targeted checks, and subsequent analysis), satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The steps are concrete and actionable, allowing a reviewer to understand and reproduce the intended approach.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly collected and inspected price data and discussed market implications, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not describe or perform formal event-study methodology (estimation window, expected-return model, abnormal returns/CARs, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses accuracy of information incorporation (noting semi-strong violations) and identifies mechanisms (behavioral effects, limits to arbitrage) that slow accurate pricing. However, they do not quantitatively analyze the speed of incorporation (no timing, event-window metrics, or formal tests), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard, the student must explicitly demonstrate abnormal-return calculations or event-study methodology. The transcript shows only raw price retrieval and descriptive checks (low/high, split adjustments) and no attempted calculation or explanation of abnormal returns, estimation windows, models, or verification of results; therefore the criterion fails.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jarrett — I want to celebrate how clearly you’ve shifted from ad hoc problem-solving to the DRIVER way of thinking. In your recent work you consistently framed problems before building solutions, laid out explicit assumptions as \"logic guardrails,\" and used AI to execute repetitive steps rather than as a crutch. Those concrete habits — structured problem decomposition, explicit assumptions, and iterative verification — are exactly the systematic thinking we train for in finance.\n\nFor the next leg of your journey, focus on two practical next steps. First, sharpen a couple of financial-concept anchors in your workflow: when you build a cash-flow or valuation step, add a quick checklist (e.g., matching timing of cash flows, consistent discount rates, and tax treatment) and run a two-scenario sensitivity to surface model fragility. That connects directly to capital-allocation decisions CFOs make. Second, strengthen one part of your technical implementation that still needs attention by introducing a lightweight validation routine: small unit checks (balances reconcile, no negative working capital where impossible) and a short “assumption-to-impact” trace that shows how each input moves the main KPI. These are low-effort guards that pay off in business conversations and reduce rework.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a living discipline rather than a one-off tool. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier — it makes your analyses faster to build, easier to defend, and far more valuable to decision-makers. I’m excited to see where you take these habits next. Keep iterating; I’m here to help refine the next model you build. \n\n— Professor Zhang"
