  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and explicitly applies them to the GameStop event, supported by empirical work (CAPM alpha/beta and cumulative abnormal returns) and discussion of short interest and analyst estimates. The combination of clear definitions, application to a real case, and data-driven testing demonstrates a thorough, competent treatment of the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student created multiple relevant visualizations (price, volume, abnormal returns, CAR), executed them with code, and used those plots to draw concrete interpretations about timing and magnitude of the short squeeze. The combination of technical plotting and clear visual interpretation meets the criterion's requirement for thorough visualization of abnormal returns and cumulative effects.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly states the research question, objectives, and a concrete research design (estimation/event windows and use of CAPM), satisfying the requirement for explicit Define & Discover articulation. These elements provide a defensible study plan that a reviewer or supervisor could immediately understand and evaluate.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied core event-study elements (estimation/event windows, CAPM as the normal-return model, calculation and plotting of abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) showing practical implementation. However, treatment is basic—missing details on statistical significance, formal abnormal return formulas/tests, robustness checks, or alternative models—so it meets partial but not thorough PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the concept of information incorporation (semi-strong EMH) and implemented an event-study framework (estimation/event windows, CAPM, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) to assess whether public information was reflected in prices. However, treatment is incomplete for a PASS: there is only high-level timing language (\"instantly\", \"exact moment\") and CAR plots without formal timing/ intraday analysis, statistical significance testing, or robustness checks, so the criterion is partially but not thoroughly demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies herding (mislabelled \"hurting\") and limits to arbitrage and links them to the GameStop event using empirical results, showing conceptual understanding. However, several specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) are not discussed or developed, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Lucas —\n\nI’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently lay out your assumptions up front, walk through cash flows step-by-step, and interpret model outputs in business terms — for example, your scenario splits and the way you tied revenue assumptions to unit economics showed clear systematic thinking. Those concrete habits — naming drivers, isolating levers, and linking them to outcomes — are exactly the transformation from “monkey mind” to disciplined financial reasoning that this course aims for.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on turning that clarity into business-ready robustness. Practical next steps:\n- Add quick sanity checks (back-of-envelope checks on market size and implied margins) after every model run so outputs stay anchored to reality.\n- Expand your scenario work into a sensitivity table that highlights which inputs move NPV/IRR the most; that makes it easier to prioritize data collection or management actions.\n- Translate model results into two brief recommendations a CFO could act on (e.g., defer capex vs. accelerate go-to-market), with the specific assumptions that would trigger each choice.\n\nOn the technical side, keep refining how you document logic: one-line comments for each worksheet or function and a short “assumptions” page will accelerate peer review and real-world decision use.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that will pay off in any finance role — the ability to decompose problems, defend assumptions, and prescribe actions is rare and highly valued. Treat today’s models as prototypes: iterate, stress-test, then present the distilled decision insight. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
