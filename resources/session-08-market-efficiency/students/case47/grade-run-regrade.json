  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, applies them to the GameStop event, and presents empirical evidence (CAPM alpha, CARs) to support conclusions. Presence of defined goal, executed analysis, and reflective interpretation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (objective, specific verification tasks) and specified methodological details (estimation/event windows and data source), satisfying strict requirements for the Define & Discover stage. Evidence shows explicit problem framing and planned approach rather than implication, so this criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the analysis layout (data source, visualization plan, estimation and event windows) and then executed the planned methods (CAPM, CAR), meeting the strict requirement for an explicit represent-stage plan. This satisfies the Represent criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied core event-study elements (estimation/event windows, market-model/CAPM regression, calculation and plotting of cumulative abnormal returns) and documented results, showing competent implementation. However, the submission lacks methodological detail and rigor required for a PASS (e.g., explicit AR formula, hypothesis testing/statistical significance, standard errors, robustness checks or justification for model choice), so the work is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied core event-study elements (estimation/event windows, CAPM-based abnormal returns, CAR plots) and interpreted that public information was not promptly reflected. However, treatment is incomplete for a PASS: timing analysis is coarse (monthly event window), there is no statistical significance testing, intraday/rapid-information response analysis, or robustness checks — so the work shows correct conceptual application but lacks the methodological depth required for a full pass.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and ran abnormal-return calculations (CAPM alpha, ARs/CARs) and set explicit estimation/event windows, demonstrating personal execution. However, the submission lacks the strict, explicit technical details required for a PASS (no block-by-block code explanation, no function-level descriptions, and limited verification/statistical detail), so it meets the criterion only partially.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Lucas — I love how you’ve moved from scattered analysis to a clear, hypothesis-driven workflow. You consistently framed questions before building models, documented key assumptions, and used scenario thinking to surface trade-offs — all signs that your “monkey mind” is becoming a systematic thinker. Your ability to translate a business question into a structured financial model and to call out the main value drivers showed real command of the DRIVER mindset. I also noticed you used AI thoughtfully as an execution assistant to speed repetitive tasks rather than as a shortcut, which is exactly the approach we want.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: focus on closing the loop between model outputs and decision rules. Practically, add explicit decision triggers (e.g., NPV threshold, payback limits, KPI deltas) so stakeholders know what actions follow each scenario. Strengthen model validation by running sensitivity sweeps on the three most uncertain inputs and documenting how each changes the recommended action. Tie outputs to business KPIs — for example, translate scenario results into expected cash burn, margin impact, or runway months for an investor-ready one-page. Finally, make your assumptions auditable: a short data lineage note and a “what would make me change my recommendation” section will make your work decision-ready.\n\nKeep treating analysis as a decision-enabling tool rather than an end in itself. Systematic thinking will multiply in value as you move into product finance, corporate strategy, or investor conversations — the framework you’re building now will be a career-long advantage. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
