  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and applies an event-study (AR/CAR, regression) with statistical testing to show abnormal returns tied to public Reddit activity, supporting a violation of semi-strong EMH. Coverage is detailed, includes empirical results and interpretation, and connects theory to the GME example, meeting the rubric's requirements for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and applies event-study methodology (AR, CAR), specifies parameter estimation (alpha/beta via regression) and event windows, and conducts statistical tests with interpreted results (e.g., CAR=66% with p≈0). This is a thorough, applied treatment that meets the rubric's requirements for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly links public Reddit information to a semi-strong EMH violation, implements an event-study (event windows, regression-estimated expected returns, AR/CAR) and reports statistically significant abnormal returns at the peak, showing rapid and large market response inconsistent with fundamentals. This applied, temporally-aware treatment demonstrates thorough understanding of how markets incorporated (and mispriced) new information.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly describes the event-study methodology, references code that estimates alpha/beta and computes AR/CAR, and reports numeric results (CAR and p-values), showing an attempted calculation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly state personal execution (\"I ran...\"), provide block-by-block code explanations, or fully demonstrate ownership/stepwise implementation, so the work is only partially satisfying the explicit implementation requirements.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alex —\n\nI’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve moved from scattered intuition to a repeatable, BUSINESS-oriented thought process. You’ve shown clear mastery of core finance ideas (your explanations of valuation drivers and risk decompositions were precise and well-linked to real decisions), you used technology thoughtfully to support analysis rather than to distract, and you followed each DRIVER step so consistently that your work reads like a decision-ready memo. In particular, your ability to translate a vague business question into a defined objective, identify the key levers, and communicate the resulting implications for stakeholders demonstrates the systematic thinking we aim for.\n\nFor the next leg of this journey, focus on strengthening your technical implementation as a way to make those decisions operational in the field. Practical next steps:\n- Build one small, end-to-end model (e.g., 3‑scenario cash flow projection for a capital project) with clearly stated assumptions and a short “how to use” note for non-technical stakeholders.\n- Add simple validation checks and scenario bounds (reasonableness tests) so business owners can trust outputs without digging into the spreadsheet.\n- Turn one analysis into a decision template: inputs, logic guardrails, expected outputs, and recommended actions. That connects your DRIVER thinking directly to budgeting, forecasting, or investment committees.\n\nKeep treating AI and tools as execution partners — they accelerate iteration, but your job is the judgement layer. The systematic habits you’re building are rare and career-defining: they let you turn ambiguity into decisions that move capital and strategy. This is an ongoing craft; I’m excited to see where you apply it next."
