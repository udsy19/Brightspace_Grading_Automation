  "transcript": "Hello, this is Holden Hegby, and right now we're looking at the script that Python create for me for session eight, I believe. And this one is about a market efficiency analysis of GameStop. and this is just investigating the 2020 to 2021 short squeeze were just skyrocketed for a little bit and this is just to use efficient efficient market hypothesis we're using that to look at what happened here and so here in section one we are looking at the defining discover where we set the stage and state the price and actual price and variables the stated price what the the assignment said was four cents but the actual was four dollars and it was just from checking the historical data and showing um split adjusted low in August 2020 was around one dollar and it's actual not adjusted low was around four dollars and yeah so the professor for to find and discover I checked the historical price data for GME the assignment states a price of four cents but and in August 2020 but the lowest price I could find from that month was around four dollars or one dollar split adjusted I believe this may be a typo for mine for my analysis I will proceed using correct historical figure of four dollars and the event timeline of this is August 2020 to September 2020 and then January 2021 and late January 2021 and February 2020 so in August the price was low four to five dollars seen as a failing brick -and-mortar store and then in September the founder of chewy via 13% stake signate for signaling belief in a turnaround for the company and then in 2021 um reddit coordinates massive buying campaign and then 2021 and or late january uh price surges to an intraday high of 483 per share and then in february the price crashed everybody sold um and then congressional hearings um were there after all that mess um and then the short interest that peaked at 140 percent which is extremely high and then the key players were retail traders versus hedge hedge funds and then the market anomaly trading platforms like robin restricted buying of gme and the victim melvin capital lost 53 percent in january requiring a 2.75 billion dollar bailout which is insane and then a fundamental value most analysis analysts value the company between 10 to 40 dollars per share and we can just go and look at the output for this section i'll basically say just about the same thing um sorry i'm all the way at the bottom yeah so here the critical first step same way to verify the four cents um the actual low is four dollars and that statement was incorrect and the appropriate communication for the professor here's the professional way to address this Professor, for the Define and Discover section, I checked the historical price of GMU, the assignment states a price of four around, yeah. So we've like seen that above, let's go back. And then the case study, this is just all the given data, and then now we can go to section two. so this is the represent stage finding key theories and formulas needed for this analysis and the efficient market hypothesis this is a theory that says the stock price already reflects all available information this means it's impossible to beat the market consistently uh there are three forms or levels of emh week form which is you can't predict future prices by looking at uh past private price movements uh semi-strong form the price already includes all public information um and then strong form the price includes all public and private it, which is insider information. And then behavioral finance. This theory argues that EMH is wrong because investors are human and not always rational. People make predictable mistakes or biases driven by psychology. And some of the key biases for GameStop was hurting. Everybody on reddit was buying uh so they should too and then overconfidence we can beat the hedge funds we are smarter and then anchoring i bought at 300 i won't sell until it's back at 300 um which is just ignoring new information given and then concept three is limits to arbitrage um arbitrage is the exact or is the act of fixing the wrong price for a profit uh the smart money like hedge funds should be able to do this uh limits arbitrage are the real world reasons why this fails um so these are the limits to arbitrage uh risk the wrong price can get even wronger um before it gets better like how gme went from 100 to 400 uh when it's like just a 40 stock um and then cost it costs money to short a stock um which is you are banking on the stocks going down so and like you make money off of the stock going down um constraint a hedge fund can run out of money before the market becomes rational and then here's the formula for abnormal return this is the main tool for an event study it measures surprise returns so AR for abnormal return equals actual return minus expected return and actual return is what the stock actually did and then expected return what the stock should have done based on its risk and the second formula is the CAPM and as I calculate expected return for the abnormal return formula the expected return equals risk-free rate plus parentheses beta times market return minus risk-free rate and risk-free rate is what you can earn with zero risk um market return what the whole market returned and beta how um volatile stock is and we can go down to the output now so here's the output um the concept stating the three three types that we form semi -strong strong and then key biases hurting overconfidence anchoring and let me start arbitrage risk cost and constraint and then here's the formulas so now we can go to section 3 which is the implement state implement stage and we just use both of section 1 and section two to put them together and so i think this might just be easier to just look at the output here um let's see where are we section three yeah so analysis um market efficiency testing what the emh violated yes in spectacular fashion uh weak form was violated the entire strategy was based on momentum so like there's a bunch of people saying to buy buy buy buy and people bought because the price was going up and this is a predictable predictable pattern that worked for weeks and then a semi-strong form which was also violated this is the most important violation the public info number one gme's fundamental value was 10 to 40 dollars and the price of 483 clearly did not reflect that and then public info to the 140 140 short interest was public data this information was inefficiently priced until reddit users were weaponizing it and then a strong form which was also violated um any reddit user who knew the plan before it was public had insider info uh this form is almost always violated which is why um insider trading is legal so they all kind of um gather together to skyrocket the stock and um so yeah as you can see all three of the forms for EMH were violated in this and what this means the GME event is strong evidence against a semi -strong market efficiency and the second analysis is the behavioral finance analysis this event is a perfect case study for behavioral finance hurting so the example for hurting millions of retail investors bought at the same time driven by social media and so it's just a digital stampede and overconfidence and anchoring many investors held on for the cause anchoring to the idea of the crusade and had way too much confidence that they could force a new reality even as the price fell and then the limits to arbitrage this the most critical point uh rational investors like the hedge hedge funds knew that gme was overpriced at 100 at 200 uh so they tried to fix it by shorting but they were hit by a perfect storm of limits so the risk of that was the price kept rising which forced irrational buying and then the constraint was melvin capital ran out of money um and uh was forced to buy back shares at the peak, making the problem worse. This is a short squeeze and the smart money was bankrupted by the dumb money. Third analysis, rational investor profitability analysis. Could a rational investor have profited from this? Looking back, it's easy to say I wish I bought at $4 and sold at 483 uh but looking forward before the event buying gamestop at 40 dollars was not a rational investment to begin with it's pure gamble and you weren't betting on the company's profits you were kind of just buying it to just hold a random stock that wasn't doing anything with the company and you were just betting on social media movement uh which is speculation not systematic strategy and the conclusion of this uh no irrational fundamental investor would have seen gamestop at fifty dollars when fundamentalists said uh ten dollars and either shorted it and lost or stayed away if you shorted it you got killed and then or you stayed away the profit opportunity was only available to those participating in the irrationality and then the fourth analysis was theoretical implications emh versus behavioral this case shows that while the market is usually efficient we're using ems it is vulnerable to behavioral bubbles um like uh this case and active versus passive management a passive investor who owns an s&p 500 index fund was fine this event punished active investors like melvin capital who tried to enforce rational prices and it shows that active investing or like stock picking is very risky then off to section four here this is the verify section and this is just to check the work uh how would a real study uh verify this they would use statistics um an academic would calculate the abnormal return for from section two for every single um stock and then day or every single day in january 2021 and use it as a t-test to prove that these returns were statistically not zero they would prove it wasn't just luck and for this assignment we don't need complex stats our verification is simpler a stock with a 40 to 10 to 40 fundamental value traded at 483 this is self-evidently in abnormal return a major hedge fund melbourne capital was bankrupted uh this verifies the event was real and significant and brokerages um like robin hood had to halt trading uh this verifies the event broke the normal market plumbing yeah so robin hood had to stop all trades on gamestop like i said before and then a real study would also ask was this just a gamestop thing uh they would check if other meme stocks like amc blackberry and nokia also moved at the same time uh the fact that they did makes behavioral hurting um a huge explanation uh which is more robust and stronger and more believable i only remember amc from this whole game something but i was pretty young and so we can go back down to the section 4 just to look at the output and yeah so statistical the returns were statistically not zero and they prove it wasn't just luck so yeah basically says the same thing and then we can go to section 5 here so this is the evolved stage and we apply our insights to investment strategy to show the abnormal return calculation in action let's just go to the output here I think that'll be simpler okay so the evolved stage calculating the abnormal return for GameStop in January 2021 let's use our formula from section two to show how abnormal the gamestop return was the actual return was 1641 .9 while the expected return was seven percent that is a crazy actual return and this means gamestop's price uh went up by over about 1600 percentage points and then it's like more than its risk um which is beta and the market's return would ever predict so this is the definition of an anomaly and the evolved investment strategy what does this event teach us as investors uh for passive investors this event proves that passive investing like owning index funds is safe and you ignore all of that that's going on and then for active investors Gamestop event is a major lesson in limits to arbitrage. It teaches that being right is not the same as making money. You can be right and still go broke if a rational crowd fights you and it introduces you to new risk, which is social media risk. Now, section six. This is a reflect where you synthesize the two big ideas. and the behavioral finance so the emh theory versus behavioral gamestop does not mean the efficient markets efficient market hypothesis is wrong on most days for most stocks the market is mostly efficient semi-strong news comes out and the price adjusts quickly this is emh in action however the gamestop event is the perfect explanation that proves the rule it shows that the market is not a perfect logical machine it's a complex system run by us as stockholders and image describes the machine on a normal day behavioral finance describes what happens when the human operate operators driven by hurting greed or fear override the machine and send it off the rails and the gme case shows that financial reality is a mix of both theories markets try to be efficient but they are always at the mercy of us as investors at the mercy of our psychology which can create spectacular bubbles and crashes that image cannot predict or explain now we can go to the output here so it just says the basically same thing here and yeah thank you",
