  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission explicitly contrasts EMH forms with documented behavioral mechanisms and links those to observed market outcomes (abnormal returns, arbitrage/solvency issues), demonstrating a clear theoretical-practical synthesis. The student also draws an investment implication (passive allocation) from that synthesis, meeting the strict Reflect requirement.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student explains EMH forms and explicitly applies them to the GameStop event, cites the abnormal-return concept and CAPM, links behavioral mechanisms that violate EMH, and derives a clear practical implication (passive strategy). Coverage is conceptually thorough, uses concrete examples from the case, and connects theory to practice, satisfying the criterion for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the three EMH forms to the GameStop case and provides supporting empirical examples (e.g., 140% short interest, short squeeze), but the explanations are uneven and sometimes vague (weak-form reasoning is unclear and some wording is imprecise). This demonstrates correct conceptual understanding but not the thorough, detailed treatment required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal returns and names an expected-return model (CAPM) and data/tools (Yahoo Finance, Python), demonstrating conceptual awareness of event-study elements. However, they do not present key methodological details (estimation/event windows, model specification/calibration, cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete and earns PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses information incorporation (identifies semi-strong form failure, cites short interest and abnormal returns, and used daily data/abnormal-return concept), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide precise timing, formal tests, event-window analysis, or statistical evidence of how quickly information was reflected, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Kayla — you’ve made a noticeable shift from ad-hoc problem solving to disciplined, DRIVER-style thinking. I’ve seen you consistently identify the core financial drivers in case problems (revenues broken down by volume and price, and explicit operating margin levers), and you’ve started to construct structured decision trees rather than jumping straight to numbers. Your explanations highlighted thoughtful assumptions and you linked model outputs back to business questions — that kind of systematic mapping from question → drivers → model is exactly what turns “monkey mind” into reliable financial judgment.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact:\n- Tighten technical implementation: before finalizing a model, build quick validation checks (sanity ranges, reconciling totals to source data, and testing extreme scenarios). In practice, that prevents costly mis-forecasts when presenting cash flow projections to stakeholders.\n- Strengthen DRIVER discipline on the front end: spend more time on the Problem and Drivers steps. Explicitly document the one-sentence problem statement, list prioritized drivers, and note which drivers are proxied vs. directly observed. This habit makes your models easier to defend in budgeting or valuation meetings.\n- Connect assumptions to business outcomes: for each key assumption (e.g., churn rate, price elasticity), add a one-line commercial rationale and, where possible, a fallback plan (what the business would do if the assumption misses). That turns financial analysis into actionable recommendations for product, sales, or ops teams.\n\nKeep going — your trajectory matters more than any single deliverable. Systematic financial thinking is a career multiplier: it makes your recommendations credible, repeatable, and scalable across contexts. Treat each project as another iteration of the DRIVER loop, and you’ll steadily convert those good instincts into trusted judgment that leaders rely on. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
