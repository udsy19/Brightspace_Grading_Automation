  "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Will Borowski and today we're going to be talking about my session 8 assignment, a market efficiency investigation of the GameStop short squeeze using the DRIVER framework. Before I write any code, I'm going to follow Dr. Zang's advice and start with the D in DRIVER, which is Define and Discover. This is my debrief for the project. First, the objective. The goal is to analyze the GameStop event from 2021. I need to determine if the Efficient Market Hypothesis or EMH failed, and if it did, can behavioral finance explain what happened. Second, the scope. I'm analyzing GME stock price and volume. My time frame is August 2020 to June 2021 to capture the period before, during, and after the main squeeze. My benchmark for comparison will be the S&P 500. Third, the constraints. The main constraint I have is data. I'm using publicly available data from Yahoo Finance. I don't have access to private hedge fund data or a full feed of all Reddit comments, so my analysis is based on public price and volume. Fourth, my data inventory. I have GME and SPY historical price data. I need to verify the data in the assignment prompt itself. The assignment tells me that the analyst fundamentals were around $10 to $40 per share, which I will accept as a key piece of public information. Fifth, my success metric. Success isn't about beating the market. It's about making a clear and evidence-based conclusion. Can I identify which forms of the market were violated and which specific behavioral biases were at play? And finally, the benchmark. As I said, I'll be using the S&P 500 or the SPY. This will be my sanity check to see if the GME event was a unique, company-specific event or part of a market-wide trend. With that debrief out of the way, now we go to R, which is Represent. This is the simple logical flow that I'll follow. Step one, get the data for GME and our benchmark, the SPY. Step two, the assignment has a critical first step: Verify the claim that GME traded at 4 cents in August 2020. My first analysis will be to check this fact. Step three, I'll create my main piece of evidence, which will be Plot One. This will show GME's price versus the S&P 500, so we can see visually the moment it detached from rational market behavior. Step four, I'll create Plot Two, showing GME's price on the same chart as its trading volume. This will show if the price spike was backed by a massive increase in trading, which can show herding. And then step five, I'll use these two plots to answer the core assignment questions. Next, we go down to the I part of the DRIVER framework, which is Implement. I'm going to walk through my Python code, which follows the plan I just laid out. First, I import my libraries: yfinance for getting the data, pandas for handling it, and matplotlib for making my plots. Then I set my variables. The tickers are GME and SPY, and the start and end dates are set from August 2020 to June 2021. This line, yf.download, is what pulls data from Yahoo Finance. This next step is part of my validation. The assignment told me to check if GME traded at 4 cents, so I wrote code to find the minimum price in August of 2020. The results are in: the prompt claimed 4 cents, but the actual low price was around $4 to $5. The prompt's data was wrong. This is a critical finding; it confirms that we can't trust data unless we verify it ourselves. Next, to make Plot One, I have to normalize the data. This is a very simple trick that just sets the starting price from both GME and SPY to 100. It lets us fairly compare their performances. Here's Plot One. The blue line is essentially tracking the S&P 500, which is basically the market. It's pretty stable. The red line is GameStop. You can see it tracks the market normally and then in January of 2021, it detaches completely from reality and spikes. Now, for Plot Two. This chart has two y-axes. The red line is the GME price and the blue bars are the trading volume. This plot is just as clear. The price spiked in January. The trading volume went from almost nothing to a massive unprecedented spike. This visual confirms that the price was driven by a frenzy of trading. Next, we go to V, which is Validation. As Dr. Zang's email said, first outputs are not sacred. So, for validation, I need to do my sanity check on the results. My first validation was the most important: I checked the prompt's data point and found it was false. The 4 cent claim was wrong. This already tells me the market for information might be inefficient. My benchmark comparison, Plot One, validates my analysis. The S&P 500 did not spike. This proves the GME event was not a rational market-wide response to new economic information. It was an event specific only to GME. For a third validation, the volume plot, Plot Two, shows that the price spike and volume spike line up perfectly. This validates the theory that the event was driven by a surge of trading activity, which supports the herding hypothesis. Next, we're going to go down to E, which is Evolve. I'll run through a quick scenario. The assignment asks if a rational investor could have profited. Well, let's think about it. For Scenario One, Melvin Capital was a rational investor. They saw the public information that GME's fundamental value was $10 to $40 and they shorted the stock, betting that it would fall. But the irrational market, driven by herding, stayed irrational longer than the hedge fund could stay solvent. They were blown up. This shows the limits to arbitrage. For Scenario Two, what if a new rational investor saw the Reddit momentum and bought in? They could have made thousands, but when do they sell? At $483? Or do they hold on until it's $50? The risk was enormous. This wasn't investing based on fundamentals; it was pure speculation. So evolving the problem shows that the rational strategies on both sides were extremely high risk. The market link to fundamental value was completely broken. So finally, we're going to move on to Reflect, the final part of the DRIVER framework. What did I learn and what's the final answer? What I learned through all of this is that the GME event is a perfect example of how market efficiency can fail spectacularly. Next, did I violate the Efficient Market Hypothesis? Absolutely. It violated weak-form efficiency. The technical analysis of Reddit discussions and high short-interest data did predict a massive future price change. The past did predict the future. It violated semi-strong form efficiency. All public information, like analyst reports saying the stock was worth $10 to $40, was completely ignored. The price did not reflect all public information. And then what explains that? This is a textbook case of behavioral finance. We saw herding. The volume plot shows everyone rushing in at the same time, driven by Reddit. We saw overconfidence. Retail traders believing they could beat the hedge funds. And we saw limits of arbitrage. The rational investors couldn't fix the mispricing because the irrational side had too much momentum and capital. My final reflection is that EMH is probably a good baseline for most stocks, most of the time. But this case proves that under the right conditions, behavioral finance factors can and do take over, creating massive bubbles that are detached from the fundamental values learned from the EMH model. This concludes my DRIVER framework analysis of the GameStop event. Thank you.",
