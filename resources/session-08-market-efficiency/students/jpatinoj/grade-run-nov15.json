  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implemented an event-study framework (CAPM normal returns), estimated regression parameters, computed ARs/CARs, ran significance tests, and performed window sensitivity and rolling analyses—meeting methodological and calculation expectations. While some granular reporting (exact estimation window lengths and full test statistics) is brief, the execution and interpretation are sufficiently thorough for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tested how quickly markets incorporated information using a CAPM-based event study, significance tests, window sensitivity, and a 10-day rolling CAR that shows multi-day drift, which supports a conclusion of slow/partial incorporation. While some granular reporting is brief, the methodological execution and interpretation are sufficiently thorough for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student produced multiple visualizations (AR chart, CAR plot, price chart, 10‑day rolling CAR) and interpreted them quantitatively (timing of spikes, CAR magnitude, multi-day drift, window sensitivity), which demonstrates thorough visualization and interpretation of abnormal returns and cumulative effects. This meets the PASS standard under moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly designed and executed an event-study (IMPLEMENT) and explicitly tested/interpreted semi-strong efficiency (REFLECT), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not discuss or compare weak and strong forms of EMH nor provide comprehensive theoretical coverage across all forms, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly invoked behavioral explanations (explicitly mentions overconfidence and implied herding) and incorporated proxies in analysis, showing conceptual linkage between behavior and observed returns. However, treatment is shallow and omits several named biases (anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) and detailed discussion of mechanisms, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented an event-study and identified multi-day drift consistent with a momentum anomaly, showing methodological competence. However, they did not address value, size, or calendar anomalies, so coverage is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Javier —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve begun to think like a finance professional using the DRIVER framework. You consistently break complex problems into the DRIVER stages, isolate key drivers (revenue per unit, churn, margins) and trace how a change in one variable propagates through the model. That systematic decomposition — making assumptions explicit and building logic guardrails around them — is a concrete strength I saw in your work. You also show growing confidence in mapping model outputs back to business questions, which is exactly the shift from “monkey mind” intuition to structured reasoning we aim for.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening three practical areas so your models have even more business impact:\n- Financial concepts accuracy: when you convert assumptions into cash-flow impacts, add a quick reconciliation step—map model line items to standard financial statements (revenue → top line, working capital → cash flow). This makes it easier for stakeholders to trust and act on your analysis.\n- Technical implementation: continue using logic guardrails, but add simple validation rules (e.g., nonnegative cash, bounds on growth rates) and one sensitivity table per model. These are low-effort checks that catch unrealistic results before they reach decision-makers.\n- Communication: practice writing a one-paragraph executive summary and a single-slide “so what” for each analysis. Lead with the business implication, then show the top two drivers and a recommended action. That clarity will make your work persuasive to managers.\n\nYou’re on a genuine trajectory. Systematic thinking is a career multiplier: it makes you faster, reduces rework, and turns analysis into decisions. Keep iterating—every model you build is another step from competent to trusted advisor. I’m excited to see where you take this. —Prof. Zhang"
