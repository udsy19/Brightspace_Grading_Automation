  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implemented an event-study (CAPM) with regression output, computed ARs/CARs, tested statistical significance, and ran sensitivity checks—demonstrating competent methodological application and interpretation. Coverage includes implementation details, robustness checks, and reflection, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied an event‑study methodology, produced regression results and significance tests, and used window and rolling‑CAR analyses to assess speed of information incorporation, directly addressing the criterion. Robustness checks and the interpretation of multi‑day drift support a thorough, evidence‑based conclusion that markets did not instantly incorporate the new information.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, verified data and key events, and outlined the methodological approach and scope—meeting the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover articulation. Evidence shows both problem definition and planned analysis, so this criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study (CAPM) to test semi-strong efficiency and reported statistically significant abnormal returns, showing conceptual and empirical understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, treatment is narrowly focused on the semi-strong form without thorough definitions, comparisons to weak/strong forms, or multiple detailed examples required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal return calculations, ran regressions, computed ARs/CARs, and reported statistical tests and robustness checks (Implement + Validate). However, under the STRICT technical requirement they did not provide explicit code, block‑by‑block explanation, or detailed verification steps demonstrating ownership and reproducibility, so the work is only partially demonstrated.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student calculated and reported abnormal returns, ran robustness checks, and proposed plausible explanations linking ARs to market frictions and behavioral forces. However the explanation is high-level and lacks deeper quantitative attribution (e.g., effect sizes or formal controls/results), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Javier — I want to start by celebrating how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. In your recent project you defined the finance question crisply, laid out the key drivers (revenue per customer, churn, CAC) and translated those drivers into testable hypotheses. Your experiment design and the way you documented assumptions showed a real shift from “random tinkering” to disciplined decomposition — that’s the heart of turning a monkey mind into a systematic thinker.\n\nFor next steps, focus on two concrete areas where small, consistent improvements will have outsized business impact. First, technical implementation: you’ve begun to show progress in structuring code and reproducible outputs — push that further by packaging repeated calculations into modular functions, adding simple checks or assertions, and versioning a single canonical notebook so non-technical stakeholders can rerun forecasts without ambiguity. Second, integration of finance and technology: link your model outputs directly to decision levers executives care about. For example, convert scenario outputs into projected quarterly cash flows, break-even timelines, or incremental ROI per marketing channel. Build a sensitivity table that ties driver changes to NPV and a short set of “if/then” recommendations for product or sales teams.\n\nKeep treating code as a guardrail and AI as an assistant — use them to scale your thinking, not to replace it. The disciplined approach you’re building will pay off in any finance role: forecasting, capital allocation, or strategic planning. This is a journey — every model, even the imperfect ones, refines your intuition and makes your recommendations more defensible. I’m excited to see how you translate these next steps into sharper business decisions. Keep going — you’re developing a professional superpower."
