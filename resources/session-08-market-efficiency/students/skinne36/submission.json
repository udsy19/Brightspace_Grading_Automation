  "transcript": "Hi, how's it going? I'm Sandy Skinner, and this was my session eight market efficiency and behavioral finance assignment. So we want to investigate the market efficiency and sort of analyze this whole situation with GameStop in the short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021. So the first thing I sort of wanted to understand was what exactly was this? And so I went to Gemini and I sort of asked it to analyze what happened with GameStop in 2020. and we found out that essentially a large group of individual retail investors drove up the price of GameStop at an unprecedented rate. So GameStop was considered a failing business as their brick and mortar of selling physical video games was being replaced by digital downloads. So a ton of hedge funds actually, most notably Melvin Capital, which lost 53%, as we saw in the earlier thing, began to short sell the stock. um and however a few users on r slash wall street bets uh argued the company was undervalued and as um thousands of retail investors saw that they began to buy which meant the stock began to climb and the hedge funds saw this price pricing price rising and started losing millions stopped the bleeding they were forced to cover their shorts so they had to buy gamestop shares which created the cycle of buying and buying and buying and buying which drove the price up extremely rapidly and at this point robin hood and several other brokers did something that sparked massive outrage they halted the buy button for gamestop and gamestop and other quote-unquote meme stocks because it was causing unprecedented changes in the market now moving on to the actual assignment uh the first step was to verify the statement And GameStop traded at $0.04 in August 2020. So what I did here is I went into Yahoo Finance and I went to August 2020 down here. And we can see that the lowest it was trading at was around $1.10 and was steady climbing up at that point too. Specifically after in September, what's his name? Ryan Cohen acquired a 13% stake. So this price was actually up a lot, which could also sort of lead to, I mean, it was steadily rising this entire time. So we can see why a lot of people wanted to sell it as it would cause potentially it to be overvalued. So I went into CoLab here and I typed in all the information about it, all the cash flows to try and understand this market efficiency analysis. Whether rational investors could have profited systematically, efficient market hypothesis predictions to observe behavior, and behavioral finance explanations for these observed anomalies. So the first step was this market efficiency analysis, which provided a compelling case for examining the EMH. So a weak form EMH, prices reflect all past trading, semi-strong form EMH, prices reflect all publicly available information, and strong form, prices reflect all public and private information. So this is a significant challenge to the semi-strong form EMH because it reflects all publicly available information, as the massive price surge goes far beyond what would be justified for this fundamental publicly available information of $10 to $40 per share, and it was heavily influenced by publicly available information shared and amplified on social media platforms like Reddit, which led to this coordinated buying activity and the stock to go up exponentially. Additionally, information was incorporated rapidly, but not always rationally. The high short interest of 140% was publicly available and became a central piece of the narrative on platforms like Reddit. This led to more coordinated buying activity. which was driven by online communication and acted as a form of information or a catalyst. And the price reaching $483,000 suggests that the information being incorporated was heavily influenced by speculation, sentiment, and the mechanics of the squeeze itself, rather by solely the intrinsic value of GameStop's business, which would be part of the semi -strong image. So we can see that there are many other factors that influence rather than just the image. It did, in fact, generate abnormally massive returns. and there's some potential predictability for those who understood the market microstructure of high short interest and low float. However, even if you know that there can be a short, it's very hard to time it and understand when it's going to go up and when it's going to go back down, so it's a little irrational for people to have gotten exactly that timing right as there was nothing that fully said when that GameStop price was just going to shoot up exponentially. Now moving on to the behavioral finance analysis, which explores the impact of psychological factors, biases, and heuristics on financial decision-making and market outcomes. Hurting behavior was certainly prevalent. A ton of people bought, and it just led to more people keep buying and keep buying, which created a snowball effect and people to just again keep buying and the stock to go up exponentially additionally this is what the confirmation bias as the stock continued to rise and the fact that people kept buying kept confirming their beliefs the gambler fallacy which led some people to believe the upward trend would continue indefinitely and on the other side that a reversal was quote-unquote due which could have led to bad decisions such as selling early right before it went up to that $483 mark or buying late before it went way back down or when it went up to that $483 not selling because they thought it could go up even more. There's no way to really know. Social media platforms are definitely central to this hurting behavior. Information sharing was widely shared and discussed, and this was sort of coordinated as well on the open discussion forum. I mean, there's no way to fully say it, but the shared sentiment led to a de facto coordination of buying activity and emotional contagion as well. The excitement, enthusiasm, and sense of community on these platforms are committed to emotional decision -making and reinforced the willingness to take on very high risk. The game stop-squeeze certainly highlighted significant limits to arbitrage, which is a strategy of profiting from price differences in different markets or from a mispricing relative to fundamental value. They would typically short an overvalued stock like GameStop to profit when the price eventually corrected. However, in this case, there was so much risk involved, and when it squeezed, they had to buy back those shares at even higher prices to cover their positions, so it's very, very high losses. Now, moving on to rational investor profitability. vulnerability um while the short high short interest was a known vulnerability the trigger and magnitude of the squeeze were driven by factors that are super difficult for rational models to predict or systematically exploit because you never know how humans are going to react even if you think you have an idea of it um shorting game stop was certainly a rational strategy based on intrinsic value but there was significant risk due to that squeeze mechanics So when it goes up to that 423, even when you're short, there's so much money that it's up that you have to cover your position, and that can lead to losing money even if it is to go back down in the future. For analysis of those risk-adjusted returns, people who bought early when it was fundamentally undervalued, they probably got very high returns, and if they sold another peak additionally, the risk-adjusted returns were astronomical. However, if they bought during the squeeze, GameStop carried an immense risk. There was no way to know if it was going to go back down, and if people bought up when it was $400 and weren't able to sell when it was up to $483, they could have lost unlimited amount of money. This was public information. However, not everybody has read it, and not everyone was able to understand this, as it's a very specific app so a lot of people weren't aware of it and having that information certainly would have been important. Now moving on to theoretical implications the GameStop event served as a real world stress test for the EMH as we saw that public information is not always everything as social media sentiment and high short interest can be incorporated into prices in ways that significantly misprice stocks and lead to extremely high volatility, which the traditional EMH does not account for. However, it does align very well with the principles of behavioral finance. If you were able to understand how people would react to everything, you certainly may have been able to profit and say, okay, people are going to buy now, people are going to sell now. If you were able to understand that, you could have sold when it was at that super high $400 price and bought when it started going up a little bit because you knew people were going to keep going up. For active management and implication of it, this would be supported by the fact that traders who successfully navigated the volatility achieve significant abnormal returns, which suggests opportunities exist to outperform the market if you look for it. However, passive management for long-term passive investors is certainly also supported by this as there was so much risk taken on in that that a lot of people probably lost money as well. And by just avoiding that altogether, you could have avoided losing a heck ton of money in this whole situation. And so either way, you would have had to be a very good active manager and also gotten lucky and understood when to sell and when to buy. Now the efficiency policy implications, market transparency, questions were certainly raised about the transparency of short interest data and retail trading volume, policies that enhance the visibility of these factors could be considered, and this is sort of an example of market manipulation. while distinguishing between genuine sentiment and manipulative behavior on social media is challenging. This event certainly sparked discussions about the potential for coordinated action to manipulate markets and whether existing regulations are sufficient. We know that Robinhood actually stopped the buy button, which was sort of against this, and probably saved some money in the long run, but was also considered to be somewhat unethical and not allowed, and so it was hard for people to understand what was really the right thing to do there.
