  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes and executes the CAPM-based abnormal return pipeline (data retrieval, pre-event regression, AR and CAR computation) and reports numeric regression results, demonstrating block-by-block understanding and personal execution. This satisfies the strict technical-implementation requirements for the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the research question, hypotheses (EMH forms), data requirements, benchmark, event window, and stepwise analysis plan (pre-event regression → AR → CAR → interpretation), meeting the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration. The plan is sufficiently detailed for a reviewer to understand the testing problem and research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines a clear, reproducible framework for analyzing efficiency around events—identifying data, benchmark, model (CAPM), metrics (AR/CAR), visualization, and event mapping—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is sufficiently detailed for a reviewer to understand and follow the intended analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms and applies an event-study approach (IMPLEMENT) to test them, demonstrating conceptual awareness. However, the explanations are superficial and contain logical errors (e.g., misinterpreting what a violation of weak-form efficiency would imply) and do not rigorously justify the claims for each form; therefore the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework (market-model/CAPM regression, ARs, CARs) and produced concrete regression outputs, showing procedural competence. However the treatment lacks depth on key methodological details and robustness (statistical significance testing, explicit window choices, return definitions, handling of splits/outsliers), so the approach is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied an event-study framework and linked abnormal returns and volume spikes to discrete events, demonstrating conceptual ability to test information incorporation. However, the analysis lacks methodological rigor on timing and accuracy of information reflection (no intra-event timing, significance testing, confounder controls, or explicit event-window choices), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Fabian — I want to start by celebrating how you’ve embraced the DRIVER way of thinking. Your technical implementation was crisp: you translated a financial question into a repeatable process, used AI as an execution ally, and kept a clear logical guardrail so the outputs were reproducible. Those concrete choices — structuring inputs, validating outputs, and building a stepwise workflow — show you’ve moved from ad‑hoc tinkering to systematic problem solving. That shift is the core of the DRIVER transformation.\n\nNow for next steps you can take to deepen impact in real business settings. A few focused actions will close the remaining gaps:\n\n- Tighten financial concept links: when you present model outputs, tie them explicitly to core finance primitives (cash flows, discount rates, terminal value). Practice by reworking one project’s assumptions into an explicit NPV ladder — show how each assumption moves enterprise value.\n- Translate tech into business decisions: run sensitivity and scenario analyses on key drivers (price, volume, cost of capital). Convert those results into actionable recommendations (e.g., which levers to prioritize for margin expansion or working capital improvement).\n- Improve stakeholder narratives: for each model, produce a one‑page executive summary that states the business question, key assumptions, downside/upside scenarios, and recommended decisions. Use simple charts and a short “so what” conclusion.\n\nKeep treating models as decision tools, not just outputs. Your systematic thinking is exactly what employers and managers need: it makes messy business problems tractable. Stay curious, iterate on real cases, and let DRIVER guide you from good answers to great business judgment. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
