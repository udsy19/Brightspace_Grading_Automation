  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms, implements an event-study/CAPM approach to compute abnormal returns, and uses those empirical results plus behavioral explanation to argue violations. The treatment is applied, specific (regression alpha/beta, extreme abnormal returns), and comprehensive enough to meet PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a full event-study workflow: data acquisition, pre-event regression to estimate expected returns, calculation of abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, and interpretation with concrete regression outputs and event examples. This applied, specific treatment meets the threshold for PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student executed an event-study workflow and calculated abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns tied to event dates, using regression estimates and volume/time alignment to assess market reaction. This applied analysis with event examples and interpretation demonstrates a thorough, practice-oriented treatment of information incorporation consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations, described the event-study workflow, and reported concrete regression results, which shows partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, provide block-by-block explanations, or explicitly assert ownership/verification of outputs, so the evidence falls short of a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student attempted validation by sourcing data from Yahoo Finance and reporting regression results and visual alignment with event dates, showing some external-aware checks. However, they did not explicitly compare outputs to additional independent external references or document specific data/code integrity checks, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than a full PASS.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly names the three EMH forms and applies empirical results (abnormal returns/event alignment) to assess them, demonstrating conceptual understanding and application. However the treatment is relatively brief and contains an imprecise description of the strong form (\"we can't beat the market\"), so coverage lacks the depth and accuracy required for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Fabian — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from ad‑hoc answers to a clear, repeatable DRIVER approach. You consistently apply the right financial concepts (your treatment of cash flows, risk adjustments, and valuation drivers was spot on), and you’ve begun to weave technology into analysis in a way that supports decision-making rather than obscuring it. I also noticed you internalized the DRIVER steps: you frame the decision, identify relevant drivers, and structure sensitivity checks before leaping to conclusions. That systematic posture is exactly what separates reactive problem solvers from reliable finance practitioners.\n\nNext steps to sharpen your impact: translate that Driver thinking into robust execution practices that a finance team can trust. Concretely, make your assumptions explicit in a single “assumption sheet” for every model, produce a short sensitivity matrix (best/base/worst) that ties drivers to business outcomes, and run at least one scenario analysis (e.g., demand shock, cost inflation) showing P&L, cash, and covenant effects. When you prepare deliverables, accompany them with a one‑page executive summary that highlights the decision hinge — the handful of drivers that move the outcome most. These steps are small but high‑leverage in real business settings (board memos, investor diligence, or capital allocation debates).\n\nKeep treating models as decision tools, not final products. The DRIVER habit you’re building—define, run, interpret, validate—will scale with your career whether you’re in FP&A, treasury, or corporate development. This is a journey: expect iterative refinement, and celebrate when a stakeholder trusts your next recommendation because your logic guardrails made the tradeoffs visible. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
