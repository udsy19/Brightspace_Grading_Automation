  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research problem, verified and corrected key data, specified event and estimation windows, and stated a testable null hypothesis—meeting strict requirements for Define & Discover. These concrete, documented choices make the research design clear and defensible.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly specified a coherent event-study framework—model choice (CAPM), estimation period, expected-return and abnormal-return calculations, cumulative metrics, and a formal statistical test—providing a clear, defensible method for analyzing efficiency around the GME event. These concrete, documented methodological choices meet the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, structured event-study workflow: problem framing, model specification (CAPM), estimation, abnormal-return and cumulative calculations, hypothesis testing, and visualization. While some advanced robustness details are absent, the implementation shows a systematic, organized execution of the planned methodology consistent with the DRIVER Implement requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and attempts to test EMH forms (primarily weak and semi-strong) and carries out empirical analysis (Implement) with a clear problem setup (Discover) and interpretation (Reflect). However, the treatment is not thorough or fully precise: tests focus on abnormal returns/event-study methods without distinct, complete tests or discussion for weak vs. semi-strong vs. strong definitions and implications (e.g., serial-correlation tests for weak form, explicit semi-strong information tests, or discussion of insider information for strong form). Thus the work shows correct understanding but is incomplete in depth and coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented the core event-study steps (market model/CAPM, AR, CAR, and hypothesis testing) and presented results and visuals, showing practical application. However, treatment lacks depth and robustness (incomplete detail on event-window choices, econometric adjustments, diagnostics, and some inconsistent reported numbers), so the methodology is correct but not thoroughly or rigorously executed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-study tools (expected returns, AR, CAR, hypothesis testing) and framed the event, so they demonstrate a basic, correct approach to measuring information incorporation. However, the treatment lacks depth on timing and accuracy—no explicit intraday or high-frequency analysis, limited discussion of event-window choice and how quickly prices adjusted to specific pieces of information—so the work is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jackson —\n\nI want to highlight how clearly you’ve moved from reactive problem-solving to a more deliberate, stepwise approach — the heart of the DRIVER transformation. In your recent work I saw a much stronger habit of decomposing problems: you identify objectives, enumerate assumptions, and trace the cash-logic through your models. That systematic scaffolding made your financial narratives easier to follow and allowed you to surface key tradeoffs quickly. Your written explanations have become more focused and business-oriented, which is exactly the communication skill banks and CFO teams need.\n\nNext steps to stretch that progress into real-world impact:\n- Tighten one remaining financial-concepts gap by mapping model outputs directly to business metrics (e.g., translate projected cash flows into coverage ratios or free cash flow yield). Practically, run sensitivity tables that show how a 1–3% sales change affects EBITDA, debt service, and covenant headroom.\n- Address the technical gap by converting one of your manual calculations into a reproducible logic block (pseudo-code or a small function). Treat the code as a “logic guardrail” for reviewers — it should be readable and tied to the assumptions table so analysts can audit results quickly.\n- Strengthen DRIVER compliance by adding an explicit “decision trigger” at the end of each analysis: what action should management take if X occurs? That links analysis to governance and makes your work operationally useful.\n\nKeep going — the shift to systematic thinking you’re forming will pay off every time you walk into a planning meeting or build a business case. This is a journey; every model you rework and every assumption you justify sharpens your career advantage. I’m excited to see where you take it next."
