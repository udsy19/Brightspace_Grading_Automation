  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (scope, event timeline, required analyses) and specified the estimation window and null hypothesis, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration. This provides a clear, defendable setup for the subsequent DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly articulated a concrete plan for analyzing market efficiency: specified the market-model approach (CAPM), estimation window, formulas (expected return, AR, CAR), and subsequent statistical test and visualizations. This explicit mapping from objectives to methods satisfies the strict requirement for a clear Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, organized workflow from problem definition through model specification to execution and validation: they retrieved data, computed log returns, estimated CAPM parameters, produced abnormal returns and cumulative ARs, ran a t-test, and created visuals. Multiple concrete outputs and stated methods show systematic implementation consistent with the Represent plan, satisfying the criterion for Implement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests weak-form efficiency using an event-study approach (CAPM, ARs, CARs, t-test) and offers behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage explanations, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: semi-strong and strong forms are asserted rather than rigorously tested or defined (no explicit semi-strong announcement tests or discussion of insider-information implications), and some phrasing is unclear, so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements core event-study components (CAPM market model, AR/CAR calculations, t-test) and specifies estimation/event windows, showing solid conceptual execution. However the treatment lacks depth and robustness (e.g., details on event-window length, inference adjustments, cross-checks, clarity on reported CAR magnitude and units), so it is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied appropriate event-study tools (AR/CAR, CAPM, t-test) that are directly relevant to assessing how markets incorporate information, and they provided interpretation tying persistence of ARs to behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage factors. However, treatment is incomplete: timing of incorporation (e.g., intraday vs. multi-day, explicit event-window analysis), semi-strong tests around specific announcements, and robustness details are missing, so the work demonstrates correct but not thorough analysis.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jackson —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly you’ve moved from scattershot ideas to a disciplined DRIVER approach. In your recent assignments you consistently decomposed complex problems into crisp sub-problems, stated testable hypotheses, and documented assumptions so a third party could reproduce your logic — exactly the kind of “logic guardrails” that tame the monkey mind. Your use of iterative checks (sanity checks and simple back-of-envelope validations) shows you’re thinking like a financial analyst who cares about robustness, not just outputs.\n\nFor your next steps, treat the areas where you’re making progress as concrete practice fields:\n- Financial concepts: anchor your models to business decisions. When you compute margins, show what a 200 bps swing means for EBITDA and cash flow and how that would change credit covenants or investment timing. Translate ratios into decisions CFOs make.\n- Technical implementation & integration: move from single-run outputs to structured sensitivity and scenario analyses. Build 2–3 “what-if” scenarios (base/optimistic/stress) and summarize their business implications in one slide or paragraph.\n- Communication: tighten your executive story. Start with the decision question, state the result in one sentence, then show the key numbers that support it. Use annotated tables or a one-line takeaway per chart so stakeholders don’t have to hunt for the answer.\n\nKeep leaning on AI as an execution assistant — let it run permutations or help draft your executive summary while you own the financial judgment.\n\nThis is a long game. Your disciplined approach is the most valuable asset you’re building; it will let you make high-quality, defensible decisions under pressure. Stay curious, keep iterating, and treat each model as a rehearsal for the next real business decision.\n\nWarmly,\nProfessor Zhang"
