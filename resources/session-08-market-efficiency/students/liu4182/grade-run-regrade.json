  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined the EMH-form question, implemented an appropriate event-study methodology, reported empirical results (CARs, momentum, decoupling, no insider evidence), and ran robustness checks. Their discussion links observed patterns to the theoretical distinctions among weak, semi-strong, and strong forms, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly designed and implemented an event-study framework (estimation window, CAPM expected returns, AR/CAR, t-tests), produced concrete CAR results, and performed multiple robustness checks. These elements together demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology and abnormal return calculation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student designed and executed an appropriate event-study (estimation window, CAPM normal returns, AR/CAR, t-tests), reported specific CAR magnitudes and timing (e.g., 22% over ten days with initial underreaction), and interpreted results against weak/semi-strong benchmarks with robustness checks. This constitutes a thorough, applied treatment of how quickly and accurately markets incorporated new information.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly designed and reported abnormal-return calculations and presented numeric CAR results and robustness checks, showing attempt and some execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code blocks, statements of having run specific scripts, or block-by-block explanations demonstrating personal execution and ownership—so the work is correct and implemented but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly identifies and applies EMH forms to the GME events and links methodology to those tests, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the explanation is concise and applied rather than deeply pedagogical (limited formal definitions or multiple illustrative examples), so it shows solid but not thorough mastery.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Jiayu —\n\nI want to celebrate how clearly your thinking has shifted over the term. You consistently framed valuation and risk problems the DRIVER way: you define the decision, isolate drivers, run structured evidence checks, iterate assumptions, and explain results. In your assignments you separated cash-flow drivers from terminal-value assumptions, used sensitivity checks to show which inputs matter most, and leaned on simple, transparent logic to justify discount-rate choices. That clarity — breaking big finance questions into bite-sized, testable parts — is exactly the transformation from “monkey mind” reactions to repeatable, defensible analysis.\n\nFor the next steps, focus your energy on tightening the technical implementation layer so your finance logic is operational in real business settings. Practical actions:\n- Turn one of your valuation spreadsheets into a repeatable notebook (clear cell-by-cell assumptions and an inputs section) so analysts can update scenarios quickly.\n- Add automated checks: sanity tests for negative cash flows where they shouldn’t occur, and threshold warnings when sensitivities exceed materiality targets.\n- Build a short scenario template (base / upside / downside) linked to key drivers so management can see impact on EBITDA and free cash flow in under 5 minutes.\nThese aren’t about programming prowess — they’re about creating guardrails that make your models usable in budgeting, M&A diligence, and investor conversations.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as your core career skill. The way you isolate drivers and stress-test assumptions will set you apart in finance roles where clear decisions matter under uncertainty. This is an ongoing craft; I’m excited to see the practical frameworks and templates you’ll produce next. I’m here to help map those into concrete tools when you’re ready."
