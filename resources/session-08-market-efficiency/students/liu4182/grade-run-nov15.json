You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines and distinguishes weak, semi-strong, and strong-form predictions, implements a targeted event-study/CAPM testing framework, reports significant CARs consistent with weak and semi-strong violations, and performs robustness checks before concluding—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission presents a clear, correctly specified event-study methodology (estimation window, CAPM normal returns, AR/CAR, significance testing), implements it in code with concrete parameter choices and empirical CARs, and runs robustness checks—constituting a thorough, practitioner-level treatment that satisfies PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly designs and implements an event-study test of information incorporation (estimation windows, CAPM normal returns, AR/CAR, significance), reports concrete empirical timing outcomes across multiple events (underreaction, immediate shocks, delayed herding), and interprets these results with robustness checks—demonstrating a thorough, practitioner-level treatment that satisfies PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a rigorous, quantitative treatment of momentum (autocorrelation, CARs, robustness), but the submission does not address value effects, size effects, or calendar anomalies. Because momentum is well-covered but other anomaly classes are missing, the criterion is partially satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student specifies a correct CAPM-based abnormal return procedure, reports estimated betas and CARs, and notes robustness checks—evidence of partial technical execution. However, the submission lacks the strict required explicit demonstration (no code excerpts, no block-by-block explanation, and no clear \"I ran/verified\" ownership narrative), so it does not meet the PASS standard for this strict technical criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student computes and reports abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns with quantitative results and robustness checks, showing substantive analysis. However, there is no explicit evidence of graphical visualization (plots or figures) of AR/CAR over event windows, so the visualization criterion is only partially satisfied.",

You’ve moved from ad-hoc reasoning to consistently breaking problems into drivers, framing clear hypotheses, and tracing how assumptions flow to financial outcomes. In your recent assignments you showed especially strong conceptual clarity: your cash-flow logic was coherent, your scenario framing captured the key business levers, and your explanations tied model outputs back to real decisions. That systematic habit—naming drivers, isolating uncertainty, and laying out consequences—will serve you far beyond this course.\n\nFor your next steps, focus on tightening the technical implementation so your thinking is fully and reliably expressed. Practical actions:\n- Build a simple spreadsheet for one case you’ve already worked (forecast, sensitivity table, one-page dashboard). Make each driver a labeled input so assumptions are transparent.\n- Create 3 targeted sensitivity runs (best case, base, downside) and annotate how each alters key decisions (e.g., capacity expansion, financing choice, pricing).\n- Add brief “logic checks” next to outputs: signs, growth rates, and cash-burn timelines. If a result looks counterintuitive, trace which driver caused it.\n- Practice translating model results into business recommendations: what would you advise a CFO, and what further evidence would you request?\n\nKeep treating the code/worksheet as a logic guardrail and use AI as an assistant to automate repetitive steps—not to replace the judgment you’ve developed. This is a journey: these disciplined habits make you the kind of systematic thinker companies need when stakes rise. I’m excited to see how you apply this approach to budgeting, capital allocation, or M&A analysis next—keep pushing those guardrails tighter and narrating the logic behind every choice."
