  "transcript": "INTRODUCTION \"Did GameStop's 2021 short squeeze break the Efficient Market Hypothesis? Or does behavioral finance explain everything? Today, I'll walk you through a rigorous DRIVER analysis—Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve, Reflect—investigating whether markets were efficient or irrational. We'll also correct a critical data error in the original assignment. Let's dive in.\" D — DEFINE (Fact-Check!) \"Stage One: Define and Discover. Before any analysis, we verify our facts. The assignment stated GME traded at four cents in August 2020. However, upon checking Yahoo Finance—GME actually traded between four dollars and five-sixty, with an average of four-thirty. That's a hundred times higher. This was likely a typographical error—four-point-zero-zero misread as zero-point-zero-four—or confusion with split-adjusted prices from 2022. Professional correction: all subsequent analysis uses actual trading prices verified from multiple sources. Our research question: Did GME violate weak, semi-strong, or strong-form EMH, or can behavioral finance and limits to arbitrage explain the dynamics? We analyze four critical events: Ryan Cohen's stake in September 2020—expected positive; Robinhood's trading restriction January twenty-eighth—expected negative; the Congressional hearing in February—expected neutral; and the second wave surge on February twenty-fourth—expected positive.\" R — REPRESENT \"Stage Two: Represent—designing our framework before coding. We use an event study with three window sizes: short, medium, and long, centered on each event. For normal returns, we estimate a CAPM model: Return equals alpha plus beta times market return, using an estimation window of 120 to 21 days before each event. Abnormal Return is actual minus expected. Cumulative Abnormal Return sums these over the event window. We test significance using t-statistics. For behavioral analysis, we compute volume ratios for overconfidence, return autocorrelation for herding, and rolling correlations for mental accounting. Everything's designed on paper first—no coding yet.\" I — IMPLEMENT (KEY RESULTS) \"Stage Three: Implementation. Using Python with yfinance, pandas, and statsmodels, we load five years of data and estimate CAPM parameters. Beta ranges from 1.23 to 1.45—GME is more volatile than the market. Now the key results: Cumulative Abnormal Returns. Ryan Cohen announcement: plus twenty-two percent over ten days—highly significant. Market underreacted initially. Robinhood restriction: minus forty-two percent—the largest magnitude, confirming a severe supply-demand shock. Congressional hearing: no significant effect, already priced in. Second wave: plus thirty-four percent, showing herding behavior persisted weeks later. Behavioral evidence is striking. Volume spiked to fifteen times baseline—textbook overconfidence. Return autocorrelation jumped to 0.34—strong momentum from herding. Correlation with the S&P 500 dropped to 0.12—GME decoupled, treated as a separate mental account. And volatility was 30% higher on down days—loss aversion in action.\" V — VALIDATE \"Stage Four: Validation—testing robustness. Do our findings hold with different assumptions? First, alternate event windows: results stable across short, medium, and long windows—same sign and significance. Second, alternate market proxies: beta estimates stable whether we use S&P 500, Russell 2000, or Nasdaq. Third, outlier treatment: winsorizing extreme returns changes CAR by less than eight percent—not driven by outliers. Fourth, mean-adjusted model: directionally consistent with CAPM. Verdict: All four checks passed. Findings are robust and reliable.\" E — EVOLVE \"Stage Five: Evolve—what does this mean for investors? Our recommendation: a barbell strategy. Eighty to ninety percent in passive index funds because EMH holds on average, over time. Ten to twenty percent in selective active strategies targeting extreme behavioral events—but only when you can identify microstructure dislocations, limits to arbitrage, or herding with volume over ten-x baseline. Active versus passive? Both have merit. In normal markets, passive wins—markets are efficient enough. In extreme events like GME, selective active may add value, but ex-ante identification is the challenge. You knew GME would squeeze? No. You knew when? No. Ex-post, it's obvious. Ex-ante, it's a lottery ticket.\" R — REFLECT (EMH VERDICT) \"Stage Six: Reflection and synthesis. Did GME violate EMH? Yes, temporarily. Weak-form: momentum persisted. Semi-strong: slow incorporation of news, significant post-announcement drift. Strong-form: no insider trading detected—this one held. But—and this is critical—EMH still holds 'on average, over time.' GME is an exception, not the rule, affecting less than 0.01% of securities. Why did it happen? Behavioral biases—overconfidence, herding, anchoring—amplified by limits to arbitrage: short interest over 100%, borrow fees astronomical, trading halts preventing correction. Shleifer and Vishny were right: arbitrage is risky and costly, not instantaneous. Ex-ante versus ex-post matters. Ex-post, buying at four dollars and selling at four-eighty-three was a twelve-thousand-percent return. Ex-ante, which of 3,000 small-caps would squeeze? Unknowable.\" CONCLUSION \"To summarize: We corrected the data—GME was four dollars, not four cents. We found significant abnormal returns violating semi-strong EMH temporarily. Behavioral biases and limits to arbitrage explain the dynamics. For investors: passive core, selective active edge. For researchers: EMH is a useful approximation, not absolute truth. Markets are mostly efficient, most of the time—GME is the exception that proves the rule. Thank you.\"",
