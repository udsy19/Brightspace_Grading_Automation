  "transcript": "Good evening. So today we're just going to be looking at a stock. We're going to be examining a moment where the bedrock of the financial theory, the efficient market hypothesis, was tested like it has not been tested before. And that is going to be through GameStop, which had a short squeeze in 2021 and it was the perfect case study. So using the driver framework, we're going to systematically break down what happened and most importantly what it means for the future of finance. So step one was just a critical fact check of if the price was actually at 4 cents and it was proven incorrect that in August of 2020 it was between $4 and 650 likely at around 550. So our process is going to be to define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, reflect. We're going to be going through the driver framework. So the first step is to define and discover and it's about framing the problem and verifying and stating facts. So the core problem is did GameStop's price movement violate market efficiency. So crucially we started by verifying the core claim is that they traded at 4 cents in August of 2020 and that was proven that it was false. They did not. This inaccuracy highlights the importance of using verifiable data. So our communication approach is to document the corrected figure and proceed with the accurate data. So the key timeline would be in August of 2020, GameStop was struggling near bankruptcy. In September of 2020, um the Chewy founder acquired the 13% stake of fundamental news event. And then in January of 2021, the event window massive Reddit driven price surge. So then we are on to represent. The represent stage is setting the analytical plan. So to test this, we must use the event study method based on the capital asset pricing model. So this allows us to separate normal expected returns from abnormal unexpected returns. Um, think of it as like checking your car's fuel economy. We're going to use the estimation window to calculate the normal mileage. So, this gives the alpha and the beta. And we look at the window from January of 2021 to February of 2021 to see how far off the normal mileage is from when you drove up a steep mountain. So, that difference is the abnormal return. The estimation window is yeah August 2020 to January 1st of 2021 to establish the normal behavior and the market proxies the S&P 500. The goal would just be to calculate the cumulative abnormal return across the impact. And then slide three is going to be our implement. And so this is where we were able to actually put um we were able to put all of this into Google Collab using Google Gemini to generate code for us. So the implement stage is where we run this regression into the pre-event data and it gave us the two critical parameters. And so these are just the parameters down below. And the low beta suggests that before the squeeze it was a lowrisk stock. um it returns moved less than the general market and it was a boring stock. Essentially, it was uncorrelated to the S&P 500. But the pre-event alpha was a negative alpha that includes that GameStop had a small and sign statistically significant negative drift in the stock price daily. Even after accounting for the market movement, it was slowly losing value. So this models the benchmark for rational pricing. Anything above is just an abnormal return. So then going on to the validate stage. This is the scale. So the validation stage compares the prediction to the reality and the results are very staggering. So the abnormal returns exploded. The peak was plus 2,000%. And yeah, this means that validation also included a volume analysis. Trading volume peaked 10 times its average and its short interest hit unprecedented 140% of the float. So these physical trading disruptions confirmed the theoretical breach of rational pricing. And then now we are on to the coding results. And so these just show the coding results and proving this to be true through the validation. It shows the pre-event beta, the cumulative abnormal return directly through coding in collab. It is in the evolve stage that we translate our findings into the actionable strategies. So this is where we're actually like using our data. Um the shift from passive to active is so GameStop's event argues a purely passive investment strategy like buying an index fund how it failed to capitalize on or even hedge against such extremes outliers. So it shows that ma massive process were just able to take active risks and information asymmetry is that the profits were largely generated by a specific group retail investors using social media and this suggests that the information advantage came not from fundamental analysis but from coordinating market action which EMH assumes way. And then the investment takeaway is that the event validates behavioral finance strategy. Uh monitor social sentiment and market microructure risks like short investment. And here's more of just the rationale behind this and more of just what I said using Google Gemini and Google Collab. The the R is where we reflect. So the final stage is synthesizes all of our findings and addresses all of our core concepts which these are actually the core concepts down below. Market efficiency testing, efficient market hypothesis, information incorporation, market anomalies, behavior biases, asset substitution problem, limits to arbitrage and EMH implications. So the price surge was caused by public past short interest data and current social media information. But the market massively underreacted to the downside risk and overreacted to the short squeeze potential. So this is a clear failure of the EMH forms. So regarding the information incorporation is information was not instantly but explosively driven by collective behavior and social media coverage. So prices reflected sentiment and short interest dynamics but not fundamental analyst estimates from like the $10 to $40 range. So, Harding found on Reddit and anchoring believing the stock must reach $1,000 and confirmation bias ignoring fundamental warnings drove the buying frenzy. So, for the market anomalies, the event is an entirely an anomaly. The sustained coordinated buying action created a momentum effect completely divorced from traditional finance metrics. So, limits to arbitrage is the key enabler. Rational investors like hedge funds normally correct mispricings. They couldn't have been here because of the risk that Melvin's capital short position ballooning and funding risk need bailout. So arbitrage becomes too risky allowing the mispricing to persist. So for asset substitution problem, Melvin Capitals extreme loss exposure created an incentive to take the excessive risk of holding on to losing position for too long because they needed a massive return to just survive. And then the EMH implications are the behavioral finance and how that's essential. So this confirms that while markets may be mostly efficient, they're susceptible to periods of collective irrational behavior, especially when micro structure factors such as short interest and retail platforms are involved. We need to integrate the behavioral models to understand the modern markets. So in summary, the GME short squeeze was not a simple market movement. It was a perfect storm where technical and market structure collided with overwhelming social mediadriven sentiment. So it's demonstrated that the semi- strong form of EMH is fragile when arbitrage is limited and that fundamental value be can be entirely overridden by the coordinated behaviors. Thank you.",
