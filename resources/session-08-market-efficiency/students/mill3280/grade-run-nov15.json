  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the research question, documented factual verification, and laid out a concrete event‑study research design (benchmark, windows, metrics), satisfying the Define & Discover requirement. They also showed the DRIVER flow and connected planned analysis to validation, so the presentation meets the strict expectation for an explicit research design.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, explicit framework for analyzing efficiency around the event: choice of CAPM benchmark, specified estimation and event windows, market proxy, and the intended abnormal‑return metric (CAAR), and links this plan to regression implementation. This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit, defendable Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow from design (event‑study/CAPM) to implementation (regressions in Colab) and produced multiple outputs (alpha/beta, CAAR, volume and short‑interest metrics) used for validation and interpretation. This demonstrates organized, methodical execution of the event‑study methodology, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies EMH concepts to the GME case (event study, abnormal returns, info incorporation, limits to arbitrage) and explicitly critiques the semi-strong form. However, treatment is incomplete: they do not clearly define or analyze the weak and strong forms nor provide comprehensive, distinct discussion of all three EMH forms, so the coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and applied event-study methodology (estimation/impact windows, CAPM benchmark, abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns) and implemented it in code, with validation showing extreme CAAR. However, the treatment lacks thorough quantitative detail (specific coefficient estimates, statistical significance tests, robustness checks), so the work is conceptually sound but not sufficiently comprehensive for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies concepts for testing information incorporation (timeline, event-study, CAPM benchmark, CAAR, volume/short-interest) and concludes markets did not instantaneously incorporate information. However, the treatment lacks detailed timing analysis, statistical tests of immediate versus delayed incorporation, intra-day or robustness checks, and deeper quantitative evidence of speed—so the work is conceptually sound but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Brianna — I’m really pleased with how you’ve embraced the DRIVER framework. You’ve moved from ad-hoc problem solving to a clear, repeatable approach: your problem definition is sharp, your choice of variables maps cleanly to business drivers, and your explanations walk a reader through the logic rather than leaving them to guess. In class discussions your ability to translate a business scenario into an analytical plan (and to justify which assumptions matter) shows the kind of systematic thinking that separates reactive responders from strategic finance practitioners.\n\nFor your next steps, focus on tightening one area of technical implementation: translating your financial logic into a robust, auditable output that a CFO or FP&A team can rely on. Concretely, practice (1) documenting each modeling assumption with a one-line business rationale, (2) building a reconciliation table that links inputs to key outputs (revenues, margins, cash flow), and (3) creating simple sensitivity checks for the two variables that most change the decision. Apply this to a real business case — for example, evaluate a pricing change for a product line or a capital investment decision — and produce a short memo that explains the conclusion in plain language plus the three supporting tables. This will make your work immediately actionable in an FP&A or corporate development setting.\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a lifelong tool. The habit of structuring ambiguity into repeatable steps will be one of your most valuable assets in finance: it scales across roles, industries, and fast-moving decisions. I’m excited to see how you build on this foundation — you’re well on the way to becoming the kind of systematic thinker teams seek out when stakes are high."
