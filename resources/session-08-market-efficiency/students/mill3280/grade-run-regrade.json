  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly describes and applies an event-study framework (model choice, estimation and event windows, implementation and coding) and reports concrete outputs (pre-event alpha/beta, CAR). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS under moderate standards, though some statistical detail (test statistics/robustness) could deepen rigor.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly explains what an abnormal return is, specifies the event-study design (model, windows, market proxy), reports implementation outputs (pre-event alpha/beta, CAR) and contextualizes results with market-microstructure evidence. Coverage is applied, specific, and ties technical computation to financial interpretation, meeting the threshold for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the core problem, outlines the DRIVER stages starting with \"define and discover,\" and documents initial fact verification—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover demonstration. This clear framing and planned workflow justify a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies and interprets the semi-strong form in the GME context, uses an event study to support claims, and connects limits to arbitrage and behavioral drivers to EMH breakdown — showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for the criterion because weak and strong forms are not explicitly defined or contrasted in depth; coverage is focused primarily on the semi-strong case.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies an event-study to assess information incorporation and provides qualitative interpretation supported by CAR and market-microstructure indicators. However, the treatment lacks quantitative detail on the timing/pace of incorporation (no explicit intra-window timing metrics, statistical timing tests, or robustness checks), so the coverage is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports abnormal-return outputs and an event-study plan, they attribute code generation to Google Gemini and do not demonstrate having run, inspected, or explained the code themselves. Under the strict technical implementation standard requiring explicit execution and block-level understanding, this evidence is insufficient.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Brianna — I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve shifted from quick, ad-hoc thinking to a measured, repeatable approach. You consistently weave finance and technology together: your use of data-driven assumptions when valuing cash flows and your clear mapping from business drivers to model inputs showed real clarity. I also noticed you reliably used the DRIVER steps—defining the decision, identifying relevant inputs, and rigorously running scenarios—which is exactly the systematic thinking we aim to cultivate.\n\nFor the next stretch, focus on two concrete areas that will multiply your impact in real business settings. First, deepen accuracy in a couple of core financial concepts you’ve been practicing. Pick one valuation aspect you touched on (for example, working capital dynamics or terminal value assumptions). Create a short checklist you apply every time: economic rationale, source of the assumption, sensitivity range, and real-world benchmark (industry reports or company filings). Practically, that will make your models more defensible in investor or CFO conversations. Second, tighten the technical implementation where it tripped you up—target the single module that needed work rather than rewriting everything. Produce one robust unit (e.g., a cash flow template with built-in sanity checks and automated flags for outliers). Treat it as a reusable business tool you’d hand to a finance manager.\n\nKeep treating AI and code as execution partners rather than ends: have them enforce logic and free you to reason about trade-offs. This path—cultivating disciplined, business-grounded models—will set you apart in corporate finance or strategy roles. You’ve made tangible progress; stay curious, iterate, and view each model as practice for higher-stakes decisions. I’m excited to see where your systematic thinking takes you next."
