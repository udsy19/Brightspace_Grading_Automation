  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines all three EMH forms and applies them concretely to the GameStop event using data, abnormal-return/CAR analysis, and volume/statistical checks (Implement), then reflects on which forms are challenged (Reflect). Coverage is specific, uses multiple supporting analyses, and demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes event-study components (pre-event baseline, event window), computes abnormal returns and CAR, and references statistical testing (t-test, significance) and volume checks, showing applied methodology rather than only theory. Combined with DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) this constitutes a thorough, practical treatment matching a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied event-study methodology (pre-event baseline, event window, AR/CAR, t-tests, volume) to assess how quickly and accurately information was reflected in prices, and used those results to argue semi-strong efficiency was challenged. The work moves from question (Discover) through concrete implementation to reflective interpretation, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations, defined the event window, and described computed metrics (AR, CAR, t-tests) and validation steps, showing execution and verification. However they did not provide block-by-block code explanations or detailed function-level ownership required by the STRICT rubric, so the work is correct and implemented but lacks the explicit, low-level technical demonstration needed for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly describes performing validation (\"cross-check with external sources\") and shows data-printing checks, indicating some verification. However they did not name or compare against specific external sources/tools as required for a full PASS, so the evidence supports a PARTIAL score.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Alex —\n\nI’m really pleased with how your work has shifted from reactive problem-solving to a clear, repeatable approach. Your financial reasoning is precise — your use of discounted cash flow logic, scenario breakpoints, and trade-off framing showed you understand not just formulas but the business intuition behind them. I also noticed how naturally you paired that intuition with technology: you used data linkage and automated scenario generation to surface insights faster, which is exactly the DRIVER spirit of using tools as execution assistants rather than ends in themselves. Your write-ups have been crisp and structured, showing the same logic chain I’d expect in a boardroom recommendation.\n\nFor next steps, focus on tightening the “technical implementation” guardrails so your analyses are effortless for others to reproduce and stress-test in real decisions. Practical moves: standardize a reusable model template (clearly labeled inputs, assumptions, and outputs), add simple validation checks that flag inconsistent inputs or implausible results, and document the decision logic so a busy CFO or analyst can run sensitivity tests without re-deriving steps. In business terms, this makes your valuation work, budget models, and capital-allocation recommendations faster to vet and easier to incorporate into monthly FP&A cycles or M&A diligence.\n\nKeep treating systematic thinking as your core product. That habit — breaking problems into defined steps, representing trade-offs, and communicating the logic — will scale across roles from corporate strategy to investor relations. This is a long arc, and you’re on a strong trajectory: keep building those guardrails and your analyses will become the trusted playbook others rely on. I’m excited to see where you take this next. — Prof. Zhang"
