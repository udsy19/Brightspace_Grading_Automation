  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly framed the market-efficiency testing problem, selected a case study, and listed concrete analysis tasks (verification, form testing, profitability, comparisons), satisfying strict requirements for Define & Discover. The presentation is clear and actionable, so it meets PASS standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out a coherent plan: objectives to verify data and test EMH, a chosen event date, data sourcing, and stepwise analytic methods (estimation window, expected returns, AR/CAR). This clear, actionable layout satisfies the strict Represent requirement for an explicit plan.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, repeatable implementation workflow (data sourcing, defined event window, estimation window, calculation of expected returns and AR/CAR, and visualization), demonstrating systematic execution of the analysis. While some methodological details (model choice, statistical tests) are omitted, the implemented sequence and produced outputs meet the criterion for a PASS under the moderate DRIVER Implement standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests the semi-strong form using an event-study and connects results to behavioral explanations (Define + Implement + Evolve). However treatment is incomplete: weak and strong forms are not discussed or compared, and the discussion lacks the depth and multiple examples required for a PASS. Hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates the correct basic event-study workflow (data sourcing, estimation window, expected vs. actual returns, CAR) (Implement + Discover). However important methodological details and rigor are missing (specific model for expected returns, market/index used, statistical testing, handling of confounding events), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames information incorporation (semi-strong EMH) and applies an event-study to measure market response, showing conceptual understanding and some implementation. However the analysis lacks critical methodological detail (expected-return model, market/index used, statistical tests, precise timing of information arrival and intraday response) and thus is incomplete for a full PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tanish — I’m really pleased with how you’ve adopted the DRIVER mindset. You’ve moved from ad hoc answers to a predictable process: you clearly decompose problems into driver-level pieces, you form testable hypotheses before modelling, and your scenario work shows you think in ranges rather than single-point guesses. In particular I noticed your disciplined structure when you isolated revenue drivers (volume, price, mix) and then traced their impact through margin mechanics — that’s the kind of systematic thinking CFOs rely on in real decisions.\n\nNow for next steps to sharpen impact in business settings. First, tighten financial-concept accuracy by anchoring assumptions to market or historical benchmarks every time you set a growth or discount rate — for example, map your revenue CAGR to market TAM growth and justify WACC components with comparable firms. Second, deepen the integration between model outputs and business choices: add an actionable decision rule (e.g., go/no-go, capex trigger) to each scenario so stakeholders can act immediately. Third, improve communication by writing a one-paragraph executive summary for each model run that states the decision question, key assumptions, the headline result, and the top two sensitivities. Practically: before sharing, run two sanity checks (back-of-envelope and a comparable-company cross-check) and add a short “assumptions log” tab to every workbook.\n\nYou’ve already turned your “monkey mind” into a reliable analyst’s workflow — that’s a career-grade transformation. Keep treating DRIVER as a living checklist: with each project you’ll make faster, more defensible business recommendations. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
