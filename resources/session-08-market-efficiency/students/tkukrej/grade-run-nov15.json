  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem, research objectives, and planned procedures (data verification, event-study tests, EMH form testing), demonstrating clear research design and alignment with DRIVER's Define & Discover stages. The plan is specific enough to be defensible (explicit verification step and analytic goals), meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic event‑study workflow—data verification, selection of event date and 300‑day estimation window, computation of abnormal returns and CAR, and visualization of results—demonstrating methodological execution. While some technical details (model specification, significance testing) are not shown, the implemented, organized workflow and produced outputs meet the criterion for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external validation by naming and using Yahoo Finance to check and correct historical price claims, satisfying the moderate Validate requirement. While formal statistical significance tests/robustness checks were not reported, the rubric accepts external validation as sufficient for a pass in this context.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests the semi-strong form of EMH using an event-study methodology and interprets abnormal returns, showing conceptual understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, treatment is incomplete: weak- and strong-form implications are not addressed and the discussion lacks multiple examples or deeper comparative analysis required for a thorough (PASS) demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied use of event-study concepts (estimation window, abnormal/CAR calculations) and implemented them in code (Implement stage), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is incomplete—key methodological details are missing (model for expected returns, benchmark/index, statistical significance tests, event-window justification and robustness checks)—so it meets a basic but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the event-study concept and links results to the semi-strong EMH (showing conceptual understanding and implementation). However, the analysis lacks depth on information-incorporation specifics (timing/velocity of price responses, event-window selection, statistical significance, multiple information events and robustness), so it meets a basic but incomplete standard.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Tanish — I want to celebrate how you’ve shifted from scattered ideas to a disciplined DRIVER approach. Your work shows clear progress: your models now have consistent structure, you state assumptions up front, and your scenario outputs are easier to trace to decisions. I noticed you already link model results to practical questions (e.g., scenario-driven cash needs and sensitivity to key drivers), which is exactly the kind of systematic thinking—breaking problems into drivers, risks, and mitigations—that separates reactive work from strategic finance.\n\nNext steps (concrete, business-focused):\n- Financial concept alignment: there’s one remaining conceptual area to tighten. Re-run that part of the model with a short checklist: 1) confirm the accounting identity (flows = opening balance + inflows − outflows), 2) test edge cases (zero revenue, max expense), and 3) document why your chosen treatment maps to the business decision (pricing, capex timing, funding). This will help when you present to managers who care about why a number changed, not just that it did.\n- Technical guardrails that serve finance: add simple validation rows and one-page “sanity” charts (e.g., cash runway, margin waterfall). These aren’t about clever code — they’re logic checks that make the model credible in boardroom use.\n- Integration into decisions: translate a key model outcome into an explicit trigger (e.g., “if cash < X, delay project Y”). That makes your model an operational tool, not just analysis.\n\nKeep going — this is a journey. The DRIVER habits you’re building (explicit drivers, repeatable checks, decision-focused outputs) will compound over your career: faster, clearer recommendations and fewer surprises. I’m proud of the trajectory; keep iterating, test assumptions against business reality, and you’ll keep transforming complexity into confident decisions."
