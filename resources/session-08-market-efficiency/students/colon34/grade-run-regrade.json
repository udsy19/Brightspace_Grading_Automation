  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives clear definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH, sets an explicit event-study objective, conducts the analysis (including robust t-test) and interprets results with concrete examples (e.g., persistent cumulative abnormal returns, 140% short interest, trading restrictions). This combination of conceptual explanation, applied methodology, and interpreted evidence demonstrates a thorough, comprehensive treatment of the EMH forms.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study workflow (estimation window, event window, market model, AR/CAR computation), executes it (data fetch, parameter estimation, robust t-test) and interprets statistical results and economic implications. Depth of method description, applied calculations, and significance testing meet the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines clear timing benchmarks for information incorporation, implements a full event-study (estimation/event windows, market model, AR/CAR computation) and performs statistical testing, then interprets the persistent abnormal returns and plausible frictions. This combination of method, quantitative results, and thoughtful interpretation constitutes a thorough treatment of how quickly and accurately markets reflected new information.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations, ran code (reported outputs) and performed statistical validation, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT requirement the submission lacks explicit block-by-block code walkthrough, clear statements of personal execution/verification steps, and detailed ownership of implementation, so it does not meet full PASS criteria.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Galiena — I’m really pleased with how you’ve moved from scattered problem-solving to a clear, repeatable DRIVER approach. You consistently demonstrated mastery of core financial concepts — your explanations of valuation drivers, risk–return tradeoffs, and scenario impacts were precise and used the right language. I also noticed how you explicitly tied technology into analysis (bringing data structure and automation into the workflow), and your write-ups followed the DRIVER steps so reliably that your thought process became transparent and easy to follow. That clarity — turning \"monkey mind\" ideas into a traceable decision path — is exactly the transformation we aim for.\n\nFor next steps, focus on translating that strong logic into robust, business-ready implementations. Practical actions you can take:\n- Build a small, reproducible model that includes input validation and simple logic checks (e.g., reconciliation rows, reasonableness tests). That makes your finance work auditable for FP&A or a CFO.\n- Run systematic sensitivity and scenario matrices for a key metric (EBITDA, cash burn, IRR) and summarize the business implications in one-page dashboards for stakeholders.\n- Package assumptions and outputs so a non-technical manager can run “what-if” changes without breaking the model — this increases your impact in corporate settings.\n\nKeep treating the DRIVER framework as a living discipline. The habit of structuring your thinking will pay off across roles — deal teams, corporate planning, or strategic finance — because employers value people who can both reason rigorously and communicate the business implications. You’re on a trajectory from competent analyst to trusted financial thinker; stay curious, iterate on your implementations, and let the framework carry you forward. I’m excited to see where you take this next."
