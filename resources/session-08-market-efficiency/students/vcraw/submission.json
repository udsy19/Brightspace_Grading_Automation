  "transcript": "All right. Hello. Um, it's Vincent Crawl. This is a session 8 assignment and this the comprehensive investigation into GameStop uh the short squeeze of 2020 and 2021 and we're going to be using the driver framework uh to test the core assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis or EMH. Our objective is to determine which forms of market efficiency were violated and evaluate the robustness of behavioral finance as explanatory framework for this significant market anomaly. So first we're going to be looking at the assignment and doing the defined stage. Um, this establishes our core research question is how did a struggling retailer GameStop fundamentally valued between 10 and $40 per share achieve an astonishing peak price of nearly $483. Um, it's just a massive disconnect. Um, and it's forming the basis for our investigation. Uh, the discover phase. Uh so we need to see all the key facts in the prompt given of the assignment and that gives us our critical fact check result. Uh this assignment uh claimed GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 and the historical data verification confirmed that this is incorrect. What did I do? All right. Um the accurate data um the historical closing price for GameStop at the end of August 2020 was $6.68 approximately. Um this is a significant error because it needed to be documented correctly and it is grounded in inaccurate uh pre-event figures. Um, so this is how we set our analytical parameters of GameStop being as the stock and the S&P 500 as the market benchmark in the event window spanning from January 1st to February 28th, 2021. So then um we see that well today we're going to be employing the market model. Um it's pretty much a simplified capital asset pricing model approach to establish the stock's normal return expectation. So this uh market model is expected return equals the alpha which is the interception of the regression line plus the beta or basically the slope that measures the asset systematic risk and that's you multiply that by the return of the market. Um so pretty much uh abnormal returns are any deviation from the expected return that constitutes the abnormal return. Uh the sum of these abnormal returns over the window is the cumulative abnormal return or the C. Uh you'll see that in code. uh the time windows we used uh for the period of August 2020 to December 2020 for the model estim estimation and January to February 2021 as the event window for testing. So our hypothesis is um a violation of weak form uh em EMH due to a predictive nature of extreme short interest and the semi- strong form EMH due to the price disconnect from public fund fundamental value. All right. Um now we're going to look at our code. All right. So, I already ran the code. Just click it again. Okay. So, there's our critical fact verification. We already went through that. And here we go on to implement stage. So, we executed the market model using the MAC coefficients reflected of GameStop's performance for this execut ex executable demonstration. Uh the estimation phase yielded the following expected behaviors before the event. So the MAC al alpha the daily intercept is 0.005. Uh this is a slight positive drift not explained by the market. And then the MAC beta uh that's the market sensitivity is 1.15. Um that just basically indicates that GameStop is slightly more v volatile than the market because it's uh above one. So then you see our simulation of the event window demonstrated um extreme results specifically calculated as the abnormal returns and aggregated um cumulative a uh abnormal returns. So you see that um for the different times um let's see uh final cumulative abnormal return of approximately 350% uh during the two-month window. This performance was synchronized with a peak daily trading volume of 178 million shares representing a factor of over 100 um 100% increase from the average pre-event volume of 1.5 million shares. All right. Now we'll go on to the validation part of the driver framework. So this interprets the empirical evidence against the um EMH. The violation is the weak form. The potential to profit from the publicly known 140 or% short interest. Um this is a past data indic indicator that suggests a failure of the weak form. um EMH uh the predictable squeeze mechanism generated the 350% uh cumulative abnormal return um which is a semi- strong form and then the extreme price peak of $483 massively exceeding the 10 to 40 uh analyst consensus is a definite failure of the semi- strong form uh prices clearly failed to rationally incorporate public fundamental information. So this is the uh violation of the strong form uh the trading restriction imposed by brokers like Robin Hood suggested unequal access to market execution which is structural violation of the core principles of strong form efficiency. All right. And then we will evolve. Um pretty much uh we look at rational investor uh profitability. Um while there are massive profits uh that were achieved uh the trade was based on betting irrational behavior biases uh such as like the hurting effect um successfully navigating market micro structure issues such as trading halts. Um the profitability was not risk adjusted or systematic in the traditional sense but it relied on identifying limits to arbitrage. Um the event exposed critical gaps in the market fairness, accelerating regulatory discussions on short selling, transparency and the systematic risk posed by the inter interconnectedness of hedge funds and retail trading platforms. Um and then for active managers, the GameStop validates the search for special situations but highlights the extreme tail risk associated with volatility trading. And then a reflection um from my analysis is that GameStop represents a definitive failure of the strict interpretation of the strict interpretation of the efficient market hypothesis. um across all three of the forms. Um the sustained price deviation was too large to and too disconnected from fundamental value. Um the GameStop squeeze is a textbook example of behavioral finance in action. Uh the key drivers included are the hering and information cascade. Um the coordinated retail trading via social platforms uh trades motiv motivated by anti-wall street sentiment rather than pure profit. And then in conclusion um the GameStop short squeeze event demonstrates that the markets are complex. The anomaly is best understood as a rational market mechanic. Um, this short squeeze amplified to an irrational extent by coordinated behavioral finance biases. Um, yeah, this event pretty much proves that while markets may um be efficient over the long-term, short-term inefficiency drive driven by emotion and retail coordination can have a massive systematic impact uh over the market. And that is all I have for session 8. Thank you for listening.",
