  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission systematically treats all three EMH forms with specific tests, examples, and empirical procedures (weak-form price-pattern tests and AR/CAR calculations; semi-strong timing vs. public news; strong-form discussion of insider/regulatory profit and empirical limits). It also includes concrete event dates, measured abnormal returns, validation steps, and suggested model improvements, reflecting a thorough, well-rounded understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study workflow (formula, model choice, data inputs, event windows, example beta/CAR values) and describes planned statistical validation and model refinements. This is a thorough, methodologically sound treatment consistent with PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, methodical plan to measure how quickly/accurately new public information was incorporated (semi-strong tests, event windows, AR/CAR, t-tests) and reports concrete event dates and results while discussing validation and limitations. Coverage is specific, applied to the GME timeline, and includes proposed robustness checks, meeting the threshold for a thorough, PASS-level treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes the correct methodology and reports computed figures, but they explicitly attribute code generation to Gemini and never state that they executed, tested, or debugged the code themselves nor provide block-by-block explanations or ownership of results. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit personal execution and demonstrated understanding, the submission fails to meet the criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Anushka — your shift from reactive problem-solving to disciplined, repeatable thinking is obvious and worth celebrating. You consistently anchor analyses in correct financial principles (your treatment of time value and cash-flow logic was precise), you tied technology choices directly to business needs (choosing automation where it reduced manual reconciliation), and you followed the DRIVER steps cleanly from Define through Reflect. Your written explanations made complex trade-offs understandable for non-technical stakeholders — that clarity is a rare and valuable asset.\n\nFor the next phase of growth, focus on translating that strong conceptual work into rigid, auditable model structure — think of it as building a logic guardrail for real business decisions. Next steps:\n- Convert one of your recent analyses into a single, traceable workbook or notebook that documents assumptions, formula logic, and a one-page executive checklist (this is what a CFO will want).\n- Add simple validation routines: balance checks, extreme-value stress tests, and a “sanity” summary that flags when outputs violate basic financial identities.\n- Run a scenario-sensitivity table (best/worst/most-likely) tied to a specific business decision — pricing, capex, or working capital — and write two short memos: one on upside actions, one on downside mitigations.\n\nThese are practical, high-impact habits that link your DRIVER discipline to decisions that move a company’s bottom line. Keep seeing modeling not as coding but as a persistent decision artifact you hand to leaders. You’re building a mindset that will compound across roles and years — stay curious, iterate often, and treat every model as both a solution and a lesson. I’m excited to watch where this systematic thinking takes you next."
