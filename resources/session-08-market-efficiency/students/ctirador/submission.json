  "transcript": "For this session assignment, uh we are to investigate market efficiency using the GameStop short squeeze event of 2020 to 2021 as a case study. Verify the accuracy of stated facts, analyze price behavior relative to efficient market hypothesis predictions, and evaluate whether market anomalies constitute evidence against market efficiency or can be explained within exist existing frameworks. So before we get into the critical first step, let's look at the event timeline. August 2020, GM near bankruptcy levels. September 2020, uh Ryan Cohen acquires 13% stake. January 2021, Reddit r/wall street bets driven price surge to $483. February 2021, congressional hearings on market manipulation. Uh and then present postevent price stabilization. Key data points short interest peaked at 140% afloat. Retail trading volume increased 10fold during squeeze. Trading restrictions implemented a peak. Hedge fund Melvin Capital sustained 53% uh loss requiring bail bailout. An analyst fundamental value estimates $10 to $40 per share. So let's look at the first critical first step. So it is uh the critical first step is to verify the statement GameStop traded at 4 cents in August 2020 against actual historical data. If incorrect document accurate figures and determine appropriate communication approach for correcting the professor. So, uh, what I would do is I would say after looking at the data in Yahoo Finance, I've come to the conclusion that Gamestock stock was priced at $167 in August 2020. So, if we look at Yahoo Finance and then look for August 2020, we can see it it closed at $167. So after doing that critical step uh so to investigate the GameStop short squeeze as a case study to test the efficient market hypothesis. I will analyze price behavior against EMH predictions, evaluate behavioral finance explanations and assess whether the event created systematic profitable opportunities for rational investors. So the three main questions I'm going to be answering are which firm of market efficiency was violated? What behavioral biases and market micro structure issues best explain anomaly? Did this event create a repeatable profit opportunity for rational investors? So let's go to the represent stage. In the implement stage, I will be using the S&P 500 as a benchmark to compare the data from GameStop. In order to do this, I will be getting the data from S&P 500 and GameStop from January 1st to February 1st, 2022. So, we we'll be using the abnormal return calculation to find the abnormal return. And let's look at the definitions of or what it means for each market efficiency. So, for a weak market efficiency, prices reflect all past price and volume information. For semi-trong prices reflect all publicly available information and strong prices reflect all information including private information. So in the implement stage I asked Gemini to give me a way to visualize the data in using the cumulative abnormal return. So this is what it gave me. Uh we can look at the the code here. So it defined the tickers in Windows. It used uh GameStop and S&P 500. A normal period before the squeeze. Uh we will use the full year 2020 to calculate alpha and beta. So from January 1st, 2020 to uh December 31st. the 10day period around trading halt. Um so as stated earlier is uh 2021 January 28th and then calculate the daily returns and then run regression to find alpha and beta calculate abnormal returns in the window and finally plot the final results. So if we look at the graph here um we see that it starts from January January 21st and then it goes up to February 3rd. Uh as we can see um from January 1st uh to January 27th uh it grew drastically. Uh this means that the market was inefficient and symbolized the hurting and the market structure failing. Uh this is not due to new information about the company's value. That is something important to note. The drop off on January 28th is due to brokers restricting buying. This provides evidence of the form of market efficiency that was violated being semi- strong when the negative information the restriction became public. The price reacted instantly. As we can see here on January 28th, uh there's a dash line and on from January 27th to January 28th it lost uh like 08. So I also asked Gemini to give me a way to look at the risk. So uh here see define the time periods calculate the volatility uh and then print the results. So if we look at the data here we have the normal daily volatility uh in 2020 7.46% 46% and then during the squeeze daily volatility is 41.89%. So analysis the volatility risk during the squeeze was 5.6 times higher than normal. This demonstrates the extremely high risk for the stock in January. Uh the risk during the squeeze was 5.6 times higher than the risk in 2020. This explains why Melvin Capital sustained a 53% loss. The volatility was also increasing daily, which means that this investment wasn't a repeatable one instead of one-time event. And to look at the drop off um from the stock, uh I see it says Gamestock stock uh closes down more than 40% after brokers place restrictions on trades. We can see it says GameStop closed at $193.60 60 cents per share down 44.3% from Wednesday's Wednesday's closing price closing closing price. So it looks like the data looks about right from this graph here. Okay. So to evolve um I wanted to look at active versus passive investors and how they were affected. So passive investors uh were mainly unaffected uh because those who are passive investors invest in index funds like the S&P 500 and don't generally try to beat the market while active investors attempt to identify and capitalize on market inefficiencies. So since this was a inefficient market in GameStop uh they would be more interested in the GameStop stock. uh some investors were rewarded while others like Melvin Capital would suffer significant losses. As stated earlier, they sustained a 50 53% loss and required a bailout. So what did this event demonstrate? It demonstrated that inefficiencies are very unpredictable and rarely provide consistent opportunities for existing returns. Melbourne Capital was one of those uh that was unable to predict the the inefficient market and lost a lot. So to reflect in this event, we able to see that the form of market efficiency that was violated was a semi- strong efficient market. The market biases that explained the anomaly were the hurting and the limits to arbitrage. It proves that inefficient markets are not easily or safely exploitable. That is all. Thank you.",
