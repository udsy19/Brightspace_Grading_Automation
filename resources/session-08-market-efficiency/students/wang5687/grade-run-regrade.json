  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the testing problem, provides a formal definition of market efficiency, lists targeted research questions and a clear, ordered methodology for investigation. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage and demonstrates readiness to proceed with the DRIVER workflow.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, stepwise analysis plan (verify data, clean, mark events, estimate normal returns, compute abnormal returns, analyze) and specifies data source and timeline, meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage. The plan is actionable and sufficiently detailed for a reviewer to understand the intended methodology.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, stepwise workflow from data verification through cleaning, modeling, plotting, and statistical testing, and reports results (charts and t-tests). That demonstrates systematic implementation of the planned Python analysis, meeting the criterion for methodological execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms, applies an event-study to the GME case, and draws reasonable (but concise) conclusions about weak, semi-strong, and strong form implications. However, treatment is somewhat brief and lacks detailed statistical reporting and deeper theoretical exposition, so the work shows correct understanding but not the thorough, comprehensive depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and implements an event-study workflow (data cleaning, market-model/normal returns, abnormal returns, t-tests) and reports significance results, showing conceptual and practical understanding. However, the submission lacks methodological detail and thorough statistical reporting (e.g., estimation window, model specification, AR/CAR formulas, test statistics and exact p-values, robustness checks), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently comprehensive for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and applies an event-study to assess speed and accuracy of information incorporation, with interpretation of p-values and observed price behavior. However, the analysis lacks detailed methodological and statistical reporting (estimation window, AR/CAR formulas, exact test statistics), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Qianyue —\n\nI’ve really noticed how you’ve shifted from “idea scatter” to deliberate, repeatable analysis. In recent assignments you consistently framed problems with DRIVER: you define the decision clearly, identified the right inputs, and laid out a logical chain from assumptions to conclusions. Your habit of writing the decision question first, then mapping which financial metrics matter, shows real progress toward systematic thinking — exactly the kind of mental discipline that separates a thoughtful analyst from a busy calculator. I also appreciate how you treat AI as an execution assistant: you use it to iterate drafts and surface alternatives while keeping human judgment front and center.\n\nFor next steps, focus on three practical areas that will make your work immediately more business-ready:\n- Financial concepts → anchor each formula to economic intuition. Before you rely on a ratio or forecast, write one short sentence: “this measures X because…” Then reconcile model outputs back to that intuition (e.g., why did free cash flow fall when working capital rose?). This prevents surprising results in real deals.\n- Technical implementation → modularize and validate. Break models into small pieces (revenue, margins, capex) and add quick sanity checks or simple “unit tests” so errors are caught early. That speeds both iteration and stakeholder review.\n- Integration → translate numbers into decisions. Practice turning scenarios into recommendations: what would you recommend to a CFO if gross margin drops 200 bps? Tie model sensitivities to KPIs and action steps (pricing, cost control, capex timing).\n\nKeep treating DRIVER as a living habit. Your systematic instincts are now a career advantage — with these next steps you’ll convert clear analyses into persuasive business decisions. I’m excited to see where you take this."
