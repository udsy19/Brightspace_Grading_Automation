  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines EMH, names the three forms, and applies an event‑study (market model, abnormal returns, t‑tests) across multiple events to classify weak/semi‑strong/strong outcomes, demonstrating applied understanding. While presentation is informal and a few details are rough, the discussion and empirical application are thorough enough to meet PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student describes and executes an event‑study workflow (data verification, event dating, market model, abnormal returns, t‑tests) across multiple GME events and interprets statistical results (p‑values and economic size). While some implementation details (estimation windows, model specification) are not fully specified, the applied methodology and interpretation demonstrate thorough, correct understanding sufficient for PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tested information incorporation with an event‑study approach across multiple GME events, implemented abnormal‑return calculations and t‑tests, and interpreted statistical (p‑value) and graphical evidence to conclude which events were quick/accurate versus overreactions. Though some methodological details are informal, the applied testing and interpretation demonstrate a thorough, correct treatment appropriate for PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies behavioral explanations (notably herding/social‑media driven panic) and links them to empirical results, showing conceptual understanding. However discussion of the full set of specified biases (overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting) is cursory or absent and treatment lacks depth and specific examples, so the work merits PARTIAL under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student analyzes the GME event and discusses a general \"anomaly\" and behavioral drivers, but fails to treat the required anomaly types (momentum, value, size, calendar) individually or with examples/evidence. Because the criterion requires explicit, substantive coverage of those specific market anomalies, the submission does not meet the standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes an event‑study and data preparation but provides no explicit CAPM framework (no market beta estimation, risk‑free rate, model equation, or block‑by‑block code explanation), no demonstration of running or validating CAPM regressions, and no ownership-level explanation of implementation. Under the strict technical standard requiring explicit demonstration and code understanding, the submission fails to meet the criterion.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Qianyue — I want to first celebrate how clearly you’ve internalized the DRIVER way of thinking. You consistently break problems into logical steps, set explicit objectives before you act, and use guardrails to keep your analysis disciplined. Your work shows a shift from ad-hoc tinkering to systematic decomposition: you identify inputs, state assumptions, and drive toward measurable outputs. That transformation — from a reactive to a methodical analyst — is exactly what we aim for.\n\nNow for productive next steps you can apply immediately. A small number of financial-concept places need tightening: when you estimate project returns, double-check which cash flows belong in operating vs. financing sections (this avoids WACC/NPV misapplications in real deals). Practically, before finalizing any valuation, do a 3-step sanity check: 1) reconcile projected cash flows with historical margins on a per-product or per-segment basis; 2) run simple sensitivity scenarios (±10–20% on price, volume, margin) to see which assumptions drive value; 3) document the top three drivers in one-paragraph executive notes so a nontechnical stakeholder can judge credibility. On technical implementation, add unit tests or checklist items that validate assumptions (e.g., negative cash flows, terminal growth limits) so your models are robust in deal review.\n\nKeep going — your systematic habits are a career multiplier. Finance roles reward people who can consistently decompose messy business questions into defensible numbers and clear narratives. Treat this as iterative craft: every model, memo, and meeting is another chance to tighten assumptions and communicate impact. I’m excited to see where you take this discipline next."
