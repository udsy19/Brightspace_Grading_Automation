  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the definitions of weak, semi‑strong, and strong EMH and implements appropriate tests (autocorrelation, cumulative abnormal returns, insider-information logic) with quantitative findings (e.g., large CAR and volume spike) and interpretive discussion. Coverage is detailed and applied to the GME case across DRIVER stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual and applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents the event‑study methodology (expected return = alpha + beta*market, abnormal return = actual − expected, CAR calculation), implemented empirical tests (autocorrelation for weak form, CAR for semi‑strong) and reports numeric results (e.g., ~313% CAR) with interpretation. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the moderate standard for conceptual and methodological accuracy.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly tests how quickly/accurately public information was reflected (semi‑strong test using CAR) and reports quantitative outcomes (large CAR ~313% and 16.3× volume spike) with interpretation linking Reddit information spread to delayed/inefficient incorporation. Across DRIVER stages the work is applied, empirical, and well‑interpreted, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal‑return calculations: they state the expected‑return, abnormal‑return, and CAR formulas and report running Python to fetch data and produce results. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanations, explicit function‑level understanding, or detailed ownership of each implementation step, so the evidence supports a partial (but not full) technical demonstration.",

  "personalized_feedback": "Leon — I want to celebrate how clearly your work reflects a true DRIVER transformation. You consistently translated finance theory into a disciplined process: your valuations tie cash-flow logic to explicit assumptions, your risk adjustments follow the same decision tree each time, and your write-ups walk a reader from premise to conclusion without jumps. That steady, repeatable thinking — and your ability to integrate AI as an execution assistant while keeping the logic front-and-center — is exactly the professional habit we aim to build.\n\nFor next steps, focus on sharpening the “technical implementation” layer as a way to make your models more usable in business settings. Practical actions you can take:\n- Create an assumptions dashboard that separates inputs, mappings, and outputs so non-technical stakeholders can test scenarios quickly.\n- Build a short validation checklist for each model (reasonableness checks, conservation of cash, stress scenarios) and run it whenever you hand off work.\n- Modularize common calculations (revenue ramps, working-capital dynamics, depreciation schedules) so they’re reusable across deals or quarters and reduce rework.\n- Document one or two example scenarios with plain-English rationales aimed at CFO-level decision makers; this helps translate your systematic thinking into decisions.\n\nThese steps aren’t about making perfect files — they’re about creating auditability and repeatability so your financial logic scales with responsibility. Keep treating AI as an assistant that executes your logic framework.\n\nYou’re on a trajectory that turns disciplined thinking into career leverage: FP&A, corporate strategy, or investment roles reward people who reliably produce defensible answers under uncertainty. Stay curious, keep codifying your processes, and treat each model as a small product you can hand to a colleague. I’m excited to see where this systematic approach takes you next."
