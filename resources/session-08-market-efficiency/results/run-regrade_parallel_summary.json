You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, applied treatment of weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH: definitions, test criteria (abnormal returns), and concrete, multi-faceted application to the GameStop case with behavioral and microstructure mechanisms explaining violations. Driver stages (Discover → Implement → Validate/Reflect) are evident and support a comprehensive, expert-level discussion meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives a comprehensive, conceptually rigorous treatment of how markets incorporated new information: clearly distinguishing public vs. private/microstructure signals, citing concrete events (Ryan Cohen stake, analyst targets, Reddit coordination), and documenting persistence of mispricing. Although numerical event-study outputs are absent, the depth, multiple examples, and DRIVER-stage application satisfy the moderate standard for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defines abnormal returns and the estimation approach (market model), states the statistical criterion for EMH rejection, and applies the concept to multiple concrete aspects of the GME episode (momentum, sentiment signals, arbitrage limits). While numerical AR/CAR computations are absent, the treatment is thorough conceptually with multiple applications, meeting the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains event-study concepts (abnormal return, normal return, market model) and applies them conceptually to GME, showing understanding. However, treatment is high-level and lacks the concrete event-study implementation (estimation window, event window, AR/CAR formulas and numerical results or statistical tests), so it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explains the concept of abnormal returns and frames an event-study approach but provides no explicit calculations, numerical AR/CAR results, event/estimation window choices, statistical testing, or evidence of running code. Under the STRICT technical implementation standard requiring explicit execution and outputs, this omission fails the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly discusses verifying data and cites external evidence types (historical stock data, research findings, congressional testimony), showing they performed validation.

Their analytical depth and DRIVER-stage evidence meet the criteria for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of event-study methodology and abnormal-return calculation: they specify event windows, use a market benchmark (SPY) to compute abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns, apply this procedure to multiple concrete events, and run robustness checks. Their IMPLEMENT and REFLECT stages show both execution and critical evaluation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly addresses information incorporation: they specify and implement event-study methods to measure the timing and magnitude of market reactions, provide multiple concrete event examples showing rapid/overreactive price responses, and consider frictions (trading restrictions, limits to arbitrage) that impede accurate/fast incorporation. Robustness checks and critical reflection support a strong, well-rounded treatment meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted and described abnormal-return calculations, applied them to events, produced plots and interpreted CARs, and validated inputs — satisfying substantive implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block-by-block execution or detailed code ownership (much work was mediated by AI), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states they validated inputs and corrected factual errors, showing engagement with validation. However, they do not name the external data sources or tools used for verification, so the evidence meets the \"external validation\" intent but lacks the specific citations required for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly connects findings to broader topics (policy scrutiny, passive vs active strategy implications) and recognizes the need for robustness and further work, showing intent to extend beyond the assignment.

Coverage is substantive with specific examples and quantitative analysis, meeting the rubric's threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides multiple concrete examples (Reddit signal, hedge‑fund reaction, trading halts), date-specific empirical evidence (volume spike on Jan 22), and quantitative analysis (daily returns, CAPM expected vs actual abnormal returns) to assess how quickly and accurately information was incorporated. While not a formal econometric timing test, the combination of contextual research, data processing, and interpretation demonstrates a thorough, evidence-backed treatment consistent with the moderate standard for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student computed expected returns (CAPM) and actual daily returns, plotted and identified clear abnormal-return spikes (with date-specific volume evidence) and provided coherent explanations linking those spikes to investor behavior and market microstructure. The treatment combines quantitative output and interpretive analysis in sufficient depth to meet the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented core components of an event-study-style test (data extraction, daily returns, CAPM-based expected returns, calculation and plotting of abnormal returns, and validation/sensitivity checks) showing sound practical understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, the submission omits formal event-study methodological details (explicit event/estimation window choices, cumulative abnormal returns, and statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (daily returns, CAPM expected returns, and plotting abnormal returns) and reported running and validating outputs, showing block-level understanding. However, they repeatedly attribute code generation to the AI and do not explicitly state full personal authorship or detailed, line-by-line ownership required by the STRICT technical standard, so the work demonstrates correct implementation but not the explicit ownership required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly suggests concrete next steps and extensions that apply the study’s insights (improved input data, behavioral quantification, counterfactual visualizations), demonstrating recognition of broader use.

The treatment is detailed, applied to multiple windows, and interprets implications, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student designed and implemented a proper event-study to assess information incorporation (estimation windows, CAPM, AR/CAR) and reported statistically significant abnormal returns with robustness checks, showing prices did not immediately reflect public fundamentals.

Under the MODERATE DRIVER implementation standard, this organized workflow with multiple outputs satisfies a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly cites Yahoo Finance as an external validation source and compares its data to the prior (incorrect) claim, demonstrating result checking and correction. They also describe using external tools and iterating their code/visuals, meeting the criterion for external data and code validation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly applies their GameStop analysis beyond the assignment by recommending a passive allocation approach and drawing broader lessons for hedge funds, firms, and market structure (market frictions/arbitrage). These concrete, actionable extensions and industry‑level warnings satisfy the strict Evolve requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names and applies weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH forms to the GameStop event and cites concrete evidence (e.g., 140% short interest, price spike), showing conceptual understanding. However explanations are imprecise and sometimes confused (ambiguous phrasing about what constitutes a violation), and treatment lacks the depth and rigor required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies abnormal returns and cites the basic AR formula and uses CAPM/risk‑free and market return concepts, plus implemented code and visualizations—showing conceptual grasp. However, they do not present a formal event‑study methodology (estimation/event windows, model regression, CAR computation, or statistical testing), so coverage is correct but incomplete and not sufficiently detailed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies failures in information incorporation (claims about semi‑strong form violations and unpriced short interest) and implemented data/visual analysis, showing conceptual grasp.

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH and applies them to the GameStop case with specific data-driven evidence and discussion (Implement + Reflect). Coverage is substantive, uses concrete examples (Ryan Cohen disclosure, timeline, validated prices) and explains why each EMH form is held or violated, meeting the rubric's requirement for a thorough, applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student used validated price data and a clear timeline (e.g., Ryan Cohen disclosure in Sept vs. price spike in Jan) to show markets did not immediately incorporate public information, quantified the lag, and explained mechanisms (social media, limits to arbitrage). This constitutes a thorough, applied treatment appropriate for a moderate evaluation (conceptual discussion supported by data), meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market‑efficiency testing problem: objective, relevant EMH hypotheses, specific claims to verify, and the data/time windows required. That explicit framing satisfies the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly collected and validated price data and used it to discuss EMH qualitatively (Discover + Implement + Reflect). However, they did not perform a formal event‑study (no market/benchmark model, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, estimation/event windows, or statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but basic and incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The transcript shows data collection and reporting of raw prices/averages but contains no evidence of abnormal‑return computation, market/benchmark model, estimation/event windows, cumulative abnormal returns, or statistical testing. Under the strict technical implementation standard requiring explicit demonstration and ownership of abnormal‑return calculations, the student did not attempt or document these steps, so the criterion fails.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student correctly identifies and explains why abnormal returns arose (delayed incorporation of public news, social‑media driven herding, and limits to arbitrage) and supports this with data collection. However, they did not explicitly define abnormal returns nor compute or quantify them (no abnormal‑return or CAR calculations), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete.",

This combination of conceptual explanation plus data-driven application and reflection meets the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student both computed and interpreted abnormal-return metrics (CAR, autocorrelation, Sharpe) and connected them to concrete trade examples and behavioral/market-structure drivers (social media, short interest, liquidity). This combination of quantitative outputs plus clear explanatory linkage meets the moderate-standard requirement for a thorough, integrated explanation of abnormal returns.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (targets, data, and what constitutes violations) and documented the discovery steps (timeline, historical data). This provides a clear, defendable Define & Discover stage consistent with DRIVER and meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented and reported event-related metrics (returns, autocorrelation, cumulative abnormal return, Sharpe) and applied them to the GME event, showing conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks methodological detail required for a thorough event study (no explicit benchmark/expected-return model, estimation/event window definitions, or statistical significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets delayed information incorporation (semi-strong violation) and supports this with timeline-based metrics and examples of abnormal returns. However, the treatment omits key event-study details (explicit expected-return benchmark, estimation/event window definitions, and statistical significance testing), so the conceptual application is present but not methodologically thorough.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports abnormal-return metrics, the submission lacks the strict, explicit technical demonstration required: no block-by-block code explanation, no statement of personally running and verifying each computation, no description of the abnormal-return formula/benchmark or estimation/event windows, and no ownership-level walkthrough.

They also provided plausible behavioral and limits‑to‑arbitrage explanations for why abnormal returns persisted, meeting the criterion's requirement for thorough explanation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the Define & Discover objective, performed fact verification (correcting the August 2020 price), and produced a detailed event timeline tying events to the market‑efficiency question—meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit plan for analyzing market efficiency—specified methodology (event study), model (CAPM), precise estimation and event windows, metrics (AR/CAR) and hypothesis test—satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and tested weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and implemented an event-study (Represent/Implement), providing specific results that support a semi-strong violation.

Coverage is specific, correctly links tech results to financial causes, and meets the moderate standard for thorough conceptual integration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the problem, stated precise research questions (which EMH form was implicated), and identified measurable tests and scope (verify price facts, event-study of abnormal returns and frictions). This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit plan for analysis (choice of stock and benchmark, precise date range, event-study design with ±10-day window, and expected-return model), and described how it would be executed. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage and is actionable for implementation and review.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and framed an evaluative question, then applied an event-study (implement/validate) to assess semi-strong implications and discussed behavioral limits to arbitrage. However, treatment lacks thorough, form-by-form testing (e.g., weak-form predictability tests or deeper strong-form discussion), so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented an event-study framework, computed abnormal returns, and reported summary statistics, demonstrating conceptual understanding and basic execution. However the methodology is simplistic (using raw S&P returns as the expected model, small sample/window, minimal statistical robustness and no formal cumulative abnormal return tests or controls), so the work is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly conceptualized and tested information incorporation using an event-study and reported abnormal-return statistics, showing awareness of timing and post-event behavior.

This explicit goal-setting and methodological outline satisfies the Define & Discover requirement under the DRIVER framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission contains a clear, ordered plan for analyzing market efficiency with explicit tasks, required outputs, and tools—fulfilling the Represent-stage requirement for an explicit layout. Although code blocks/results are not shown here, the methodological plan itself is explicitly stated and defendable.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly connects assignment findings to broader contexts—behavioral finance explanations, average-investor implications, and their future actuarial work—demonstrating application beyond the task. These clear reflections and intended real‑world uses satisfy the Evolve-stage requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the event as a semi-strong EMH violation and cites concrete evidence (140% short interest, Reddit coordination) and a data-based approach, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is uneven — discussion focuses on the semi-strong case with limited explicit comparison to weak and strong forms and lacks systematic, thorough analysis required for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set up an event-study objective, imported and processed data, and discussed abnormal returns qualitatively and via a sensitivity table, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not present explicit event-study methodology or quantitative abnormal-return calculations (no market model/estimation window, AR/CAR computations, or statistical tests), so the treatment is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes that publicly available short-interest information was not immediately reflected (a semi‑strong information‑incorporation issue) and used real data tools to investigate, showing conceptual understanding.

Minor presentation/code refinements were noted, but the methodological steps and empirical calculations were thoroughly applied, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student executed a complete event-study: clear event window, CAPM-based expected returns, abnormal and cumulative abnormal return calculations, statistical testing, and temporal visualization. Their interpretation—rejection of semi-strong efficiency and sustained abnormal returns—directly addresses the speed and accuracy of information incorporation, meeting the standards for a thorough, knowledgeable treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly computed abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns using CAPM-based expected returns, produced statistical tests (t‑stats/p‑values), reported a numeric CAR (spike ~4.10) and interpreted significance. They connected the empirical AR/CAR findings to economic interpretation (ex‑post gamble vs. risk‑adjusted opportunity), meeting the standards for a thorough, applied explanation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied and interpreted tests for weak form (autocorrelation) and semi-strong form (abnormal returns/CAR) demonstrating conceptual understanding and empirical application, but did not address or test the strong form explicitly. Coverage is accurate and applied but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (AR/CAR) and produced code and statistical outputs, showing practical implementation. However, under the strict technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block-by-block execution/verification or detailed explanation of code functions—rather they relied on and modified AI-generated code—so the work shows correct attempt but not the required explicit ownership/detail for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal validation (fact‑checking the baseline, iterating code, and reporting statistical tests), demonstrating awareness of data/code checks.

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student systematically implemented their plan: they coded multiple VaR methods, simulated outcomes (10,000 Monte Carlo), calculated expected shortfalls, ran stress tests, and re-evaluated after rebalancing—producing consistent numeric outputs. That sequence demonstrates organized, repeatable execution of the analytical workflow, meeting the Implement-stage standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly comments on what part of the work was most important, connects model results to the real 8% event, and recommends actionable changes (portfolio reallocation to reduce market sensitivity). Those are clear, explicit reflections that extend beyond mere reporting, satisfying the Reflect-stage requirement.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student presents multiple empirically generated results (different VaR methods, ES, Monte Carlo) and links them logically to the motivating event (market-crash scenario ≈ 8% loss). They interpret those outputs and apply them (rebalancing), showing a coherent, evidence-driven narrative that satisfies the criterion for logical presentation of empirical evidence.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains no discussion of the weak, semi-strong, or strong forms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. While the student correctly implemented risk methods and made modeling assumptions (e.g., zero expected return) and reflected on diversification, they did not address or demonstrate understanding of EMH forms, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript shows thorough VaR and stress-testing work but contains no discussion or execution of event-study steps (event/estimation windows, expected return model, abnormal returns, CAR/CUMAR, or significance testing). Because the required event-study methodology and abnormal-return calculations are missing, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion, testing, or measurement of how rapidly or accurately prices reflect new information (no event-study, abnormal-return analysis, discussion of announcement effects, or market reaction timing). Although the student built a daily monitoring VaR system and reflected on crash scenarios, they did not address the information-incorporation criterion, so it fails.",

These elements show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a coherent workflow—data verification, data ingestion, AR calculation, visualization, and hypothesis testing—and reported statistical outcomes and interpretation. While some methodological specifics (event/estimation windows, benchmark model) were not detailed, the implemented sequence produced multiple analytical outputs and a reasoned conclusion, satisfying a systematic implementation standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compared their data/code outputs against a named external source (finance.yahoo), identified a clear discrepancy, and used code to verify the values—meeting the Validate requirement for external validation. This demonstrates satisfactory data and code checks under the moderate DRIVER validation standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes abnormal returns and post‑announcement drift, and they implemented an event‑study style test (AR calculations, t-test on abnormal returns) using historical adjusted prices. However, the methodology lacks key details (event/estimation windows, benchmark model for expected returns, standard error treatment) and the analysis is brief, so it demonstrates correct but incomplete application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes how semi‑strong efficiency relates to public information and implemented an empirical test (AR calculations, t‑test) on event data, showing some evidence of delayed incorporation (post‑announcement drift). However, the analysis lacks key methodological details (event/estimation windows, benchmark model, precise timing of price reactions) and so demonstrates a correct but incomplete treatment of how quickly and accurately markets incorporate new information.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student attempted abnormal‑return analysis (AR graph, t‑test, p‑value), they relied on AI‑generated code and did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, or methodological details required by the STRICT rubric.

Coverage includes multiple supporting examples and a clear explanation of mechanisms driving the abnormal returns, meeting the threshold for thorough conceptual integration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem (event, scope, and factual corrections) and articulated the data/assumption questions required before analysis, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage. Evidence shows clear ownership of the problem definition and deliberate restriction to the discovery stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission includes an explicit, actionable represent-stage plan listing event/estimation windows, required variables, model choices (CAPM), and planned tests for EMH and behavioral hypotheses, and it connects that plan to implementation (data period and event window). That satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit represent-stage layout even though no separate diagram was provided.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and intends to test weak, semi-strong, and strong forms and uses relevant empirical indicators (abnormal returns, short interest, volume, absence of insider information). However the treatment is more descriptive than thorough: definitions and explicit mapping of evidence to each EMH form are brief or implicit rather than fully developed, so the response demonstrates correct but incomplete understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and plans the key components of an event study and abnormal-return calculations and reports large accumulated abnormal returns, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the submission lacks thorough methodological detail (explicit formulas, estimation window length, model specification, and statistical test results), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies relevant information flows (social-media spikes, short-interest) and proposes appropriate event-study methods, and reports large abnormal returns consistent with slow/biased information incorporation. However, the submission lacks explicit, quantitative measurement of the speed of incorporation (timing around specific information releases), formal statistical timing tests, and detailed results tying specific information events to immediate price adjustments, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, listed specific objectives (fact verification, form tests, profitability, behavioral explanations), and presented a concrete task plan. That explicit framing and linkage to planned implementation satisfies the strict \"Define & Discover\" requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, stepwise plan enumerating specific tasks (data, charts, volume, form tests, C chart) and linked those tasks to the project's objectives, satisfying the requirement for an explicit plan/layout. Although not presented as a formal flowchart, the sequence and mapping to implementation are explicit and sufficient under the strict standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, ordered workflow (tasks 2–6), executed code to retrieve and analyze data, produced multiple outputs (price/volume charts, autocorrelation test, cumulative abnormal returns) and interpreted results. This demonstrates systematic implementation of the Python-based analysis sufficient for a PASS under the moderate DRIVER-Implement standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests weak-form efficiency (autocorrelation / Elgin/Box test) and argues semi-strong violation using large cumulative abnormal returns detached from fundamentals, with supporting charts and code. However, treatment is incomplete for a full PASS because the strong-form (insider/private information) is not addressed and overall depth on theoretical implications is limited.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-study outputs (computed abnormal returns/CAR and ran statistical tests) and used code to generate charts and data, showing practical implementation. However, the submission omits key methodological detail required for a thorough event-study: no description of the expected-return model/benchmark, estimation and event windows, AR calculation formula, or significance testing procedure for CARs — therefore competent but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and evidences that prices diverged from public fundamentals (large CAR and price/volume spike), indicating information was not reflected in prices as EMH predicts. However, the analysis lacks explicit timing/event-window tests or granular measures of how quickly information was incorporated (no intraday/event-window specification or formal speed tests), so treatment is correct but incomplete.",

These elements meet the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage and provide a defensible plan for analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, ordered plan and produced multiple implementation outputs (model estimates, graphs, abnormal-return findings) consistent with their Represent stage.

This provides a clear, defendable setup for the subsequent DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly articulated a concrete plan for analyzing market efficiency: specified the market-model approach (CAPM), estimation window, formulas (expected return, AR, CAR), and subsequent statistical test and visualizations. This explicit mapping from objectives to methods satisfies the strict requirement for a clear Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, organized workflow from problem definition through model specification to execution and validation: they retrieved data, computed log returns, estimated CAPM parameters, produced abnormal returns and cumulative ARs, ran a t-test, and created visuals. Multiple concrete outputs and stated methods show systematic implementation consistent with the Represent plan, satisfying the criterion for Implement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and tests weak-form efficiency using an event-study approach (CAPM, ARs, CARs, t-test) and offers behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage explanations, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete: semi-strong and strong forms are asserted rather than rigorously tested or defined (no explicit semi-strong announcement tests or discussion of insider-information implications), and some phrasing is unclear, so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements core event-study components (CAPM market model, AR/CAR calculations, t-test) and specifies estimation/event windows, showing solid conceptual execution. However the treatment lacks depth and robustness (e.g., details on event-window length, inference adjustments, cross-checks, clarity on reported CAR magnitude and units), so it is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied appropriate event-study tools (AR/CAR, CAPM, t-test) that are directly relevant to assessing how markets incorporate information, and they provided interpretation tying persistence of ARs to behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage factors.

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the problem (testing market efficiency for the GameStop short-squeeze against EMH predictions), scoped it with a timeline of key events, and stated the plan to compare event prices to historical data. These explicit statements satisfy the Define & Discover requirement under the DRIVER framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission explicitly applies efficiency insights to wider issues (regulation, disclosure, active vs passive implications) and links them to theoretical interpretation, satisfying the Evolve requirement. The student also documents iterative analytic work that informed these extensions, so the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides explicit reflective comments about the process and their personal perspective, and connects analytic insights to broader implications (policy and investor behavior). Those concrete reflective statements and extensions satisfy the strict requirement for an explicit reflection.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies EMH concepts (notably arguing semi-strong form was violated using short-interest evidence) and mentions weak/strong forms with behavioral context, indicating conceptual understanding. However treatment is brief and uneven (limited discussion of weak- and strong-form implications and no systematic tests or multiple detailed examples), so it meets PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student names \"market efficiency testing\" and notes using Python, but the submission contains no explicit event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, model for expected returns, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, or statistical testing). Despite DRIVER-stage work, the core technical methods required for this criterion are missing, so the response fails to demonstrate competence.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses information incorporation conceptually (identifying a semi-strong violation and citing public short-interest and event timeline), showing basic understanding. However, they do not present measures of speed/accuracy (no event-window timing, abnormal-return calculations, or statistical testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

They verify key data (Implement) and use Validate/Evolve to provide specific, applied examples and explanations, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student directly addresses how quickly/accurately markets incorporated public short-interest information (noting months-long availability but delayed price response) and supports this with timeline evidence (flat prices then explosive surge), technical indicators, and a concrete market-structure example (140% short interest). This multi-faceted, applied discussion meets the moderate-category standard for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the testing problem, set explicit time bounds, and specified data inputs and limitations, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student verified data and discussed EMH qualitatively, but there is no evidence of an event-study methodology (no event/estimation windows, no expected-return model or market model, no abnormal or cumulative abnormal return calculations, and no statistical testing).

The conceptual detail and applied example with implementation and reflection meet the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explains the theoretical benchmark (immediate incorporation), contrasts it with slow/overreacting adjustments, presents a concrete earnings-drift example and abnormal-return calculation, implements code to test it, and reflects on statistical/economic significance and persistence. That combination of conceptual detail, applied example, implementation, and reflection satisfies a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations conceptually and planned/started code and validation criteria, but did not explicitly demonstrate running the code, verify outputs, or provide block-level explanation/ownership as required by the strict technical standard.

This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS under moderate standards, though some statistical detail (test statistics/robustness) could deepen rigor.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly explains what an abnormal return is, specifies the event-study design (model, windows, market proxy), reports implementation outputs (pre-event alpha/beta, CAR) and contextualizes results with market-microstructure evidence. Coverage is applied, specific, and ties technical computation to financial interpretation, meeting the threshold for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the core problem, outlines the DRIVER stages starting with \"define and discover,\" and documents initial fact verification—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover demonstration. This clear framing and planned workflow justify a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies and interprets the semi-strong form in the GME context, uses an event study to support claims, and connects limits to arbitrage and behavioral drivers to EMH breakdown — showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is incomplete for the criterion because weak and strong forms are not explicitly defined or contrasted in depth; coverage is focused primarily on the semi-strong case.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies an event-study to assess information incorporation and provides qualitative interpretation supported by CAR and market-microstructure indicators. However, the treatment lacks quantitative detail on the timing/pace of incorporation (no explicit intra-window timing metrics, statistical timing tests, or robustness checks), so the coverage is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports abnormal-return outputs and an event-study plan, they attribute code generation to Google Gemini and do not demonstrate having run, inspected, or explained the code themselves.

They also tied the plan to concrete implementation actions (printing data frames) and validation, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Represent stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, repeatable workflow: data acquisition, preprocessing (column standardization), descriptive statistics, visualizations, and computation of returns/volatility, plus external validation. This shows systematic execution of the planned Python analysis across multiple outputs, meeting the Implement-stage requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses EMH in context and offers behavioral explanations for the anomaly, demonstrating conceptual understanding and relevant data work (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT). However, they do not explain or apply the specific weak, semi-strong, and strong forms of EMH or provide detailed examples distinguishing them, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated returns/volatility and compared GME to the market, demonstrating partial capability to assess market efficiency (IMPLEMENT/REFLECT). However, they did not describe or perform key event-study steps (estimation window, market model, abnormal returns/CARs, statistical testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes information-incorporation issues and computed returns/volatility and market comparisons (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT), showing conceptual awareness. However, they did not perform formal timing analysis (e.g., intraday or event-window abnormal returns, market-model estimation, or statistical tests) to show how quickly information was reflected, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

Minor gaps (no numeric tables or robustness checks reported) do not negate that the methodology and abnormal‑return calculations were thoroughly and correctly applied, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student specifies an event date, applies the standard event‑study procedure (estimation window, OLS market model, abnormal returns and CAR) and explicitly concludes the market did not instantaneously incorporate public information, linking empirical results to behavioral and arbitrage constraints. While some numeric robustness details are limited, the conceptual and applied treatment of information incorporation is thorough enough under the moderate standard, so PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly explains the abnormal‑return concept and applies the event‑study workflow (benchmark model, estimation window, OLS estimation, AR and CAR computation) to the GME case and reports statistical significance. The discussion links computed abnormal returns to plausible economic mechanisms (limits to arbitrage, behavioral coordination), providing a thorough, applied explanation that meets the PASS standard for this moderate criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct conceptual understanding and applied methodology for weak and especially semi-strong tests (event study, market model, CAR with statistical interpretation), but it does not present a substantive test or discussion of the strong form (insider-information implications) and lacks comprehensive empirical detail. Therefore the treatment is correct and applied but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal‑return calculations (market model OLS, AR and CAR computation) and reported statistically significant results, demonstrating applied implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit personal execution verification, block‑by‑block code explanation, or detailed validation outputs, so the evidence supports only a PARTIAL pass.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student shows efforts at validation (correcting input data and citing the SEC report) and describes code checks, which indicates some external comparison.

Although execution details are not shown here (handled in other criteria), the methodological layout is specific and defensible.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student described a clear, ordered implementation (data windows, benchmark, regression for alpha/beta, AR/CAR plotting) and reported concrete outputs (graphical window and volatility figures), demonstrating systematic execution of their plan.

The work supplies multiple concrete measures (percent abnormal returns, CAR behavior, t-statistic) and interprets persistence vs immediate discovery, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate-evidence category.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly defined abnormal returns, explained the CAPM-based calculation, implemented an event-study workflow in code, and reported quantified AR/CAR results with interpretation. Coverage includes conceptual definition, methodological application, numerical outcomes, and implications—meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the research question (testing semi-strong EMH), specified the chosen methodology (event study), and contextualized the test with identified events—meeting the strict requirement for a clear, defensible Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a correct and applied understanding of the semi-strong form (definition, event-study method, CAPM, significance testing), but it does not discuss the weak or strong forms or contrast them with the semi-strong form. Because coverage is accurate and applied for semi-strong but incomplete across the three EMH forms, the appropriate rating is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study framework and calculated abnormal returns using CAPM, with reported CARs and hypothesis testing, showing practical implementation and validation. However, methodological details (estimation window, beta estimation procedure, event-window specification, inference adjustments) and clarity on some reported statistics are missing or inconsistent, so the treatment is accurate but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal-return calculations (CAPM-based ARs, CARs) and ran code producing statistics and a t-test, showing personal implementation and validation.

Multiple organized outputs (event-study and price/fundamental plot) and validation steps show methodical execution, satisfying the criterion despite reserving deeper quantitative steps for next work.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the three EMH forms and designs/implements visual tests (Represent/Implement) comparing market price to public fundamentals, supporting a claim of semi-strong violation. However, the treatment is not thorough: definitions and mechanistic explanation of each form (especially the claimed weak-form violation and the strong form) are limited or absent, so the understanding is correct but basic rather than comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly understands event-study goals and implemented data collection plus visual analysis, demonstrating conceptual grasp. However, they did not perform abnormal-return calculations or statistical CAR testing (only proposed it as a next step), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding and produced visual event-study evidence suggesting public fundamentals were not reflected (semi-strong concern) and discussed operational reasons (shortage of shares, margin calls).

However the treatment is high-level and inconsistent (brief, sometimes contradictory claims about weak/strong form violations) and lacks thorough, systematic argumentation and multiple supporting analyses required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed an event-study question and implemented data retrieval and visualization, but did not perform formal event-study steps (no estimation window, expected-return model, abnormal return or cumulative abnormal return calculations, nor significance testing). This shows conceptual understanding and basic application but lacks the methodological depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly framed information-incorporation as an empirical question and implemented data retrieval and visualization (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT).

They paired conceptual discussion with an empirical plan and reflected on frictions that reconcile anomalies with EMH, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, well-specified event-study methodology (estimation/event windows, market model/CAPM beta, AR/CAR, significance tests, sensitivity checks) and attempted implementation, meeting the thorough conceptual and practical requirements for this moderate-evaluation criterion. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) support both rigor in setup and attention to execution issues, justifying a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames speed and accuracy of information incorporation as an empirical target, specifies an event-study approach to measure it, and provides concrete interpretations (e.g., rapid reactions, processing bottlenecks, trading constraints). These elements demonstrate a thorough conceptual and methodological treatment consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specified the event-study design and stated they would compute abnormal returns and estimate beta, showing conceptual and procedural knowledge. However, they did not demonstrate successful, personal execution or provide block-by-block code understanding or verified AR outputs (they encountered errors and delegated debugging to an AI), so the strict technical standard is only partially met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly validated data against an external source (Yahoo Finance) and attempted to run analysis code, showing attention to validation. However, they did not demonstrate successful, self-owned code debugging or explain code blocks line-by-line; they delegated fixes to an AI.

Coverage is specific, applied to the GME case, and shows a strong conceptual grasp consistent with a thorough treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student not only documents the abnormal magnitude (10,000% rise) but links observable signals (golden cross/momentum) to realized returns and provides a detailed causal explanation (behavioral narrative, short-squeeze mechanics, borrowing costs, broker actions) for why excess returns occurred and persisted. While no formal AR/CAR computations are shown, the conceptual and applied explanation is thorough and meets the moderate standard for this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, states hypotheses and scope, and provides a concrete, ordered plan and initial verification steps that operationalize the discovery. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies relevant empirical tests (SMA momentum plots, comparing price to public short-interest data) and implements data verification and plotting, showing conceptual understanding of event analysis. However, they do not present a formal event-study methodology or any abnormal-return calculations (estimation window, market model, CAR/AR, or statistical inference), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and illustrates information-incorporation issues with specific public events and qualitative evidence that the market was slow and inaccurate (e.g., 140% short interest, Ryan Cohen stake). However, the treatment lacks quantitative timing/accuracy measures (no timelines, statistical tests, or formal event-window analysis), so the understanding is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes plotting and SMA tests and draws conclusions, but there is no explicit attempt or demonstration of abnormal-return calculations (no event window, market model/benchmark, AR/CAR computation, or statistical inference), and the strict implementation standard requires explicit, personal demonstration of those calculations.

This clear statement of objective, scope, and planned methodology satisfies the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly laid out the analysis plan—data source and event windows, the market-model approach, and the sequence from regression to AR/CAR calculation—satisfying the Represent stage's requirement for a clear plan. Because these steps and the planned workflow are stated rather than merely implied, the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, organized implementation: sourced data, defined event windows, ran coded market-model regressions, computed ARs/CARs, and reported numerical results and significance. That systematic pipeline and multiple outputs (graphs, regression parameters, AR/CAR values) meet the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows correct conceptual use of EMH in context (event-study metrics, limits to arbitrage, behavioral factors) and applies those ideas to the GameStop case, but it does not explicitly define or distinguish the weak, semi-strong, and strong EMH forms. That correct but incomplete treatment fits PARTIAL under the moderate standard: understanding is present and applied, but not thorough/comprehensive across the three EMH forms.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study approach (market model, alpha/beta, ARs and CARs) and reported numerical results and significance considerations, demonstrating functional implementation. However, methodological details (e.g., estimation window, exact event-window specification, statistical test procedures) are not fully documented, so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive, yielding a PARTIAL score.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied event-study tools and discussed whether prices reflected information (showing conceptual understanding and numerical results), but did not rigorously measure the speed/accuracy of incorporation (e.g., explicit event-window timing, statistical tests of immediate adjustment, or robustness checks).

The statements show clear, personal framing of the task and data collection sufficient for this DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear plan/layout: collect and tabulate price/return data, estimate expected returns via an OLS/CAPM model, compute abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns, perform significance tests, and visualize results. Those explicit steps constitute a concrete representational plan for analyzing market efficiency and meet the strict requirement for this DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow—data acquisition, tabulation, model estimation, statistical calculation, and visualization—producing multiple outputs (tables, stats, charts) that implement the planned analysis. While some low-level methodological details are omitted, the end-to-end systematic execution meets the moderate DRIVER Implement standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected and analyzed event-return data (Discover/Implement) and correctly computed abnormal returns and significance. However their interpretation of EMH forms is confused and incorrect (they equate significant abnormal returns with \"strong\" or \"weak form\" efficiency), so the conceptual understanding of weak/semi-strong/strong forms is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates key elements of an event study (data collection, model estimation, abnormal return and cumulative abnormal return calculation, and statistical testing), but treatment is high-level and lacking methodological specifics (e.g., precise model specification, estimation window, how expected returns were computed/validated, and robustness checks). Thus the work is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student performed the core event-study calculations (abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, significance testing) showing partial mastery of information incorporation methods.

However, they do not quantify adjustment speed or present formal tests/measures of information incorporation (e.g., precise event-window timing, econometric tests of market reaction speed), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student presents AR/CAR graphs and significance results, they do not explicitly show the abnormal-return calculation steps, expected-return model, event/estimation windows, formulas, code execution statements, or block-by-block explanations required by the strict technical standard.

This combination of definition, applied examples, quantitative implementation, and reflection meets the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly defined and computed abnormal returns (actual minus expected), provided code and concrete numeric results, and interpreted those abnormal returns with plausible finance and tech-integrated explanations (behavioral overshooting, momentum, limits to scalability). The work demonstrates both technical implementation and thoughtful integration of financial interpretation, meeting the rubric's requirement for a thorough treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the testing problem—testing market efficiency for GameStop—by correcting factual context, laying out a detailed event timeline of information shocks, and specifying the analytical metric (CAPM expected vs actual returns). These explicit elements satisfy the DRIVER \"Define & Discover\" requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used a CAPM benchmark and coded/reported abnormal-return calculations, showing practical implementation (Implement) and event framing (Discover). However, the submission lacks key event-study details (specified event/estimation windows, beta estimation method, statistical significance or cumulative abnormal returns), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discussed how markets incorporated public information (semi-strong form) and provided quantitative abnormal-return results, showing conceptual and implementation effort. However, they did not provide rigorous timing metrics (event/estimation windows, intraday reaction or statistical significance) needed for a thorough test of speed/accuracy, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student reported abnormal-return numbers and referenced Python code (Implement/Represent), they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block understanding, ownership of the code, or provide methodological details (event/estimation windows, beta estimation, or how the code was run).

Under the strict DRIVER standard requiring explicit demonstration of the problem definition, this meets the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a clear, explicit plan: data acquisition, specific tests (weak- and semi-strong), required formulas (expected return, AR, CAR), tools, and next-step analyses (social media linkage). This verbal plan satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit represent-stage layout.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed external validation by naming Yahoo Finance, comparing the 4-cent claim to Yahoo's historical data, and presenting a chart as evidence. This meets the validate-stage requirement to use a specific external source and compare results, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and conceptually applies weak- and semi-strong form tests, uses data and charts, and links behavioral explanations—showing understanding. However treatment is basic (visual inspection, no quantitative abnormal-return/CAR analysis, no explicit discussion of strong-form implications), so the work demonstrates correct but incomplete coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies event-study components (expected return model, abnormal returns, CAR) and obtained data, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not perform the actual abnormal-return calculations or present CAR/event-window results—analysis remained primarily visual—so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding by naming semi-strong tests and proposing mapping news to price moves and abnormal-return methods.

This meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the DRIVER stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provided a clear, explicit represent-stage plan with concrete methods (Python/YFinance, moving averages) and a qualitative comparison for semi-strong testing, satisfying the strict requirement for an articulated analysis layout. Discover and Implement stages support that the plan was grounded and actionable.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a clear, systematic workflow from plan to code to output, producing multiple analysis artifacts (price/volume charts and MA plots) that align with their represent-stage plan. Although some analyses were noted as still being refined, the methodological execution is organized and yields concrete results, meeting the criterion for systematic implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses weak and semi-strong forms and describes concrete tests (moving averages, comparison to public fundamentals), showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is incomplete (the weak-form test was not fully realized, the strong form is not addressed, and the analysis relies on qualitative inference), so the work demonstrates correct but basic coverage rather than the thorough depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student collected data and discussed basic tests (moving averages) but did not describe or execute an event-study methodology (event/estimation windows, benchmark model) nor compute abnormal or cumulative abnormal returns. Given the specific criterion requires event-study and abnormal-return calculations, the submission is missing the required analyses.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how market prices related to public information (semi-strong form) and uses data/volume visuals to support the claim, showing conceptual understanding.

While code blocks aren't shown, the transcript documents personal execution, block-level descriptions (percentage change, rolling std, abnormal return = asset − market), and validation—meeting the strict requirement for attempted abnormal-return calculation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the market-efficiency testing problem, lists concrete objectives, and sets clear temporal and benchmark boundaries—meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover stage.

Coverage includes implementation details, robustness checks, and reflection, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applied an event‑study methodology, produced regression results and significance tests, and used window and rolling‑CAR analyses to assess speed of information incorporation, directly addressing the criterion. Robustness checks and the interpretation of multi‑day drift support a thorough, evidence‑based conclusion that markets did not instantly incorporate the new information.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, verified data and key events, and outlined the methodological approach and scope—meeting the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover articulation. Evidence shows both problem definition and planned analysis, so this criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied an event-study (CAPM) to test semi-strong efficiency and reported statistically significant abnormal returns, showing conceptual and empirical understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, treatment is narrowly focused on the semi-strong form without thorough definitions, comparisons to weak/strong forms, or multiple detailed examples required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly attempted abnormal return calculations, ran regressions, computed ARs/CARs, and reported statistical tests and robustness checks (Implement + Validate). However, under the STRICT technical requirement they did not provide explicit code, block‑by‑block explanation, or detailed verification steps demonstrating ownership and reproducibility, so the work is only partially demonstrated.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student calculated and reported abnormal returns, ran robustness checks, and proposed plausible explanations linking ARs to market frictions and behavioral forces.

Coverage is applied and specific rather than superficial, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the testing problem, the case study, and clear objectives (what will be tested and how), meeting the strict requirement for an explicit Define & Discover statement. The transcript shows both the high-level research question and immediate verification/action steps, indicating a well-defined problem.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student follows a clear, structured workflow (verify data → compute/analyze abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns → assess volume/volatility and fundamental valuation) and reports multiple analytic outputs, indicating systematic execution of the planned analysis. Although no explicit mention of Python code is in the transcript, the methodological implementation and multiple results meet the moderate criterion for systematic execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets abnormal returns and frames an event-study style investigation (Discover/Implement/Reflect), showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not present event-study mechanics (expected-return model, estimation window, abnormal-return calculation formula, or significance testing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses how new information (and social-media-driven signals) failed to be reflected immediately and notes subsequent correction, showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation. However, they do not quantify speed/accuracy (no timing analysis, event-window results, or statistical tests), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student mentions abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns conceptually but provides no explicit abnormal-return calculations, formulas, estimation/event windows, code, or evidence of personally running/validating computations.

Their reflection links empirical findings to the semi-strong form and discusses behavioral/limits-to-arbitrage factors, demonstrating a strong, applied conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study workflow (model choice, estimation window, event window, AR/CAR calculation, and statistical testing) and applies it to interpret outcomes, showing both implementation and reflection. These specifics and the interpretation meet the standard for a thorough, applied treatment of event-study methodology.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only framed the information-incorporation question but implemented an appropriate event-study (model, estimation/event windows, AR/CAR, t-tests) and interpreted timing and accuracy of market response (event-day significance followed by quick mean reversion). This combination of method and interpretation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly describes the event-study methodology, parameters, and reports results, showing an attempted and partially executed AR/CAR calculation.

Although concise, the definition and planned linkage to Represent-stage components meet the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of the Define & Discover stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a clear, organized workflow from planning (mapping period/windows and formulas) to execution (Python implementation, stock and abnormal return calculation) and validation (statistical significance/tests). While numeric detail is limited, the systematic multi-stage execution aligns with the DRIVER Implement expectations for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student presents a clear, logical empirical narrative from data verification through analytic design to implementation, validation, and interpretation—showing coherent sequencing of evidence. Although numeric detail and explicit tables/plots are absent, the structured DRIVER-based presentation and stated statistical checks satisfy the moderate standard for a thorough logical presentation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual awareness (mentions the three EMH forms and runs an event-study with abnormal returns), and interprets results (claims a semi-strong violation). However treatment is brief and imprecise—definitions, diagnostic distinctions between weak/semi-strong/strong, and detailed supporting analysis/tests are not fully developed, so the submission is a partial (not thorough) demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly implemented an event-study workflow (stock returns, abnormal returns, Python code) and mentions statistical testing, showing correct conceptual application. However, treatment lacks depth and specifics (no formulas, test names, estimation window details, or reported results), so the methodology is demonstrated but not thoroughly documented.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual approach (event study, abnormal returns, statistical testing) relevant to measuring how markets incorporate information, but provides no specific timing metrics (event/estimation windows), quantitative results, or detailed discussion of speed/accuracy of incorporation.

The depth of analysis across Discover, Implement, and Reflect meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a complete event-study workflow: defined estimation and event windows, implemented a market-model expected return, computed ARs/CARs, and applied significance testing including bootstrap CIs. This combination of methodological detail, implementation evidence, and interpretation across Discover/Implement/Reflect meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student executed a proper event-study approach (estimation window, market-model expected returns, AR/CAR) and applied statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap CIs) across multiple event windows, providing concrete evidence that abnormal returns persisted around the January events. While intraday speed was not analyzed, the combination of methodology, multiple event examples, and interpretation of persistent ARs demonstrates a thorough treatment of how quickly and accurately markets incorporated new information, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly checked and corrected the data and ran internal validation (t-tests and bootstrap) which shows effort to validate results. However, they did not name or cite external data sources/tools used for cross-checking (only promise to attach a snapshot), so external validation is incomplete per the rubric, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly invoked and applied EMH forms to the GameStop episode and tied empirical results to semi-strong violation, demonstrating understanding.

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student names a specific external source (TradingView) and reports using it to validate the reported prices, which meets the requirement for external data validation. While validation is limited to a single source and no code checks are shown, the criterion accepts external validation and is therefore satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly applies efficiency insights beyond the assignment by drawing broader market implications (retail power, meme-coin emergence) and giving a general caution about EMH—meeting the Evolve requirement. The extension is clear and directly tied to the discovered evidence, satisfying the STRICT expectation for explicit demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides explicit, evaluative comments about the assignment's implications (risk to investors, limits of EMH) and connects those reflections to broader market changes, satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit reflection stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the weak- and semi-strong-form ideas to the GameStop episode with supporting examples, but treatment is brief and lacks explanation of the strong form (no discussion of insider/private information or why it failed). Given correct but incomplete coverage, the response meets PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of event-study methodology (estimation window, normal-return model, abnormal-return calculation, cumulative abnormal returns) nor any statistical testing or numeric abnormal-return results. Given the absence of methodological description or calculations, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses that public and historical information did not produce accurate prices (identifying semi-strong and weak-form failures), showing conceptual understanding of information incorporation.

The combination of Discover (question), Implement (empirical methods), and Reflect (interpretation) shows comprehensive treatment beyond a basic mention, meriting PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student implemented a full event-study workflow (market beta estimation via CAPM, abnormal/CAR calculation, and statistical testing) and interpreted the results, demonstrating applied understanding of event-study methodology. While granular procedural details (estimation window, significance levels) are not narrated, the implemented steps and interpretation satisfy the moderate standard for a thorough, applied treatment, so PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the market-efficiency testing problem, stated the research objective, and described the data and event window to be used, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration.

That explicit definition plus a stated approach meets the strict requirement for this DRIVER stage, so PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a concrete, explicit plan (event windows, model equation, target benchmark, and data source), satisfying the strict requirement for the Represent stage. This level of methodological clarity is sufficient for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission demonstrates a systematic implementation workflow—planning, data acquisition, calculation of abnormal returns, visualization, and significance testing—and applies the results to interpret market efficiency.

This merits PARTIAL under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies core event-study elements (event window, market model, abnormal returns, and a significance test) showing practical understanding, but treatment is basic and omits important methodological detail (estimation window/period, CAR calculation and standardization, robustness checks). Under the moderate standard this merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and tests information incorporation (event study, abnormal returns, significance testing) and reports evidence of slow incorporation (post-announcement drift).
