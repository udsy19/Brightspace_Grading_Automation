# Session 1: Financial Statements - The Language of Business

*Learning to read the story that every company tells.*

---

## Section 1: The Financial Hook - The \$50 Million Mystery

In 2019, a young analyst at a hedge fund noticed something odd. WeWork, the hottest startup in Silicon Valley, was valued at \$47 billion. SoftBank had just invested billions more. Everyone was talking about the "future of work."

But when she actually read WeWork's financial statements (filed for their planned IPO), she discovered:
- Revenues: \$1.8 billion
- Losses: \$1.9 billion
- Cash burn: \$2.2 billion per year

Within weeks, the IPO was pulled. The valuation collapsed to \$8 billion. The CEO resigned. Thousands lost their jobs.

**The difference between hype and reality? The ability to read financial statements.**

**What You'll Discover Today:**
```
The Three Windows Into Any Business:
📊 Income Statement -----> "Are we making money?"
📊 Balance Sheet --------> "What do we own and owe?"
📊 Cash Flow Statement --> "Where's the actual cash?"

Master these three documents, and you'll see through
any company's story to the truth underneath.
```

This isn't about becoming an accountant. It's about developing X-ray vision for business.

## Section 2: Foundational Financial Concepts & Models

### Part I: The Business Storytelling System

Think of financial statements as a company's vital signs—like a doctor checking pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. Each statement answers a critical question:

**The Three Core Financial Statements:**

1. **Income Statement** (also called P&L - Profit & Loss)
   - **The Performance Story**: "How well did we do?"
   - Time period: Usually a quarter or year
   - Shows: Revenue → Expenses → Profit (or Loss)
   - Like: Your monthly credit card statement

2. **Balance Sheet** (also called Statement of Financial Position)
   - **The Snapshot Story**: "What's our situation right now?"
   - Point in time: Specific date
   - Shows: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
   - Like: Your net worth statement

3. **Cash Flow Statement**
   - **The Movement Story**: "How did cash actually move?"
   - Time period: Usually matches Income Statement
   - Shows: Cash from Operations + Investing + Financing
   - Like: Your bank account activity

### Part II: The Income Statement - Keeping Score

**The Basic Flow:**
```
Revenue (Money from customers)
  ↓
- Cost of Goods Sold (Direct costs)
  ↓
= Gross Profit (What's left after direct costs)
  ↓
- Operating Expenses (Overhead: rent, salaries, etc.)
  ↓
= Operating Income (Profit from core business)
  ↓
- Interest & Taxes
  ↓
= Net Income (The "bottom line")
```

**Real Example - Coffee Shop:**
- Sell 100 coffees at \$5 each = \$500 Revenue
- Coffee beans, cups, milk = \$150 COGS
- Gross Profit = \$350 (70% margin - not bad!)
- Rent, wages, utilities = \$200 Operating Expenses
- Operating Income = \$150
- Interest on loan = \$20, Taxes = \$30
- Net Income = \$100 (20% net margin)

### Part III: The Balance Sheet - What You Have vs. What You Owe

**The Universal Equation:**
$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$

Or in plain English:
$$\text{What You Have} = \text{What You Owe} + \text{What's Left for Owners}$$

**Think of it like buying a house:**
- House value (Asset): \$500,000
- Mortgage (Liability): \$400,000
- Your equity: \$100,000

**Business Example:**
```
ASSETS (What we own)          LIABILITIES (What we owe)
Cash: \$50,000                  Accounts Payable: \$30,000
Inventory: \$100,000            Bank Loan: \$200,000
Equipment: \$200,000            Total Liabilities: \$230,000
Building: \$500,000             
                               EQUITY (Owners' stake)
                               Stock: \$100,000
                               Retained Earnings: \$520,000
                               Total Equity: \$620,000
Total Assets: \$850,000         Total L + E: \$850,000
```

### Part IV: The Cash Flow Statement - Show Me the Money

**The Three Buckets of Cash Flow:**

1. **Operating Activities** (Core business)
   - Cash from customers
   - Cash to suppliers and employees
   - *This should be positive for healthy companies*

2. **Investing Activities** (Building for future)
   - Buying equipment or buildings (negative)
   - Selling assets (positive)
   - *Usually negative for growing companies*

3. **Financing Activities** (Funding the business)
   - Borrowing money or issuing stock (positive)
   - Paying back loans or dividends (negative)
   - *Varies based on company stage*

**The Critical Insight**: You can be profitable on paper but run out of cash!

**🎯 AI Learning Support - Making Connections**

**Learning Goal:** See how business decisions appear across all three statements.

**Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I want to trace what happens when a coffee shop buys a \$10,000 espresso machine with cash. My understanding: Balance Sheet shows -\$10,000 cash and +\$10,000 equipment so assets stay the same. Cash Flow Statement shows -\$10,000 in investing activities. Income Statement shows nothing immediately but will show depreciation expense over time. Is my thinking correct? What am I missing?"*

**🛠️ Builder's Mindset:**
- ✅ **Specific scenario**: Concrete example to analyze
- ✅ **Shows reasoning**: Demonstrates thought process
- ✅ **Seeks validation**: Wants to confirm understanding
- ✅ **Asks for gaps**: Open to learning more

**😞 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"Explain all three financial statements to me."*

**💤 Copy-Paste Mentality:**
- ❌ **No vision**: What kind of dashboard?
- ❌ **No effort**: Expects complete solution
- ❌ **No learning**: Won't understand the code
- ❌ **No customization**: Generic is useless

**🎯 Your Challenge:** Create a prompt about a business transaction you're curious about (hiring employees, taking a loan, etc.) and trace its impact.

## Section 3: The Financial Gym - Partner Practice & AI Copilot Learning

### Round 1: Financial Statement Scavenger Hunt

**Solo Activity (10 minutes)**

Using this simplified tech startup data, answer these questions:

```python
# TechStartup Inc. - Year 1 Summary
income_statement = {
    'revenue': 1000000,  # \$1M in sales
    'cogs': 300000,      # Cost of goods sold
    'salaries': 500000,  # Employee costs
    'rent': 100000,      # Office rent
    'marketing': 200000, # Advertising
    'interest': 50000    # Loan interest
}

balance_sheet = {
    'cash': 200000,
    'accounts_receivable': 150000,  # Customer IOUs
    'equipment': 300000,
    'total_liabilities': 400000,
    'equity': 250000
}

cash_flow = {
    'operating_cf': -80000,   # Negative!
    'investing_cf': -300000,  # Bought equipment
    'financing_cf': 500000    # Raised money
}
```

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Is the company profitable? (Calculate net income)
2. Despite being profitable/unprofitable, why is operating cash flow negative?
3. How did they afford to buy \$300,000 of equipment?
4. What's their burn rate if this continues?

> **Burn Rate:** Burn rate is how quickly a company is spending its cash reserves each month, usually by comparing how much more money goes out than comes in from running the business.
>
> Most of the time, when people talk about burn rate, they mean the “operating burn rate”—how much cash the company is losing from its core business activities (ignoring cash from new loans or investments). Sometimes, people include all cash flows (operating, investing, and financing), but for understanding how long a company can survive without new funding, it’s best to focus on operating burn rate.
>
> **Example:**  
> Imagine a startup with these cash flows for the year:
> - Operating cash flow: **–\$80,000** (the business lost \$80,000 from its normal activities)
> - Investing cash flow: **–\$300,000** (the company bought equipment)
> - Financing cash flow: **+\$500,000** (the company raised money from investors)
>
> The **operating burn rate** is \$80,000 per year, or about \$6,667 per month. This tells you how much the business is losing each month from its normal operations.
>
> If the company started with \$200,000 in cash and keeps losing \$6,667 per month, it would run out of money in about 30 months—unless it raises more money or becomes profitable. This “time left” is called the **cash runway**.
>
> **Note:** If you include investing and financing, the net cash flow is positive (because of the money raised), but that doesn’t reflect the ongoing **business health**.

### Round 2: AI Copilot Learning Phase

**📚 AI Learning Support - Pattern Recognition**

**Learning Goal:** Spot healthy vs. concerning patterns in financial statements.

**Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm looking at a startup with \$1M revenue, -\$150K net income, and -\$80K operating cash flow. The difference between loss and cash flow seems to be from \$150K in accounts receivable. This suggests they're selling but not collecting cash quickly. What other patterns should I look for to determine if this is a normal growth company issue or a red flag?"*

**💼 Investment-Ready Analysis:**
- ✅ **Specific numbers**: Shows real analysis
- ✅ **Identifies pattern**: Sees the AR issue
- ✅ **Seeks context**: Knows patterns need interpretation
- ✅ **Risk awareness**: Looking for red flags

**🚩 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"Is this company good or bad?"*

**🛑 Amateur Hour:**
- ❌ **No data**: Provides no context
- ❌ **Binary thinking**: Business isn't black/white
- ❌ **Lazy question**: No analytical effort
- ❌ **Useless answer**: Will get useless response

**🎯 Your Mission:** Write a prompt that helps you understand what healthy vs. concerning cash burn looks like for different types of companies.

### Round 3: Partner Teaching Exercise

**The Story Behind the Numbers**

Partner A: Pick one of these business events:
1. "We just landed a huge \$500K contract"
2. "We bought out our competitor"
3. "We raised \$2M from investors"
4. "We're giving all employees a 20% raise"

Partner B: Explain what happens to each financial statement

**Example for "Landed \$500K contract":**
- Income Statement: +\$500K revenue (when work is done)
- Balance Sheet: +\$500K accounts receivable, then converts to cash
- Cash Flow: Nothing until customer actually pays

### Round 4: Build Your Financial Dashboard

**🏗️ AI Learning Support - Building Analysis Tools**

**Learning Goal:** Create practical tools for financial analysis.

**Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I built a financial health dashboard that goes beyond basic ratios. I'm thinking of including: 1) Burn rate calculator for startups, 2) Working capital trends, 3) Quality of earnings score.

    print("=" * 30)
    print(f"Profitability: {profit_status} ({profit_margin:.1%} margin)")
    print(f"Cash Flow: {cf_status}")
    print(f"Liquidity: {liquidity_status}")
    if runway_months != float('inf'):
        print(f"Runway: {runway_months:.1f} months at current burn rate")
    else:
        print(f"Runway: Infinite (cash flow positive)")

# Test with our TechStartup data
revenue = 1000000
net_income = revenue - 300000 - 500000 - 100000 - 200000 - 50000  # -150000
operating_cf = -80000
cash = 200000
liabilities = 400000

financial_health_check(revenue, net_income, operating_cf, cash, liabilities)
```

**🔧 AI Learning Support - Code Enhancement**

### **E - Evolve**

**Take It Further**

Your analysis can evolve to include:
1. **Ratio Analysis**: Turn raw statement data into comparable metrics (see below)
2. **Cohort Analysis**: Track user retention over time
3. **LTV/CAC Ratios**: Lifetime value vs. acquisition cost
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Market share trends
5. **Scenario Modeling**: Best/base/worst cases
6. **Exit Analysis**: Potential acquisition values

**Common Financial Ratios to Explore**

Calculate at least these five ratios (and feel free to add others that interest you):
1. **ROA (Return on Assets)** = Net Income / Total Assets
2. **ROE (Return on Equity)** = Net Income / Total Equity
3. **Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue
4. **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
5. **EPS (Earnings Per Share)** = Net Income / Shares Outstanding

These provide a foundation, but don't let them limit your exploration.

### DRIVER Framework Requirement

**DRIVER is your analytical work process, not a documentation format.**

You must use DRIVER to conduct your analysis, not to describe completed work retrospectively. This means beginning your analytical work with the Define & Discover stage and completing both D and R stages before proceeding to implementation.

**Work Process Requirements:**
- Begin your analytical work with the Define & Discover stage
- Complete the Represent stage to plan your analytical approach
- Proceed to Implementation only after D and R stages are documented
- Document your process as you work through each stage sequentially

**Submission Requirements:**

All submissions must include:

1. **DRIVER Analysis Document** demonstrating sequential stage completion
2. **Video presentation** covering all six DRIVER stages in order: D → R → I → V → E → R
3. **Code repository** with executable analysis

Your documentation must reflect chronological progression through the analytical process, not retrospective justification of completed work.

**Critical Requirement:** Assignments submitted without adequate Define & Discover stage documentation completed before implementation will receive a grade of zero without further evaluation.

Refer to **DRIVER Framework: Assignment Guidelines** for complete requirements and grading criteria.

## Section 7: Looking Ahead - From Understanding Statements to Using Time Value

### You've Built These Skills:

✓ **Financial Literacy**: You can read all three statements
✓ **Pattern Recognition**: You spot healthy vs. concerning trends
✓ **Cash Flow Awareness**: You know profit doesn't equal cash
✓ **Analysis Tools**: You can build basic financial dashboards
✓ **Critical Thinking**: You question the numbers

### Next Session Preview: The Time Value of Money

Now that you can read financial statements, you're ready to learn finance's most powerful concept: money today is worth more than money tomorrow.

In Session 2, you'll discover:
- Why a dollar today > a dollar tomorrow
- How to compare cash flows across time
- The math that powers every financial decision
- Tools used by every finance professional

The financial statements you just mastered provide the cash flow forecasts. Time Value of Money tells you what those cash flows are actually worth.

### Pre-Session 2 Challenge

Think about these questions:
1. Would you rather have \$1,000 today or \$1,100 in one year?
2. What if it was \$1,000 today or \$2,000 in one year?
3. At what point would you switch your preference?

Your answer reveals your personal "discount rate"—a concept that drives trillions in financial decisions.


**Round 1 Solutions:**

```python
# Question 1: Is the company profitable?
revenue = 1000000
total_expenses = 300000 + 500000 + 100000 + 200000 + 50000
net_income = revenue - total_expenses
print(f"Net Income: \${net_income}")  # -\$150,000 - NOT profitable

# Question 2: Why negative operating cash flow?
# Despite \$150K loss, operating CF is only -\$80K
# Difference of \$70K likely from:
# - Accounts receivable increase (sold but not collected)
# - Depreciation (non-cash expense)
# - Accounts payable increase (bought but not paid)

# Question 3: How afford equipment?
# Financing CF of \$500K (raised money from investors/loans)
# This covered operating loss (\$80K) and equipment (\$300K)

# Question 4: Burn rate
monthly_burn = 80000 / 12  # \$6,667 per month
runway = 200000 / monthly_burn  # 30 months of runway
```
