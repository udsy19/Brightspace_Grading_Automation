# Mini-Project 1: Ship Something Using DRIVER Loops

*Your first taste of building in an AI-powered world*

---

## The Assignment

Build a simple finance tool that works on the internet. Use DRIVER in loops to go from crappy to better. It should apply something you learned from Sessions 1 or 2.

**Timeline:** One week from Session 2

**Why This Matters:** In 2025, financial analysts who can't build are becoming extinct. This isn't about becoming a programmer. It's about proving you can create value in a world where AI does the analysis and humans do the building. Plus, you'll actually USE the finance concepts you're learning.

## The DRIVER Loop Approach

### Loop 1: Just Make It Exist

**D - Discover**: What's one tiny finance thing that would be useful to build?
- Pick ONE concept from Session 1 or 2
- Examples based on what you've learned:
  - **Session 1 Ideas**: Quick ratio calculator, burn rate calculator, revenue growth checker
  - **Session 2 Ideas**: Loan payment calculator, compound interest visualizer, "how long to double my money?"

**R - Reason**: What's the absolute simplest version?
- One calculation? One input box? One result?
- How can I build this in under an hour?

**I - Implement**: Build the crappiest version that works
- Use Replit.com (or whatever you find)
- Ask AI for help constantly
- Copy-paste is fine - just make it work

**V - Verify**: Does it do ONE thing?
- Can you click/type something and get a result?
- Record a short screen-capture video demo showing it working; no live deploy or share link required

**E - Evolve**: What's obviously broken or missing?
- Pick ONE thing to improve next

**R - Reflect**: What was harder/easier than expected?

### Loop 2: Make It Less Crappy

Run through DRIVER again:
- **D**: What annoys users most about version 1?
- **R**: What's the smallest fix with biggest impact?
- **I**: Implement that ONE improvement
- **V**: Is it actually better?
- **E**: What's next?
- **R**: What did I learn about improving things?

### Loop 3+: Keep Improving

Keep looping until you're proud of it (or time runs out)

## Tools & Resources

**Recommended Starting Point:** 
- Replit.com - sign up free, start building immediately
- Everything runs in browser; if live deploy isn't available on the free tier, that's fine — you'll submit a video demo

**Research These Yourself Using AI:**
- "How to build a simple calculator web app with Replit"
- "JavaScript code for compound interest formula"
- "How to make a financial calculator in HTML and JavaScript"
- "Simple loan payment calculator tutorial"
- "How to format currency in JavaScript"

**Other Options to Explore:**
- v0.dev (Vercel) - describe UI in plain English
- Claude Artifacts - build in the chat
- ChatGPT Canvas - interactive coding
- Whatever you discover!

## Finance Tool Ideas (Based on Sessions 1 & 2)

### Session 1 (Financial Statements) Ideas:

**Super Simple Starters:**
- **Quick Ratio Calculator**: Enter current assets and liabilities → Get ratio
- **Burn Rate Timer**: Enter cash and monthly burn → Shows "months until $0"
- **Profit Margin Checker**: Revenue and net income → Shows margin percentage
- **Working Capital Calculator**: Just subtracts current liabilities from current assets

**Slightly More Advanced (Loop 2+):**
- **Startup Runway Calculator**: Cash, burn rate, revenue growth → Interactive timeline
- **Financial Health Checker**: Enter 5 key numbers → Get "healthy/warning/danger" rating
- **YoY Growth Visualizer**: Enter this year and last year → See growth percentage with colors

### Session 2 (Time Value of Money) Ideas:

**Super Simple Starters:**
- **Rule of 72 Calculator**: Enter interest rate → Shows years to double
- **Present Value Calculator**: Future amount, rate, years → Today's value
- **Loan Payment Calculator**: Amount, rate, years → Monthly payment
- **Compound Interest Visualizer**: Shows money growing over time

**Slightly More Advanced (Loop 2+):**
- **"Can I Afford This?" Tool**: Price, down payment, income → Yes/No with explanation
- **Student Loan vs Investment Calculator**: Compare paying off loans vs investing
- **Retirement Calculator (Simple)**: Current age, retirement age, monthly savings → Final amount

## Examples of What Others Built

**Loop 1 Examples (Gloriously Crappy but Working):**
- Quick ratio calculator with just 2 input boxes
- "Days until broke" counter for startups (just divides cash by daily burn)
- Compound interest calculator that only works for $1000
- Loan payment calculator that assumes 30 years

**After 3-4 Loops:**
- Financial ratio dashboard that color-codes results
- Interactive compound interest graph
- Loan comparison tool with amortization schedule
- Startup runway calculator with "what-if" scenarios

## Requirements

1. **Two Versions Minimum**
   - Explain how you updated your app from the starting version to the better version
   - Only the final needs to be discussed in the video

2. **Submission (Video Demo Only)**
   - Submit a screen-capture video demonstrating your final version and briefly how it improved from Loop 1.
   - No code repository required.
   - No live app link required (free-tier friendly).
   - Submit your video per the course syllabus instructions via Brightspace.

3. **Brief Reflection** (Discuss in your video)
   - Loop 1: What I built and what I learned (3-4 sentences)
   - Loop 2: What I improved and why (3-4 sentences)
   - Overall: Biggest surprise about building with AI (2-3 sentences)

---

### GRADING CRITERIA (For Instructor Reference Only):

- **Ship a working web finance tool:** 60%
- **Demonstrate iterative improvement using DRIVER loops:** 25%
- **Clear video demo that shows the final version and explains improvements:** 10%
- **Reflection quality:** 5%

## Tips for Success

**What Usually Goes Wrong:**
- Trying to build something too complex → Start stupidly simple
- Perfectionism → Ship the crappy version FIRST
- Picking tools that need setup → Use Replit or similar

**The Mental Model:**
- This isn't a coding assignment
- It's a "figure out how to build things" assignment
- The building is the point, not the product

## FAQ

**Q: Does it have to be finance-related?**
A: Yes! Pick something from Session 1 (financial statements) or Session 2 (time value of money). This reinforces what you're learning.

**Q: What if I've never coded before?**
A: Perfect. Neither had most builders before they built their first thing. AI will help. Start with the simplest calculator possible.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**
A: For this first project, try it solo. You need to know YOU can build.

**Q: What if my idea already exists?**
A: Everything already exists. Build YOUR version anyway. Make it simpler, clearer, or just different.

**Q: Can I just copy the Python code from class?**
A: No - build an interactive interface (buttons/inputs) that runs in your environment (e.g., Replit). A public deploy is not required; you'll demonstrate via video. You can use the formulas!

**Q: How do I know when to stop improving?**
A: When the deadline hits or you're proud of it - whichever comes first.

## The Real Goal

After this project, you should believe: "I can build things."

Not perfect things. Not complex things. But things that work.

That belief changes everything.

**Why?** Because in your finance career:
- Analysts who can prototype tools will lead teams
- Those who only use tools will report to them
- The question isn't "Can you analyze?" (AI does that)
- It's "Can you create solutions?" (Only humans do that)

**Start now. Start crappy. Start shipping.**

Your survival depends on it.
