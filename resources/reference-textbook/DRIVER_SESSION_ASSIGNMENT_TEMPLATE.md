# Session Assignment Template

## Section 5: Assignment - [Session-Specific Title]

### Assignment Overview

[1-2 paragraphs describing the specific business problem or analytical task for this session]

[Example for Session 1:]
Analyze the financial health of one publicly traded company selected from the following: Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), or Procter & Gamble (PG). Your analysis must employ the three core financial statements to assess company performance, financial position, and cash generation capability.

### DRIVER Framework Requirement

**DRIVER is your analytical work process, not a documentation format.**

You must use DRIVER to conduct your analysis, not to describe completed work retrospectively. This means beginning your analytical work with the Define & Discover stage and completing both D and R stages before proceeding to implementation.

**Work Process Requirements:**
- Begin your analytical work with the Define & Discover stage
- Complete the Represent stage to plan your analytical approach
- Proceed to Implementation only after D and R stages are documented
- Document your process as you work through each stage sequentially

**Submission Requirements:**

All submissions must include:

1. **DRIVER Analysis Document** demonstrating sequential stage completion
2. **Video presentation** covering all six DRIVER stages in order: D → R → I → V → E → R
3. **Code repository** with executable analysis

Your documentation must reflect chronological progression through the analytical process, not retrospective justification of completed work.

**Critical Requirement:** Assignments submitted without adequate Define & Discover stage documentation completed before implementation will receive a grade of zero without further evaluation.

Refer to **DRIVER Framework: Assignment Guidelines** for complete requirements and grading criteria.

### Assessment

Your work will be evaluated according to the grading structure specified in **DRIVER Framework: Assignment Guidelines**:

**Total: 100 points**

#### 1. Financial Concepts Accuracy (50 points)

**[SESSION-SPECIFIC CONCEPTS - REPLACE THIS SECTION]**

Your understanding will be assessed on the following session-specific financial concepts:

[Example for Session 1 - Financial Statements:]

- Profitability metrics (ROA, ROE, Profit Margin)
- Liquidity and solvency assessment
- Year-over-year trend analysis

[Example for Session 7 - CAPM:]
- CAPM concept and theory
- CAPM parameters (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium)
- Beta interpretation and calculation
- Risk and return relationship
- Systematic vs. unsystematic risk
- Security Market Line (SML)

[Example for Session 2 - Time Value of Money:]
- Time value of money principle
- Present value and future value concepts
- Discount rates and compounding
- Annuities and perpetuities
- Cash flow timing and valuation

#### 2. Technical Implementation (10 points)

- Code organization and documentation

#### 3. Integration of Finance and Technology (20 points)
- Automation enhances financial analysis
- Data-driven insights beyond basic calculations
- Appropriate visualization of financial relationships
- Demonstrates understanding of technology's role in finance

#### 4. Following the DRIVER Framework (10 points)
- Define & Discover: Clear problem understanding completed before implementation
- Represent: Quality logic mapping and planning
- Implement: Systematic execution

### Data Sources

[Session-specific data source guidance]

[Example for Session 1:]
Financial statement data may be obtained from:
- Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com)
- SEC EDGAR database (sec.gov/edgar)
- Company investor relations websites
- Financial data APIs (e.g., yfinance Python library)

Verify data accuracy by cross-referencing multiple sources.
