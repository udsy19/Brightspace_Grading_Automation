## Section 5: Assignment - Time Value of Money Analysis

### Your Mission

Explore how money moves through time by analyzing a real financial decision you or someone you know might face:
- **Retirement savings** decision: You're a financial advisor helping a client plan for retirement.Your client just graduate from university and is 22 years old, making \$65,000 per year. He plans to retire at age 65 and wants to save 30% of his income at every year end. You expect the inflation rate to be 2% per year and the interest rate to be 5% per year. You also expect his salary to increase by 3% per year. You suggest him to invest 60% of his saving in stocks and 40% in bonds. You expect the stock to return 8% per year and the bond to return 4% per year. 

What would be the total amount of money he would have at age 65? What is the present value of this amount? What alternative plan would you suggest and why (with numbers to justify your suggestion)? He also thinks that he might be able to put about \$1,000 more at the end of every year. How would this affect the total amount of money he would have at age 65?

### Approach: The DRIVER Framework

Use DRIVER to guide your exploration, but let the problem shape your approach.

#### Using DRIVER to Guide Your Analysis

**Define & Discover:** What's the financial decision? What information do you need to gather?

**Represent:** Sketch out the cash flows on a timeline before coding.

**Implement:** Build your analysis, explaining both the financial logic and your code.

**Validate:** Check your results with online calculators or financial websites.

**Evolve:** How could this analysis extend to more complex scenarios?

**Reflect:** What surprised you about how time affects value?

### What You'll Create

1. **A video** sharing your analysis journey (take the time you need to explain well)
2. **Your Python notebook** showing your work
3. **A transcript** of your video
4. **Any additional materials** your instructor requests

### Video Guidelines

Your video should demonstrate your understanding:
- Show you understand the concepts - that's what matters
- Walk through your logic clearly
- Explain it like teaching a friend who's new to finance
- Show your working code and explain what it does
- Demonstrate how you verified your results
- Share what you learned - the "aha" moments that clicked for you

---

### AI Collaboration

Use AI as you would any resource - to enhance your understanding and check your work. The most valuable learning comes from wrestling with the concepts yourself first.

---

### Core Concepts to Explore

Consider these fundamental ideas (explore what interests you most):
- **Present Value vs Future Value**
- **Compound interest effects**
- **Discount rates and opportunity cost**
- **Payment streams (annuities)**
- **Real vs nominal returns**

These are starting points - follow your curiosity deeper.

### A Note on Learning

You're building the foundation for all financial analysis. Every investment decision, every loan evaluation, every financial plan ultimately comes down to understanding how money moves through time.

Focus on understanding the "why" behind the calculations. When you truly grasp time value of money, the rest of finance becomes much clearer.

**Remember: Finance is just math applied to money over time. Master this, and you master the language of finance.**
