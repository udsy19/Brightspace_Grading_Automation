# Mini-Project 2: Build a Basic AI Finance Tool (n8n or similar)

From "I can build" to "I can build an intelligent finance helper"

---

## The Assignment

Use n8n or a similar automation/AI workflow platform (e.g., Make, Zapier, Pipedream, Flowise/LangFlow) to build a very basic AI-powered finance or personal finance tool. Keep it simple. Make it useful.

**Timeline:** One week from Session 6

**Submission:** No public link required. Present your tool via a short screen-recorded demo in your video assignment (show the n8n workflow and the tool output).

**Note:** You will need to sign up for a paid AI API key (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)

**Don't know how?** Research how to get an AI API key together with your AI copilot!

## The Evolution

**Mini-Project 1:** You built something (anything!) and learned you CAN build
**Mini-Project 2:** Now build a simple AI tool that helps with finance (in n8n or similar)

---

## n8n Quick Start (recommended)

1. Create a free n8n Cloud account or run n8n locally.
2. Add three nodes: Trigger/Input → AI (LLM) → Output.
3. Write a simple prompt that maps your inputs to finance guidance (e.g., "Given income and expenses, suggest 2 budget tips and a next step").
4. Test with real numbers and iterate once.
5. Screen-record a short demo; no public link required.

## DRIVER Loops for Finance Tools

### Loop 1: Pick a Pain Point

**D - Discover**: What financial calculation annoys you?

- Something from Sessions 1-5 that's tedious to calculate
- Something you wish you had when doing homework
- Something your non-finance friends always ask about

**Examples to Spark Ideas:**

- "How much will my investment be worth?"
- "What loan can I afford?"
- "Should I buy or rent?"
- "What's my real return after inflation?"
- "How risky is my portfolio?"

**R - Reason**: What's the simplest helpful version?

- Start with ONE calculation
- Make it user-friendly and accessible
- Explain it clearly with practical context

**I - Implement**: Build the basic n8n workflow

- Trigger/Input → AI (LLM) node → Output (text/markdown)
- Add explanation in plain English
- (Optional) Simple input form/fields; friendly output
- Keep prompts short and specific to the finance task

**V - Verify**: Would YOU actually use this?

- Test with real numbers
- Test with a classmate (screen share or in person; no public link required)
- Is it faster than doing it manually?

**E - Evolve**: What would make it 2x more useful?

**R - Reflect**: What did building teach you about this concept?

### Loop 2: Make It Actually Helpful

Common improvements:

- Add "explain this result" feature
- Handle edge cases (negative values, zeros)
- Save/share results
- Add visualization (charts make finance clearer)
- Multiple scenarios comparison

### Loop 3+: Make It Stand Out

What would make someone bookmark this?

## Technical Growth

You already know you can build. Now level up:

**New Skills to Try (Pick One):**

- Pull real data (stock prices, interest rates)
- Add a simple chart/graph
- Make calculations update live
- Store user preferences
- Make it look professional

**Ask AI:**

- "How do I add a chart to my web app?"
- "How do I fetch current interest rates?"
- "How do I make my calculator look professional?"
- "How do I save user data locally?"

---

## Requirements

1. **Core AI Functionality (n8n or similar)**
   - Built in n8n or a similar platform using at least one LLM node (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or local like Ollama)
   - Solves a finance or personal finance problem/question
   - Explains results in plain English (show the "why," not just the number)
   - No public link required; keep API keys private

2. **Two Versions**
   - Loop 1: Basic working AI workflow
   - Loop 2+: Enhance with one major improvement (e.g., prompt refinement, validation, nicer formatting)

3. **Submission: Video Demo**
   - 60–120 seconds screen recording showing the n8n nodes, prompt, and output
   - One example input → output; explain who would use it and why
   - Do NOT include or expose API keys in your recording

## Assessment

**Pass Criteria:**

- It calculates something finance-related correctly ✓
- Someone would choose it over manual calculation ✓
- You improved it based on feedback ✓
- You can explain the finance concept it demonstrates ✓

**Bonus Recognition:**

- Pulls real-time data
- Genuinely useful (classmates ask to try it or request a demo)
- Teaches the concept while calculating
- Creative approach to common problem

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Too Complex:** "I'll build a full Bloomberg Terminal"
→ Build ONE useful feature first

**Too Simple:** "It just adds two numbers"
→ What financial decision does this help with?

**No Context:** "Here's your answer: 42,389.12"
→ Explain what this number means

---

## The Mindset Shift

**Mini-Project 1:** "I can build things"
**Mini-Project 2:** "I can build things that matter"

After this, you'll see every financial formula as a potential tool you could build.

**The Career Reality:** Every financial model, every analysis, every report will soon have AI assistance. The differentiator? Who can build the tools that make finance accessible, automated, and actionable. That's you, after this project.

---

## Start With These Questions

1. What financial calculation do you hate doing manually?
2. What do your friends always ask you to calculate?
3. What concept from class would be clearer with interaction?
4. What would have helped you in Sessions 1-5?

Pick one. Build it. Make it better.

**Remember: Simple and useful beats complex and ambitious.**

Ship something that helps someone (maybe just you) make a better financial decision.
