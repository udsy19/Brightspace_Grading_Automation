## Section 5: Assignment - Real Company Financial Analysis

### Your Mission

Explore the financial health of ONE established company:
- **Coca-Cola (KO)** - Beverage company everyone knows
- **Walmart (WMT)** - Retail giant with simple business model  
- **Procter & Gamble (PG)** - Consumer goods (Tide, Gillette, Pampers)

These companies have clear business models and accessible financial data, making them ideal for your first analysis.

### Approach: The DRIVER Framework

Use **DRIVER** to structure your exploration, but let your curiosity guide the depth and direction of your analysis.

#### Using DRIVER to Guide Your Analysis

**Define & Discover:** Start by clarifying what your goal is and what you're trying to learn and taking stock of what you know versus what you need to figure out.

**Represent:** Sketch out your approach before diving into code - even a simple flowchart **helps clarify thinking**.
- ✅ **Simple flowchart**:
- - Step 1: Data Collection: Find the company's financial statements on Yahoo Finance or other financial websites such as Ask Gemini or Google Search "financial websites where I can download financial statements"
- - Step 2: Data Validation: Check if the data is correct and complete
- - Step 3: Data Cleaning: Clean the data to make it ready for analysis
- - Step 4: Data Analysis: Analyze the data to make sense of it. Use financial ratios to analyze the data.
- - - Year over Year (YOY) Analysis: Compare the data from one year to the next to see if the company is impproving over time.
- - Step 5: Data Visualization (optional for now): Visualize the data to make it easier to understand

**Implement:** Build your analysis, explaining your financial and technical thinking as you go.

**Validate:** Compare your calculated ratios and results with financial websites and explore any differences you find.

**Evolve:** Consider how this analysis could extend to other companies or questions.

**Reflect:** What surprised you? What was harder or easier than expected? What would you do differently?

### What You'll Create

1. **A video** sharing your analysis journey (7-10 minutes is typical, but take the time you need)
2. **Your Python notebook** (Google Colab) showing your work
3. **A transcript** of your video
4. **Any additional materials** your instructor requests

Your video should demonstrate your understanding:
- Show you understand the concepts - that's what matters
- Walk through your logic clearly
- Explain it like teaching a friend who's new to finance
- Show your working code and explain what it does
- Demonstrate how you verified your results
- Share what you learned - the "aha" moments that clicked for you

### Assessment Approach

Your instructor will evaluate your work based on:
- Understanding of financial concepts
- Technical implementation
- Integration of finance and technology
- Following the DRIVER framework
- Clear communication and explanation

Specific grading criteria will be determined by your instructor.

### AI Collaboration

Remember: AI is one of many resources available to you. Use it thoughtfully as you would any tool - to enhance your understanding, not replace your thinking.

The most valuable learning often comes from wrestling with problems.

The rewards of persistence and smart work are immeasurable.

### Core Financial Ratios to Explore

Calculate at least these five ratios (and feel free to add others that interest you):
1. **ROA (Return on Assets)** = Net Income / Total Assets
2. **ROE (Return on Equity)** = Net Income / Total Equity
3. **Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue
4. **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
5. **EPS (Earnings Per Share)** = Net Income / Shares Outstanding

These provide a foundation, but don't let them limit your exploration.

### A Note on Learning

Through this assignment, you're developing many capabilities simultaneously - some you'll notice immediately, others will emerge over time. Every struggle, breakthrough, and "aha" moment is part of your growth.

Focus on building your understanding and finding your own way to explain these concepts. There's no single "right" approach - what matters is that you engage deeply with the material and make it your own.

**Welcome to the journey of becoming a financial analyst in the AI era! You will DRIVE the AI for sure!**
