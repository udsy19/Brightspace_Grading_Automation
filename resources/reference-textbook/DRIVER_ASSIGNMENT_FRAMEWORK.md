# DRIVER Framework: Assignment Guidelines

## Purpose and Rationale

The DRIVER framework (Define & Discover, Represent, Implement, Verify, Evolve, Reflect) structures the professional decision-making methodology used in financial analysis. This framework is not pedagogical scaffolding but rather the systematic approach employed by financial professionals when addressing ambiguous business problems.

Each assignment in this textbook requires complete application of the DRIVER framework. This requirement is non-negotiable and central to your development as a financial analyst.

## Grading Structure

**Total: 100 points**

### 1. Financial Concepts Accuracy (50 points)

**PRIMARY FOCUS: Understanding of Session-Specific Financial Knowledge**

Each assignment will specify 5-8 specific financial concepts, theories, parameters, and principles that students must demonstrate mastery of. These vary by session topic and are clearly listed in each assignment.

**Examples of Session-Specific Concepts:**
- *CAPM Session*: CAPM theory, beta calculation, risk-free rate, market risk premium, systematic vs. unsystematic risk, Security Market Line
- *TVM Session*: Time value of money principle, present/future value, discount rates, annuities, cash flow timing
- *Capital Budgeting Session*: NPV concept, IRR, WACC application, project risk assessment, capital allocation decisions

**Grading Guidance:**
- **45-50 points**: Deep understanding of all core concepts with ability to explain theoretical foundations and practical applications. Makes sophisticated connections between concepts.
- **40-44 points**: Solid grasp of major concepts with minor gaps. Can apply theories correctly but may lack depth in explaining underlying principles.
- **35-39 points**: Understands basic concepts but has significant gaps or misconceptions. Application is mechanical rather than conceptual.
- **Below 35**: Major conceptual errors or inability to explain core financial principles.

**Critical Gate:** If financial concepts understanding is below 35 points (70%), the assignment may receive additional scrutiny and students may be asked to revise or explain their work.

- **Below 12**: Minimal integration or technology doesn't enhance analysis

---

### 4. Following the DRIVER Framework (10 points)

**Methodology - How thoroughly did they apply the framework?**

**Critical Requirement:** DRIVER is your analytical work process, not a documentation format. You must begin with Define & Discover stage and complete both D and R stages before proceeding to implementation.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Define & Discover** (required first): Clear problem understanding, goal setting, and knowledge gap analysis completed before implementation
- **Represent**: Quality of logic mapping, visualization, and planning (beyond minimum)
- **Implement**: Systematic execution following the planned approach
- **Validate**: Thoroughness of verification, testing, and sensitivity analysis
- **Evolve**: Thoughtful pattern recognition and extension ideas
- **Reflect**: Depth of learning insights, transferable principles, and self-awareness

**Critical Gate:** Assignments submitted without adequate Define & Discover stage documentation completed before implementation will receive a grade of zero without further evaluation.

**Grading Guidance:**
- **9-10 points**: Exemplary DRIVER application with deep engagement in all stages
- **7-8 points**: Solid DRIVER progression with meaningful work in each stage
- **5-6 points**: Basic DRIVER completion, some stages superficial
- **0-4 points**: Missing stages or retrospective DRIVER documentation

---

### 5. Clear Communication and Explanation (10 points)

**Teaching Ability - Can they explain it to others?**
- Video clearly explains the analysis journey
- Complex concepts explained simply (suitable for beginners)
- Logical flow from problem to solution
- Code is explained, not just shown
- Professional presentation quality
- Demonstrates genuine understanding through explanation

**Grading Guidance:**
- **9-10 points**: Exceptional clarity, engaging presentation, teaches effectively
- **7-8 points**: Clear communication with logical flow
- **5-6 points**: Understandable but lacks polish or clarity
- **Below 5**: Confusing, disorganized, or demonstrates lack of understanding

---

**Total: 100 points**

**Note on Grading Philosophy:**
This structure emphasizes financial concept mastery (50%) as the primary learning goal, with technical implementation and framework methodology as supporting competencies. The goal is to develop financial analysts who deeply understand financial principles and can apply them using modern technology and systematic thinking.

## Required Documentation Structure

### DRIVER Analysis Document

All assignments require a formal DRIVER Analysis Document containing the following sections:

#### Section 1: Define & Discover
- **Business Problem Statement**: Articulate the core business challenge requiring decision-making.
- **Decision Objectives**: Specify measurable outcomes defining analytical success.
- **Success Criteria**: Establish evaluation standards for decision quality.
- **Data Requirements**: Identify necessary data sources and access methods.
- **Key Assumptions**: Document assumptions underlying the analysis.
- **Research Questions**: Formulate questions requiring resolution before implementation.
- **Initial Discovery**: Summarize findings from preliminary investigation.

#### Section 2: Represent
- **Conceptual Model**: Diagram the problem structure and component relationships.
- **Analytical Framework**: Identify applicable financial models and formulas.
- **Methodological Approach**: Outline step-by-step analysis plan prior to implementation.
- **Variable Relationships**: Map connections between key analytical elements.
- **Visual Representation**: Provide flowcharts or diagrams illustrating approach.

**Required Coverage:**
1. Define & Discover stage explanation
2. Represent stage conceptual model presentation
3. Implement and Verify stages demonstration
4. Evolve stage iteration documentation
5. Reflect stage synthesis

**Standards:**
- All six DRIVER stages must be addressed explicitly
- Code must be demonstrated with screen sharing
- Explanation must demonstrate conceptual understanding
- Presentation must maintain professional standards
- Delivery must be clear and organized

Missing any DRIVER stage results in a 20-point deduction.

---

## Code Repository Requirements

**Mandatory Elements:**
- DRIVER Analysis Document (integrated or separate file)
- Executable code without errors
- Comments linking code sections to DRIVER stages
- README file explaining DRIVER application
- Documentation of data sources

---

## AI Tool Integration

AI tools may enhance learning when used to augment rather than replace analytical thinking.

**Appropriate Use:**
- Testing hypotheses through structured questioning
- Validating analytical approaches
- Debugging methodology and implementation
- Exploring alternative frameworks

**Inappropriate Use:**
- Delegating problem definition to AI
- Requesting complete solutions without student conceptualization
- Substituting AI output for original analysis
- Bypassing the thinking process

Video presentations reveal understanding authenticity. Students must be prepared to explain all aspects of their submitted work.

## Common Questions

**Q: What constitutes adequate detail in each DRIVER stage?**
A: Each stage must provide sufficient detail that an independent analyst could understand your decision-making process.

**Q: May I revise my Define & Discover stage during analysis?**
A: Yes. Document such revisions in the Evolve stage as evidence of learning.

**Q: What if implementation reveals my initial approach was flawed?**
A: This demonstrates valuable learning. Document the discovery and revision in the Evolve section.

**Q: How is DRIVER documentation timing evaluated?**
A: Authentic process documentation differs qualitatively from retrospective justification. Your documentation should reflect progressive development, not post-hoc rationalization.

---

## Academic Integrity

The DRIVER framework enhances academic integrity by requiring:
1. Original problem definition demonstrating analytical thinking
2. Process documentation revealing authentic work
3. Iterative refinement showing learning progression
4. Reflection demonstrating conceptual integration
5. Video presentation confirming understanding

Students submitting work they cannot explain in presentation demonstrate violations of academic integrity policies.

## Framework Philosophy

Professional financial analysts face ambiguous problems requiring systematic thinking. The DRIVER framework develops this capability by requiring:

- **Clarity before action** (Define before Implement)
- **Planning before execution** (Represent before Implement)
- **Validation of results** (Verify all outputs)
- **Learning from iteration** (Evolve through refinement)
- **Metacognitive development** (Reflect on process)

This framework represents transferable professional competency. Master this approach and apply it throughout your career.
