# Session 10: Capital Budgeting & Investment Decisions

*Using NPV to decide: Should we build that factory?*

---

## Section 1: The Financial Hook - The Billion-Dollar Decision

You're on Apple's capital allocation committee. Tim Cook presents a strategic decision: build a \$2 billion advanced semiconductor facility in Texas. The finance team projects:

**Project Projections:**
- **Years 1-3:** \$500M annual operating cash flows (ramp-up period)
- **Years 4-8:** \$800M annual operating cash flows (full production)
- **Years 9-10:** \$300M annual cash flows (declining technology)
- **Year 10:** \$200M facility sale value

Apple's WACC: 8.5%

**Timeline Visualization:**
```
Investment: -\$2B -----> \$500M -----> \$500M -----> \$800M -----> ... -----> \$500M
Today             Year 1      Year 2      Year 4              Year 10
    |               |           |           |                   |
    |<------------- Present Value Analysis ------------------>|
```

The strategic team argues: "We need this for supply chain independence!" The operations team counters: "We could outsource for less!" Your job: cut through emotions with rigorous financial analysis.

This is capital budgeting—applying TVM framework to the biggest decisions corporations make. Same present value logic from Sessions 1-4, now scaled to multi-billion dollar strategic investments using market-based discount rates from Sessions 6-8.

**AI Learning Support - Capital Budgeting Integration with Financial Framework**

**Learning Goal:** Master how capital budgeting synthesizes all previous financial concepts into systematic corporate investment decision-making.

**💼 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm studying capital budgeting as the culmination of financial analysis: TVM provides the present value mechanics, WACC gives the market-based discount rate, and cash flow analysis determines the investment inputs. My understanding is that NPV transforms strategic investment ideas into objective value creation measurements. This seems to solve the fundamental corporate finance question: which investments create shareholder value? I want to explore the practical challenges: How do corporate finance teams handle estimation uncertainty in long-term cash flows? What systematic approaches do they use to validate their assumptions? How do they balance quantitative NPV analysis with qualitative strategic considerations?"*

**🎯 Why This Shows Professional Corporate Finance Excellence:**

## Section 2: Foundational Concepts & Formulas

### Part I: Capital Budgeting Framework

**NPV Principle:** Accept projects where the present value of cash inflows exceeds the present value of cash outflows. This creates shareholder value by earning returns above the cost of capital.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** Present value of project cash flows minus initial investment
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** Discount rate that makes NPV equal zero
- **Payback Period:** Time required to recover initial investment
- **Profitability Index:** Present value of cash flows divided by initial investment
- **Hurdle Rate:** Minimum acceptable return (typically WACC)

### Part II: NPV Calculation and Decision Rules

**Net Present Value Formula:**
$$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} = -CF_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$

*Where CF₀ = initial investment (negative), CFₜ = cash flow in period t, r = discount rate (WACC)*

**Decision Rules:**
- **NPV > 0:** Accept project (creates shareholder value)
- **NPV < 0:** Reject project (destroys shareholder value)
- **NPV = 0:** Indifferent (earns exactly the cost of capital)

**Timeline for Capital Budgeting Process:**
```
Project Identification -----> Cash Flow Estimation -----> NPV Analysis -----> Decision
Strategic planning         Financial modeling          TVM application      Accept/Reject

Post-Implementation -----> Performance Monitoring -----> Learning Application
Project execution         Actual vs. projected       Improve future analysis
```

### Part III: Cash Flow Estimation Principles

**Operating Cash Flow Calculation:**
$$OCF = (Revenue - Costs - Depreciation) \times (1-T) + Depreciation$$
$$OCF = EBIT \times (1-T) + Depreciation$$

**Total Project Cash Flow Components:**
- **Initial Investment:** Equipment, working capital, installation costs
- **Operating Cash Flows:** After-tax operating income plus depreciation
- **Terminal Cash Flow:** Asset sale value plus working capital recovery

### Part IV: Integration with Course Framework

**Capital Budgeting's Foundation:**
```
Sessions 1-4: Master TVM mechanics for individual cash flows
Sessions 5-7: Understand risk-return relationships and market pricing
Session 9: Determine appropriate discount rate (WACC)
Session 10: Apply systematic framework to corporate investment decisions
```

**NPV vs. Previous Applications:**
```
Session 2: PV of single cash flow (car purchase)
Session 3: PV of multiple cash flows (stock dividends)
Session 4: PV of fixed cash flows (bond payments)
Session 10: PV of complex business cash flows (corporate projects)
```

## Section 3: The Gym - Partner Practice

### Round 1: Solo Practice (10 minutes)

**Problem 1 (Basic NPV):** Project requires \$100,000 investment, generates \$35,000 annually for 4 years. WACC = 10%. Calculate NPV and make recommendation.

**Timeline:**
```
-\$100,000 -----> \$35,000 -----> \$35,000 -----> \$35,000 -----> \$35,000
Today          Year 1        Year 2        Year 3        Year 4
   |              |             |             |             |
   |<------------- Discount at 10% WACC ----------------->|
```

**Problem 2 (Cash Flow Components):** Manufacturing project costs \$500,000, generates \$200,000 annual revenue, \$80,000 annual costs, \$50,000 annual depreciation. Tax rate = 30%. Calculate annual operating cash flow.

**AI Learning Support - NPV Methodology and Value Creation**

**Learning Goal:** Develop deep understanding of why NPV provides the gold standard for corporate investment decisions and shareholder value creation.

**💰 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm mastering NPV methodology and understand that positive NPV means project returns exceed the cost of capital, creating shareholder value. My analysis framework includes: systematic cash flow estimation, appropriate discount rate selection (WACC), and present value calculation. I want to strengthen my professional application: How do corporate finance teams handle competing projects with different NPVs and scales? What sensitivity analysis approaches do they use to test assumption robustness? How do they communicate NPV analysis to non-financial stakeholders and boards? What are the key limitations of NPV that professional analysts must acknowledge?"*

**📊 Why This Shows Professional Investment Analysis Skills:**
- ✅ **Value creation understanding**: Shows sophisticated grasp of NPV's economic meaning
- ✅ **Systematic methodology**: Demonstrates structured analytical approach
- ✅ **Stakeholder communication**: Shows awareness of presentation challenges
- ✅ **Limitation recognition**: Demonstrates professional skepticism and humility

**🤷 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**

### Round 2: Peer Teaching (15 minutes)
- Person A explains NPV calculation and why positive NPV creates shareholder value
- Person B explains operating cash flow calculation and tax effects
- Both discuss how capital budgeting connects to Sessions 1 and 8

### Round 3: Challenge Problems (15 minutes)
    
**Problem 3 (Competing Projects):** Two mutually exclusive projects:
- Project A: \$80,000 investment, \$25,000 for 5 years, NPV = \$14,570
- Project B: \$120,000 investment, \$35,000 for 5 years, NPV = \$12,860
Which should you choose and why?

**Problem 4 (Working Capital):** Project requires \$200,000 equipment plus \$30,000 additional inventory. Equipment depreciates over 5 years, inventory recovered at project end. Annual operating cash flow = \$60,000. WACC = 12%. Calculate NPV.

**Problem 5 (IRR Analysis):** Project with \$-150,000 initial cost and \$40,000 annual cash flows for 5 years has IRR = 15.2%. WACC = 12%. Should you accept? What if WACC = 18%?

**AI Learning Support - Advanced Capital Budgeting Metrics and Decision Frameworks**

**Learning Goal:** Master the relationship between different investment metrics and understand when each provides the most valuable insight for corporate decision-making.

**📈 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing the relationship between NPV, IRR, and payback period for investment decisions. My understanding is that NPV provides absolute value creation, IRR shows the project's inherent return rate, and payback indicates capital recovery speed. Each metric answers different questions for management teams. I want to deepen my professional application: When might IRR and NPV give conflicting recommendations? How do corporate finance teams handle mutually exclusive projects with different scales and timing? What role should payback period play in capital allocation decisions? How do they present these metrics to different stakeholder groups?"*

## Section 4: The Coaching - Your DRIVER Learning Guide

Let's apply DRIVER to a comprehensive capital budgeting analysis, integrating all your TVM and corporate finance knowledge.

> **Case Scenario for Coaching:** Electric vehicle charging network expansion. ChargePoint Corp evaluates \$50M network deployment: 500 charging stations at \$100K each. Projections: Year 1-2: \$8M annual cash flows, Year 3-7: \$15M annual cash flows, Year 8-10: \$12M declining cash flows, Year 10: \$5M salvage value. WACC = 11%. Additional: \$3M working capital required, recovered at project end.

**Investment Framework:**
```
Initial Investment: \$50M equipment + \$3M working capital = \$53M

Cash Flow Pattern: Growing then declining over 10-year horizon

Terminal Recovery: \$5M salvage + \$3M working capital = \$8M

Decision: NPV analysis using 11% WACC hurdle rate
