      "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by constructing free cash flows that include the initial investment and discounting them at the WACC, reporting specific NPV results across multiple discount rates. They also validated the computation behaviorally (IRR back-check and NPV curve), demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding. Hence, this meets a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule—accept when NPV > 0 at the hurdle rate and reject when NPV < 0—and does so thoroughly across base and sensitivity cases. They explicitly tie the decision to the 8.5% WACC, compute NPV, and make an accept call, while also discussing a negative-NPV scenario, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR but rigorously validated that it is the discount rate making NPV ≈ 0, and corroborated it graphically. The Implement and Validate stages together show thorough understanding and correct application, meeting a comprehensive standard for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly constructs project free cash flows that are largely incremental: initial capex plus working capital outlay and recovery, operating cash flows based on EBIT (no financing), and an after-tax terminal value. However, the treatment is basic; they do not discuss key incremental considerations such as cannibalization of existing store sales, opportunity costs, or exclusion of non-incremental overhead/sunk costs. Given the moderate standard, this shows sound but not thorough mastery, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and conceptually treats terminal value as after-tax and NWC recovery as tax-neutral, and integrates both into the terminal-year cash flow, showing understanding across DRIVER stages. However, the treatment is basic: no explicit after-tax salvage calculation (e.g., proceeds vs. book value, tax on recapture) or numerical detail supporting the $3M after-tax figure. This satisfies a correct but not thorough treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly executed and validated the model personally (base case metrics, IRR verification) and implemented scenario/sensitivity runs (revenue -20% and multiple WACCs) with interpretation. However, they did not explicitly present a best/optimistic revenue scenario (best/base/worst required by this criterion), so the scenario-modeling requirement is only partially satisfied.",

Use of DRIVER stages to structure the formula (Represent) and execute calculations (Implementation), plus interpretation (Reflect), demonstrates strong conceptual and applied mastery suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined the NPV decision rule, tied it to WACC, and applied it rigorously in both base case and sensitivity analyses. Multiple concrete instances of accept/reject decisions based on NPV demonstrate thorough, conceptually sound understanding, meeting the PASS standard for a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR (17.3%) but also interpreted it against the hurdle rate and explored IRR across scenarios, demonstrating depth. Their explicit link between zero NPV and earning the discount rate shows correct conceptual grounding of IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero. The Implementation and Validation stages provide thorough, accurate treatment, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and applies both simple and discounted payback, showing conceptual understanding and using them in the decision. However, the stated simple payback (4.1 years) conflicts with the provided cash flow timeline (which implies recovery occurs after Year 5), and no calculation steps are shown to reconcile this. Due to this accuracy inconsistency, coverage is solid but not thorough enough for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included both salvage value and full working capital recovery at Year 10 and discounted them, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not apply after-tax treatment to salvage despite full depreciation over 10 years (implying a taxable gain/recapture), overstating terminal value. This gap prevents a thorough PASS, so the criterion is only partially met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly conducted external validation conceptually—citing actual roastery performance and running thorough sensitivity analyses in the Validate stage—but did not name explicit external sources or referenceable tools/websites for those data. Under the moderate standard, this demonstrates partial compliance: validation is present and reasonable, but lacks the specific cited external sources required for a full PASS.",
