STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly computed NPV from detailed free cash flows (including depreciation tax shields, working capital recovery, and taxed terminal value), reported the numeric result (~$2.7M), performed sensitivity analysis, and validated the outputs in Excel. Those elements plus the explicit planning, implementation, and reflection demonstrate a strong, comprehensive grasp of NPV consistent with a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined the NPV decision rule, computed a numeric NPV (~$2.7M) and used it to recommend acceptance, and demonstrated application via sensitivity scenarios (e.g., NPV turning negative with -20% revenue) and Excel validation. This is a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a numeric IRR (12.84%), explicitly defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, applied it in sensitivity analysis (comparing to WACC), and validated outputs in Excel. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed systematic internal validation (Excel checks, recalculated NPV/IRR, corrected errors) and compared IRR to the WACC hurdle. However, they did not cite or compare results to any external trusted sources/tools beyond their own Excel verification. That meets partial validation but falls short of the criterion's requirement for external source comparison, so PARTIAL.
- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed systematic internal validation (Excel checks, found and fixed an error) and compared project IRR to the WACC hurdle, demonstrating validation of assumptions against the investment hurdle. However, they did not cite or compare to any external authoritative sources or tools beyond their own Excel checks, so validation is incomplete per the criterion’s external‑comparison requirement — therefore PARTIAL.
- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student used and validated the given internal projections but did not present or cite any comparable Starbucks store performance or external benchmarking data. The criterion requires explicit comparable performance data (external or peer benchmarks); since none are provided, this fails the requirement."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructed free cash flows, applied depreciation and taxes, discounted the terminal and yearly cash flows to compute a quantitative NPV (2.69M) and performed sensitivity analysis. The depth and specificity of the cash-flow construction, discounting, and robustness checks meet the standards for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student states the NPV decision rule explicitly, applies it quantitatively (NPV = $2.69M; IRR > WACC), and conducts sensitivity analyses showing conditions that flip NPV negative. This clear definition plus applied calculations and robustness checks meet the thoroughness required for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a specific IRR (12.84%), applied it correctly against the 8.5% hurdle, and incorporated that result into the project recommendation and sensitivity analysis. The IRR calculation and application are explicit and used across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports numeric NPV and IRR results and references an implemented model, they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, or ownership of the code (instead citing Gemini assistance). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of running/verifying code and explaining its components, the submission fails to meet the required evidence of correct technical implementation.
- Technical Implementation: The student presents detailed cash‑flow figures and a timeline (Represent) and references a coded implementation (Implement), but does not explicitly demonstrate that they personally ran, verified, or can explain the code step‑by‑step. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and ownership of code, the submission fails to provide the required evidence of accurate, independently validated cash‑flow projections.
- Technical Implementation: The student correctly calculated and applied straight‑line depreciation, used EBIT×(1−T) and added back depreciation in operating cash flows, and treated terminal sale net of tax and working‑capital recovery—demonstrating correct conceptual and numerical treatment. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block‑by‑block code/verification (they reference Gemini/code but do not show ownership or stepwise explanation), so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rather than PASS."
