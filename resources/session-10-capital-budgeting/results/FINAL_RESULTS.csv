"1","037061012","adamayo","Aren Dominic Damayo","92.72%","Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.


STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV: identified and discounted future cash flows at WACC, included year-0 outlay and working-capital timing, validated discounting with an explicit calculation, and reported/interpreted NPV across base and sensitivity cases. This demonstrates strong conceptual and applied understanding beyond a basic mention, meeting a PASS under moderate strictness.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulated and applied the NPV decision rule: positive NPV → accept, negative NPV → reject, and tied this to their decision. They reinforced this with sensitivity analysis showing how a negative NPV under revenue stress would reverse the decision. This demonstrates thorough, conceptually solid treatment appropriate for a PASS under moderate strictness.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero, computes and reports IRR (12.5%) from the model, compares it to WACC for decision-making, and explores IRR behavior under sensitivity (-20% revenue). This shows a strong, applied understanding beyond basics, satisfying the moderate standard for thoroughness.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes working capital recovery (outflow at t=0, inflow at year 10) and conceptually addresses terminal value with salvage sold at book (no tax), and includes salvage in the depreciation base. However, they do not thoroughly demonstrate or verify the explicit inclusion of terminal salvage proceeds and WC recovery in the terminal-year cash flow, leaving the treatment at a basic conceptual level rather than a detailed, confirmed application. Hence, PARTIAL.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student correctly conducted and discussed sensitivity of NPV to key drivers (revenue, WACC) and interpreted implications, showing conceptual understanding. However, there is no clear visualization (e.g., charts/tornado/table) of NPV sensitivity, and coverage is limited to a few scenarios, so treatment is basic rather than thorough.
- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student clearly presents detailed quantitative analysis (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity with numeric outcomes) but the strategic discussion, while present, is high-level and not deeply developed or quantified. That balance demonstrates correct understanding but is not sufficiently thorough on the strategic side to merit a full PASS."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV, detailing discounting of annual cash flows at WACC and inclusion of key elements (initial outlay, working capital timing, terminal value, depreciation tax effects). They compute and interpret a specific NPV and perform sensitivity analyses. This depth and correct application across DRIVER stages meets a PASS standard despite minor inconsistencies elsewhere.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains the NPV decision rule and applies it correctly: discounting at WACC, interpreting negative NPV as value destruction, and recommending rejection. They reinforce this across stages with sensitivity and reflection, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately identified and computed both simple and discounted payback periods and interpreted their implications. They described the computation approach (cumulative cash flows), produced concrete results, and contextualized them, demonstrating a strong conceptual grasp appropriate for a moderate evaluation.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The reported IRR (94.94%) is inconsistent with a negative NPV at 8.5% and the conventional single sign-change cash-flow pattern, indicating an incorrect IRR computation and a misunderstanding (mislabeling cash flows as non-conventional). While the student mentions calculating IRR, they do not correctly compute or interpret “the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero,” thus failing this criterion.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding that OCF comes from after-tax EBIT with depreciation added back, and integrates this in the implementation and validation stages. However, wording is inconsistent (refers to “depreciation tax shield” instead of clearly using EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation) and lacks explicit numerical demonstration, so coverage is solid but not thorough enough for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly recognizes and includes both salvage value and working capital recovery and notes that terminal value should be taxed. However, the validation shows a terminal inflow seemingly adding $3.0M salvage + $0.5M WC without explicit tax, and the depreciation discussion conflicts (full $12M vs. “net salvage” base), leaving ambiguity on correct tax treatment. This demonstrates correct but incomplete handling, warranting PARTIAL."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines relevant cash flows (including initial outlay, NWC timing, and taxed salvage), discounts them at the 8.5% hurdle, and reports a computed NPV (~$2.6M). The implementation details and sensitivity analysis show thorough, correct application of NPV, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: positive NPV implies value creation and acceptance, while negative NPV under adverse scenarios implies value destruction. They discuss discounting at the hurdle rate and test multiple scenarios (base case, higher cost of capital, revenue drop), demonstrating thorough, applied understanding across DRIVER stages.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated both simple and discounted payback with specific values and visualized the breakeven, directly addressing recovery time. They integrated these results into their decision context, showing solid conceptual understanding. A minor wording inconsistency (“six-year discounted payback”) doesn’t negate the otherwise thorough treatment.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and used IRR in base and stress cases and tied it to decision-making, showing solid practical application. However, they did not explain IRR conceptually as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate that relationship, so coverage is correct but not thorough.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly indicates that a profitability index was computed and shows understanding of discounting cash flows, but provides no formula, PI value, or detailed discussion tying PV of benefits to the initial investment. Given the moderate standard, this demonstrates correct but basic treatment, warranting a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains operating cash flow as EBIT after tax plus depreciation and highlights depreciation’s non-cash tax effect, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they don’t provide detailed OCF calculations or year-by-year examples to demonstrate thorough application. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but not comprehensive, so PARTIAL."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV by defining the discount rate, structuring all cash flows including initial outlay, working capital, and terminal value, and coding and reporting the NPV result. Sensitivity and visualization further demonstrate depth of understanding. The DRIVER stages collectively show a comprehensive, accurate treatment of NPV.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly ties acceptance to positive NPV relative to the hurdle rate and notes that negative NPV under adverse revenue would reverse the decision, demonstrating the NPV decision rule. They compute NPV, interpret it, and apply sensitivity to discuss accept/reject conditions, showing thorough, conceptually sound treatment across DRIVER stages.
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they implemented and ran NPV and IRR functions, provides the numeric outputs, and demonstrates validation of the underlying cash flows that feed those metrics. This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level modeling, and ownership, so the criterion is satisfied.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR from the project cash flows and used it correctly in decision-making and sensitivity, showing it is independent of WACC changes. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate that property, providing only brief results without depth. This reflects correct but basic treatment, meriting a PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and computed both simple and discounted payback and provided clear base-case values, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not detail the year-by-year cumulative cash flows, discuss inclusion effects (e.g., working capital timing) on payback, or analyze scenario sensitivity for payback, making the treatment accurate but basic rather than thorough.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of inflows relative to initial outlay, applies it with the proper discount rate, reports a PI value (1.24), and interprets it. However, they do not show the detailed calculation (e.g., PV sum or initial outlay components) or explore PI across scenarios, so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines NPV, describes discounting and subtracting the initial investment, and applies it using the project’s WACC. They present concrete NPV results for the base case and multiple sensitivity scenarios, and interpret implications for decision-making. This demonstrates thorough conceptual understanding and application sufficient for a PASS under moderate standards.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and then applied it with computed values for the base case and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating understanding beyond a surface-level definition. They also correctly noted that changing WACC does not change IRR, using IRR in decision-making comparisons, which reflects thorough and accurate conceptual and applied grasp under a moderate standard.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines PI as present value of future benefits divided by the initial investment and applies the >1 threshold. They also compute and interpret PI across scenarios (e.g., base PI 1.24), demonstrating application and understanding. This satisfies a thorough, conceptually solid treatment under the moderate standard.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; negative NPV implies value destruction) to the base case and a sensitivity scenario. However, the treatment is basic, lacking deeper discussion (e.g., zero NPV indifference, choosing among alternatives, prioritization of NPV versus other metrics). Hence, this meets a correct but not thorough standard.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguished simple vs. discounted payback and produced a (discounted) payback estimate, interpreting that recovery exceeds the project life. However, they included inaccuracies (simple payback as initial investment divided by average cash flows; claiming discounted payback decreases when WACC increases), indicating gaps in accuracy. This supports a correct-but-incomplete understanding, meriting PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly incorporated operating items, initial CapEx, and working capital changes into the cash-flow build, demonstrating a basic conceptual grasp of free cash flow. However, they did not explicitly define or calculate FCF as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus changes in working capital, nor did they show the OCF step distinctly. Given the moderate standard, this supports a correct but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL."
"6","036568738","amandhad","Anvitha Mandhadi","93.31%","Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.


STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explained and applied NPV: defined the decision rule, structured FCFs, implemented a custom NPV function that discounts cash flows (including t=0), and validated calculations with manual checks. They reported a base-case NPV and conducted sensitivity analyses, demonstrating strong conceptual and practical mastery consistent with a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the correct NPV decision rule and applies it to the base case and adverse scenarios, interpreting positive NPV as accept and negative NPV as reject. Custom implementation and scenario analysis demonstrate depth beyond a surface mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment under a moderate standard.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero and implements it via bisection, demonstrating sound computational understanding. They report IRR results for base and scenario cases and correctly note IRR’s independence from WACC, showing depth beyond a surface mention. The DRIVER stages used provide thorough, credible evidence of accurate IRR computation.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly defined simple and discounted payback and applied them to the base case, reporting approximate recovery years. However, the treatment stays basic: results are approximate and slightly inconsistent (year 10 vs year 9), with no detailed cumulative schedule, fractional-year interpolation, or sensitivity discussion. This demonstrates understanding but not the thoroughness needed for a full PASS.
- Technical Implementation: The student clearly implemented and validated the base case and a downside (20% revenue) scenario and tested WACC variations, demonstrating personal execution and ownership. However, they did not explicitly present a revenue-based best‑case (upside) scenario labelled as such, so the scenario‑modeling requirement (best/base/worst) is only partially satisfied.
- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed solid internal validation checks and explicitly compared project metrics (NPV, IRR) to the firm's 8.5% hurdle rate, fulfilling testing assumptions and hurdle comparison. However, they did not cite or use any external calculators, benchmarks, or third‑party sources to cross-check results, so per the category standard this meets validation partially rather than fully."
"7","037166275","apumphre","Anne Pumphrey","56.03%","Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.


STRENGTHS:
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and described their code, provided block-by-block explanation of what each part does, and documented validation steps confirming correct cash-flow construction and application of the 8.5% hurdle for NPV/IRR. Those explicit implementation and validation statements satisfy the strict requirements for demonstrating correct NPV and IRR calculations.
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly demonstrated representation, implementation, and validation of cash flow projections (ran code, showed yearly ICF/DCFs, and verified depreciation, working capital treatment, terminal value, and WACC). This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level understanding of what the code does, and ownership of validation, so the criterion is satisfied.
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the depreciation method and amount, the corporate tax rate, and that they ran and validated the model outputs including depreciation, tax shields, and working-capital tax effects. These concrete, self-reported checks across Implement and Validate meet the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described discounting cash flows (DCF), applying the 8.5% WACC, and including year-0 outflows, demonstrating a sound conceptual grasp of NPV. However, they did not show the explicit NPV calculation or any numeric NPV result, leaving the treatment short of thorough. Under moderate strictness, this merits a Partial.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows they used NPV with the 8.5% hurdle rate and evaluated accept/reject, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly state the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) or present the NPV result, limiting depth. Thus, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and discussed IRR, compared it to WACC, and articulated a key property (intrinsic to cash flows). However, they did not explicitly describe or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero nor provide the computed IRR value, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough."
"8","032277341","asumpter","Ray Sumpter","15.42%","Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.


STRENGTHS:
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student applies a systematic framework by defining objectives, building a diversified portfolio, and conducting structured stress tests across rate and spread risks, then interpreting results via duration and liability matching. The inclusion of scenario outcomes, modified/Macaulay duration, and credit-quality considerations demonstrates depth beyond a surface mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for this criterion.
- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission shows a systematic implementation: data assembled into a portfolio matrix, code executed and debugged, and scenario-based sensitivity analysis (multiple interest-rate shocks and credit-spread widening) with duration-derived price-change estimates. This meets the moderate DRIVER standard for a systematic NPV/price-sensitivity implementation.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not mention or compute NPV, nor does it conceptually explain discounting cash flows and subtracting the initial investment. While the student discusses duration and rate/credit shocks, those do not satisfy the NPV criterion, even under a moderate standard.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on bond portfolio construction, duration matching, and rate/credit stress tests, with no mention or application of the NPV decision rule. Given the absence of any conceptual or applied discussion of accepting/rejecting projects based on NPV, the criterion is not demonstrated.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion, calculation, or conceptual explanation of IRR or the NPV=0 condition. Content focuses on duration, yield, and credit spreads. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but IRR is missing entirely, warranting a FAIL."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and correctly states the NPV accept/reject rule and applies it to a concrete project, concluding acceptance when NPV is positive. They further verify the components and explore sensitivity, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention. These DRIVER stages collectively show thorough understanding suitable for a PASS under the moderate standard.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly models multi-phase cash flows (ramp-up, full production, decline, and a terminal sale), translates them into a timeline, and implements them in code, then verifies completeness and performs sensitivity analysis. This shows thorough, applied understanding of multi-phase cash flow modeling within the DRIVER framework. Minor transcription slips do not detract from the comprehensive treatment.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a thorough, structured capital budgeting framework: defining the decision, laying out cash flows, applying WACC and the NPV decision rule, implementing in Python, and verifying inputs and logic, then extending to sensitivities. This end-to-end, multi-stage treatment demonstrates a systematic investment evaluation framework consistent with the DRIVER method, meeting the PASS standard in a moderate category.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a solid conceptual grasp of NPV, lays out cash flows, states the formula and decision rule, and implements a computation yielding ~$2.1B, supported by verification and sensitivity discussion. However, multiple numeric inaccuracies (e.g., CF0 as -20,000 vs. -2,000; inconsistent cash flow list) undermine accuracy, so the treatment is correct but not thorough/clean enough for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV and does not compute or explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero. Under moderate strictness, a conceptual explanation would suffice, but IRR is only mentioned as a future task with no method, calculation, or interpretation provided.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion specifically requires determining the payback period. The submission does not mention or compute the time required to recover the initial investment, nor does it conceptually discuss payback. Despite solid NPV work across DRIVER stages, the payback period is omitted, resulting in a fail for this criterion."

The workflow is clearly tied to DRIVER stages and supported by specific figures, meeting the depth needed for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately stated the NPV decision rule and applied it to base-case results and sensitivity scenarios, then used it to make a clear accept/reject recommendation. The discussion includes the correct discount rate context and multiple applications (base case and sensitivities), demonstrating a strong, thorough grasp suitable for a PASS.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student demonstrates automated capital budgeting by referencing code-generated year-by-year cash flows, automated computation of NPV/IRR/payback, and scenario sensitivities. This reflects a thorough, technology-enabled implementation and validation consistent with the Implement and Validate/Execute stages, with Evolve suggesting further automated extensions.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR and applies the proper decision rule, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, they do not explain or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor provide methodological detail, which limits depth. Hence, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL rather than PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported both discounted and undiscounted payback periods and built a year-by-year cash flow model, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain how the payback was derived (e.g., cumulative cash flow crossover, treatment of working capital recovery or terminal value) or interpret its implications. The coverage is correct but basic, meeting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a Profitability Index and demonstrated use of discounted cash flows and the initial outlay, indicating conceptual understanding.

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined NPV and applied it by constructing cash flows including the initial outlay, discounting at WACC, and interpreting NPV for decision-making. Multiple scenario analyses (base, revenue drop, WACC changes) and clear acceptance rules show thorough, correct treatment consistent with a strong grasp of NPV.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the NPV decision rule and applies it correctly to multiple scenarios (base, -20% revenue), demonstrating depth beyond a surface mention. The DRIVER stages show conceptual setup, implementation with results, and reflective decision-making aligned to NPV, satisfying a thorough treatment for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately computed and interpreted both simple and discounted payback, explained why discounted payback is longer (TVM), and contextualized the result against the project’s 10-year life. Evidence across Discover, Implement, and Reflect shows thorough, conceptually sound treatment beyond a surface mention, meeting PASS criteria.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero and applies it correctly in base and downside scenarios, comparing to WACC to drive decisions. However, the treatment is brief and lacks deeper methodological explanation or exploration beyond basic usage, so it demonstrates correct but basic understanding consistent with PARTIAL under moderate strictness.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines PI as PV of cash flows relative to upfront cost and provides a computed value with clear interpretation, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: no explicit formula application is shown and PI isn’t extended to sensitivity scenarios, limiting depth. Under moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies the components (OCF, CapEx, working capital) and produces an FCF timeline, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly apply the FCF formula (OCF minus CapEx minus changes in working capital) and at one point equate OCF and FCF despite noting a working capital outflow, suggesting incomplete or possibly inaccurate application. Lack of detail on working capital changes over time or recovery prevents a thorough PASS."

They extend this with sensitivity to discount rate, indicating broader application. This demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp sufficient for a PASS under moderate strictness.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a comprehensive, systematic investment evaluation: defines inputs, lays out cash-flow construction, computes and interprets NPV/IRR/PI/payback, and performs scenario analysis on key drivers. Evidence across Discover, Implement, and Evolve shows application of a full framework, satisfying a thorough treatment under moderate strictness despite minor phrasing and numerical imprecision.
- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the investment question, provides the key financial inputs (cash flows, costs, tax, terminal value, WACC), and states the decision criteria and planned analyses (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity tests). This clear, explicit articulation meets the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified NPV components (discount rate, initial investment, OCF = NI + depreciation, working capital changes, terminal value) and reported an NPV used for decision-making, with sensitivity discussion. However, the treatment lacks detailed derivation and contains inconsistent NPV figures, so coverage is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported an IRR (13.25%) and used it appropriately by comparing to the hurdle rate and discussing sensitivity, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate the computation process, leaving coverage shallow for this criterion. Hence, Partial rather than Pass.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies both simple and discounted payback years, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the treatment is brief, lacks cumulative cash flow support, and includes a muddled explanation around year 6–9, falling short of a thorough, well-explained derivation.

- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student explicitly applied and narrated the DRIVER stages, produced quantitative outputs (NPV, IRR) and documented the computational method (Python), and linked insights to decision recommendations. This demonstrates a thorough, communicative treatment meeting the criterion.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct, applied understanding of NPV by referencing WACC-based discounting over years 0–10, the initial investment, and reporting a specific NPV used for a go/no-go decision.

This demonstrates personal execution, understanding of the functions, and ownership—meeting the strict Technical Implementation standard.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported IRR using an appropriate method and interpreted it against a hurdle rate, showing basic conceptual understanding.

They presented base-case NPV, tied it to the decision rule, and performed sensitivity analyses, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly stated the NPV accept/reject rule, computed and applied it in the base case, and tested it under adverse scenarios where NPV turned negative, interpreting that as value-destroying. Multiple applications across DRIVER stages demonstrate a strong, thorough grasp of when to accept or reject based on NPV, meeting the PASS threshold.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and reported both simple and discounted payback periods with specific values and an interpretation of the discounted result. Their cash flow modeling description shows how the inputs enable payback computation. Given the moderate standard, this constitutes a thorough, accurate treatment of the payback period.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR, compares it to WACC, and examines sensitivity, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero or show any verification/derivation, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.

However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation process, making the treatment accurate but basic. Thus, under moderate strictness, this supports a PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports both simple (5.28 years) and discounted (8.21 years) payback and provides a brief, accurate interpretation of each. However, they do not show the cumulative cash flow path, the fraction-year derivation, or sensitivity impacts on payback, resulting in a basic rather than thorough treatment. Hence, correct but not comprehensive → PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a PI of 1.24 and provides the right interpretation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not demonstrate the calculation as present value of benefits divided by initial investment or provide supporting detail, making the treatment basic rather than thorough.

The coverage is comprehensive across DRIVER stages, showing strong conceptual grasp and application sufficient for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule and applies it to the base case and sensitivity cases to make accept/reject calls. They also justify relying on NPV when payback metrics conflict, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding. Minor sign inconsistency in one sentence doesn’t undermine the comprehensive, correct application.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and applies it by computing and interpreting IRR for the base and multiple scenarios, comparing it to WACC to make decisions. Multiple applications (base, revenue drop, WACC shifts) and consistency checks demonstrate a strong, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: While the student defines payback conceptually, the reported payback periods (11.67 and 22.26 years) are inconsistent with their own cash flows and a positive NPV. Given a -$12.5M initial outlay and sizeable annual OCFs plus a $5.3M terminal-year FCF, simple payback should occur well before year 10, not after, indicating an inaccurate determination.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the profitability index and reported a computed PI > 1, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not show the calculation details (e.g., explicit PV of benefits vs. initial outlay) or reconcile PI with NPV, leaving depth and thoroughness lacking for a full PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding by correctly using OCF = NI + Depreciation and applying it to the EBIT=0 case, yielding OCF equal to depreciation. However, they also present an incorrect formula (EBIT×(1−T) + DTS instead of + Depreciation), indicating a conceptual gap.

They report interpretation (positive NPV) and perform sensitivity checks. Across Discover, Represent, Implement, and Validate stages, the treatment is comprehensive and conceptually solid, meeting PASS standards.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule, stating positive NPV adds value (accept) and showing a negative-NPV scenario that would undermine the project (reject). They demonstrated this across base and sensitivity cases and connected it to WACC-based discounting, meeting the moderate standard with thorough, applied discussion.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and describes computing it via a bisection root-finding method, supported by manual NPV calculation. They validate convergence and explain that IRR is internal to cash flows (independent of WACC), applying it in base and sensitivity analyses. This demonstrates thorough conceptual understanding appropriate for a PASS under moderate strictness.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR (12.84%) and linked it to the accept/reject rule versus WACC, and their sensitivity analysis shows NPV crossing zero near 13%, consistent with the IRR. However, they did not explicitly define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation beyond tool output, so coverage is correct but not thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.

- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed NPV with an appropriate discount rate, included key cash flow components (initial investment, working capital recovery, terminal value), and provided a specific NPV result with interpretation and sensitivity—demonstrating applied understanding. However, the stated explanation that NPV “subtracts depreciation” reflects a conceptual error in cash flow treatment, preventing a thorough, fully accurate treatment required for PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR (12.84%), compares it to WACC, and discusses sensitivity, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero nor demonstrate that NPV equals zero at the computed IRR, leaving the treatment incomplete for a thorough PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: They computed and discussed a profitability index and correctly noted the ratio interpretation ($1.32 per $1). However, they mislabeled PI with “years” and did not articulate that PI equals the present value of benefits divided by the initial investment.

However, they did not account for taxes on the salvage proceeds (especially material given full straight-line depreciation), making the treatment incomplete. Hence, partial credit.
- Technical Implementation: Although the student explicitly demonstrates personal implementation and DRIVER stages, the reported numeric results are inconsistent with the detailed cash-flow items and discounting described (the summed discounted inflows implied by their per-year OCFs do not reconcile with the stated NPV/IRR).

- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes having written and run a cash-flow function with block-level detail (depreciation, EBIT, taxes, add-back, terminal value) and reports concrete NPV/IRR results. They also state the precise validation methods (WACC discounting and numpy_financial IRR), demonstrating personal execution, ownership, and sufficient technical understanding required by the strict standard.
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly parameterized inputs, described each cash-flow computation step (depreciation, operating cash flow, terminal value, working-capital recovery), and reported model outputs and scenario checks, showing personal implementation and verification. This meets the strict technical-implementation requirements for accurate cash-flow projections over the project life.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the NPV decision rule by linking a positive NPV to value creation and an accept decision, and acknowledged the implication of potentially negative NPV in sensitivity. However, they did not explicitly articulate the full accept/reject rule (e.g., accept if NPV ≥ 0, reject if NPV < 0) or provide a comprehensive discussion of boundary cases, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and computes IRR and interprets it relative to the hurdle rate, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: only a single IRR result is reported and sensitivity/diagnostics focus on NPV rather than IRR, with no deeper discussion (e.g., cash flow sign issues or multiple IRRs). This supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and computed the simple payback period, provided an approximate result, and supported it with a breakeven chart, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth (no cumulative schedule, no discounted payback, and no scenario-specific payback analysis), so it is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS."

Using Newton’s method indicates solving for the rate that zeros NPV, and multiple applications (base case and downside) show strong, accurate understanding. This meets a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for a moderate category.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of benefits over initial investment and applies it with a base-case value (1.22) and interpretation.

However, they do not explicitly articulate FCF as OCF less capex and changes in working capital across periods or provide detailed numeric demonstration, limiting depth. Under a moderate standard, this supports a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements key incremental cash flows (initial capex, changes in working capital, OCF with tax shield, after-tax salvage), showing solid conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth on excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, cannibalization, opportunity costs), so the coverage is sound but not thorough enough for a PASS."

They further demonstrated understanding through implementation details and sensitivity analysis, satisfying a comprehensive, conceptually solid treatment under the DRIVER framework.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule (positive NPV ⇒ accept) and tests it across multiple scenarios, noting when NPV turns negative and when the decision remains accept. They integrate these results into a final recommendation, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding aligned with DRIVER stages (Validate, Evolve, Reflect).
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: PASS because the student accurately defines IRR, implements a method to compute it, and reports a concrete IRR (12.84%) used in decision-making. They also interpret IRR relative to WACC and across scenarios, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding within the DRIVER stages.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both terminal value and working capital recovery in Year 10 and integrates them through Represent, Implement, and Validate. However, they do not address the after-tax treatment of terminal/salvage proceeds or their relation to book value, implying potential omission of taxes on salvage.

- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal validation and compared IRR to the WACC and ran WACC sensitivity, showing understanding of the investment hurdle. However, they did not cite any external sources or tools (e.g., calculators, published benchmarks) as required for a full PASS, so the validation is general/internal and thus scores PARTIAL.

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student built a comprehensive cash-flow schedule (including initial outlay, annual FCFs, terminal value tax effects, and NWC recovery) and discounted them at 8.5% to arrive at NPV ≈ $2.69M. Despite a minor verbal sign slip in the formula description, the calculation, components, and sensitivity discussion show strong conceptual and applied mastery of NPV. Hence, PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid grasp of the NPV decision rule: using the 8.5% hurdle to assess value creation, accepting when NPV is positive in the base case, and rejecting under adverse scenarios (e.g., revenue −20%). Their sensitivity discussion and linkage of NPV to accept/reject decisions across discount rates and assumptions show thorough, conceptually accurate application consistent with the DRIVER stages.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid, applied understanding of free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusted for capital expenditures and working capital changes, including depreciation add-back, initial capex, NWC outflow/recovery, and terminal value with taxes. They mapped this into an annual cash flow schedule and validated construction of unlevered free cash flow. Minor wording inconsistencies do not undermine the thorough, correct treatment.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes IRR as a key metric, attempts to compute it, and uses it in decision framing against the hurdle rate. However, the IRR value reported (“IR 2.84”) is unclear and likely inaccurate, and there is no demonstration or explanation that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero. Given the conceptual linkage but lack of clear, accurate computation and depth, this merits PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly reports a “payback of 28 years,” which is inconsistent with their own cash flow schedule (undiscounted recovery would occur around year 6, not 28). Although they reference implementing a payback metric, the inaccurate result shows a fundamental error in determining the time to recover the initial investment, failing this criterion under financial accuracy.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not define, discuss, or calculate the Profitability Index (present value of benefits divided by initial investment). Despite covering other metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) and building a cash flow model, there is no conceptual or computational treatment of PI in any DRIVER stage, so the criterion is not met."

They apply the rule across scenarios and explicitly base their recommendation on a positive NPV and PI>1, showing thorough, conceptually sound understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined both payback period methods, computed base-case values, and analyzed sensitivity (WACC changes and revenue downside) including the case where discounted payback is not achieved. Despite minor unit wording issues, the treatment is thorough and demonstrates strong conceptual understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined the PI formula, implemented a calculation within their model, produced a numeric PI (~1.24), and used it appropriately for ranking and acceptance decisions. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with moderate strictness standards.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual understanding of NPV (discount future cash flows at WACC and compare to the initial outlay) and applies it in a model with scenario analysis. However, inconsistent and erroneous figures (initial investment stated as both 1,200 million and 12 million; unit issues like “Year two 270 million”) undermine calculation accuracy.

They demonstrate this in base-case results and multiple sensitivities (revenue down, WACC up), providing concrete accept/reject conclusions. This comprehensive, applied treatment meets the standard for a PASS despite unrelated payback issues.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR from modeled cash flows, reported a base-case IRR (13.25%), compared it appropriately to the 8.5% hurdle, and performed sensitivity showing IRR falling to 3.88% under a 20% revenue drop. This demonstrates a strong, applied grasp of IRR as the discount rate making NPV zero, with multiple applications across scenarios. Minor inconsistencies elsewhere do not undermine the thorough treatment of IRR.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrated strong conceptual mastery by identifying an erroneous computed payback, diagnosing the cause (cumulative cash flow logic), and providing a reasonable corrected estimate (~5.2 years) grounded in the cash flow schedule. This depth of analysis and self-correction meets the moderate standard and reflects thorough treatment of payback period determination despite the initial error.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Despite some inconsistent calculations elsewhere, the conceptual understanding and application are thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructed an incremental cash flow schedule and included all key project-only components (capex, changes in working capital, depreciation tax shield, terminal value) while correctly excluding financing costs. The treatment of working capital recovery and the detailed, year-by-year structure show comprehensive application, satisfying a thorough, conceptually accurate understanding for this criterion.
- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly automated capital budgeting calculations by leveraging AI tools to build a model, generate code, compute key metrics (NPV, IRR, payback, PI), and run sensitivity analyses. Multiple automated outputs and visualizations show comprehensive application. Despite inconsistencies in results, the automation criterion is clearly met at a strong level.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set up and applied the NPV framework (cash flows, WACC discounting, WC recovery, terminal value) and discussed sensitivity, showing conceptual understanding. However, base-case NPV results conflict (+$3.02M vs -$0.277M) and there’s a tax shield misstatement (“Tax shields 30% each year” with a 25% tax rate), undermining accuracy. Thus, the treatment is competent but not consistently correct, warranting PARTIAL.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student computed and applied IRR, correctly linking IRR vs. WACC to NPV sign, showing conceptual understanding. However, conflicting IRR outputs (13.25% vs 8.13%) and inconsistent NPV signs without reconciliation indicate gaps in accuracy and thoroughness. Under moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and discussed both simple and discounted payback, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, results are inconsistent (5.28 vs 7.11 years; discounted payback 8.21 years vs infinite) with minimal methodological explanation, limiting accuracy and depth.

They further demonstrate depth by discussing the NPV=0 break-even threshold and sensitivity to discount rate, showing strong conceptual grasp across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.
- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states treatment of depreciation (straight-line) and that tax rate is an input used in the operating cash flow calculation, and they ran and validated the code outputs for specific years. That demonstrates personal execution, block-level understanding of how depreciation and taxes feed into OCF/FCF, and ownership of verification, meeting the strict criteria.

- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions payback period as a metric but provides no calculation, value, or conceptual explanation of how the payback period is determined or why it matters. Implementation and reflection focus solely on NPV and IRR, with payback only name-checked. Under the moderate standard, a basic conceptual discussion would suffice; since that is missing, the criterion fails.

- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported an IRR (12.84%) and compared it to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate how it was computed; discussion remained surface-level.

Multiple applications and explicit validation within DRIVER show a thorough, accurate understanding that meets the PASS standard.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero and computed it (12.84%) from modeled cash flows, then applied it in decision-making against WACC and across scenarios. The discussion shows depth beyond a mention (definition, calculation via code, comparison, and use in sensitivity), meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under moderate strictness.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined PI as PV of future cash flows divided by the initial outflow and reported a computed value (1.22) used in decision-making, showing conceptual understanding across Represent, Implement, and Validate. However, treatment is not thorough: there’s no detailed calculation or scenario-based PI analysis, and minor imprecision appears (“1.22 years” and “$122 per $1”).

- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student conducted internal validation (calculating NPV, IRR, scenario and sensitivity analyses) but provided no external validation or comparison to named external sources/tools as required by the criterion. Under the category-specific standards (moderate), absence of explicit external references means the criterion is not met.

This demonstrates thorough integration of technology with finance across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations despite minor inconsistencies.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual grasp of NPV, identifies the discount rate, builds incremental cash flows, computes NPV, and claims validation via the formula. However, details are sparse and there is a notable inconsistency in sensitivity results (NPV negative vs. “remains positive” under a 20% revenue drop), which weakens accuracy and thoroughness. This supports a correct-but-basic treatment, not a comprehensive one.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV>0, reject if NPV<0) and applies it in multiple scenarios, showing conceptual understanding. However, contradictory statements (e.g., claiming both negative and positive NPV under the same sensitivity and rejecting despite a positive base-case NPV) indicate gaps and inconsistency, preventing a thorough PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student neither computes nor states an IRR value and shows a misconception by implying IRR is calculated “using the WACC,” rather than as the discount rate that makes NPV zero. References to IRR are only qualitative (“goes down”) without definition, method, or results, failing to demonstrate even basic conceptual accuracy for this criterion."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately described NPV as discounting future cash flows (including terminal value and WC recovery) and netting the initial outlay, then implemented and reported a concrete NPV result. They validated the method against standard practice and explored sensitivity, demonstrating thorough, conceptually sound treatment suitable for a PASS in a moderate category.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule by concluding accept in the base case when NPV > 0 and acknowledging that downside scenarios produce negative NPV, signaling non-acceptance. They also connect NPV to hurdle/IRR and discuss sensitivity, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound application across scenarios.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly describes FCF construction: computing operating cash flow (after tax, adding back depreciation) and incorporating capex and working capital changes at the correct times, then references annual FCF outputs. This demonstrates strong conceptual understanding and application across Represent and Implement stages, meeting a thorough PASS for this criterion.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted IRR in multiple scenarios and linked it to NPV behavior and the hurdle rate, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation/solution approach, so coverage is correct but not deep enough for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and reports both simple and discounted payback periods and includes the full initial outlay, demonstrating accurate determination of payback. However, the treatment is brief with no year-by-year cumulative demonstration or discussion of implications/thresholds, so the coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and reported the profitability index (1.242) based on discounted cash flows at the stated WACC, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment, nor demonstrate or explain the calculation steps or implications, so coverage is correct but not thorough."

STRENGTHS:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, accurate grasp of NPV by defining the discount rate, constructing all relevant cash flows, and applying discounting via an NPV profile and discounted payback. Multiple applications (NPV profile, scenario NPV, terminal tax effects) show thorough treatment beyond surface-level, satisfying the criterion at a PASS level.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies the NPV decision rule thoroughly: accepts when NPV is positive at the 8.5% WACC and recognizes rejection when NPV turns negative under a 20% revenue drop. The NPV profile demonstrates understanding of the threshold where the project becomes unacceptable (~13% discount rate). This coverage across scenarios and decision making satisfies a strong conceptual grasp.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly incorporates operating cash flow (NOPAT + depreciation), subtracts initial capex and working capital investment, and includes working capital recovery and after-tax salvage at exit—capturing FCF as OCF less capex and working capital changes. While there’s a minor wording slip on the tax shield percentage, the structure and specifics demonstrate a strong, thorough grasp consistent with a PASS under moderate standards.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual understanding of IRR by using an NPV profile and identifying the approximate zero-NPV rate (~13%). However, they do not explicitly compute or present the IRR value nor clearly state the formal definition (the discount rate that makes NPV = 0), and the treatment lacks depth and detailed calculation. Thus, the coverage supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the discounted payback concept and identifies the breakeven crossing around a little after year 8, showing basic understanding. However, the validation claims a simple payback of 4–5 years and incorrectly says it aligns with the chart, creating a contradiction and accuracy gap. Limited numerical detail further prevents a thorough treatment, so this merits PARTIAL, not PASS.
- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not calculate or conceptually discuss the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While they compute and analyze NPV, IRR, and payback, there is no PI metric or explanation, which is required for this criterion. Therefore, despite solid DCF work, this criterion is not met."
