  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a base case and multiple sensitivities (revenue ±20%, WACC ±2%) and explicitly interpreted outcomes, noting that a 20% revenue decline would reverse the investment recommendation. This satisfies the criterion (base plus sensitivity and identification of the breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts) with an appropriate conceptual discussion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly defines the problem, names the stakeholder, and gives objectives/inputs at the start (Discover), then states the modeling plan (Represent) afterward. This meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be documented before modeling, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documented a clear pre-implementation plan (models, metrics, scenarios, and input data) and then followed through with implemented artifacts and results (cash-flow analysis and specific NPV/IRR/payback values), satisfying the moderate DRIVER implementation standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, tax shield benefits, financial distress/flexibility costs, or compare buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. All DRIVER stages are focused on a Starbucks project NPV analysis, not the specified criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides only project valuation mechanics and qualitative business context; there is no discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and no treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. Given the criterion requires explicit agency-conflict analysis even at a conceptual level, the evidence supports a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes how debt vs. equity affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy risk and coverage ratios. WACC sensitivity and cash-flow payback are not substitutes for leverage math or risk coverage analysis, so the criterion is not met.",
