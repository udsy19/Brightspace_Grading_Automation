  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV > 0 (value creation) and reject when NPV < 0, and explicitly uses it for the base case and a downside scenario. They extend this with sensitivity to discount rate, indicating broader application. This demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp sufficient for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a comprehensive, systematic investment evaluation: defines inputs, lays out cash-flow construction, computes and interprets NPV/IRR/PI/payback, and performs scenario analysis on key drivers. Evidence across Discover, Implement, and Evolve shows application of a full framework, satisfying a thorough treatment under moderate strictness despite minor phrasing and numerical imprecision.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the investment question, provides the key financial inputs (cash flows, costs, tax, terminal value, WACC), and states the decision criteria and planned analyses (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity tests). This clear, explicit articulation meets the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified NPV components (discount rate, initial investment, OCF = NI + depreciation, working capital changes, terminal value) and reported an NPV used for decision-making, with sensitivity discussion. However, the treatment lacks detailed derivation and contains inconsistent NPV figures, so coverage is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported an IRR (13.25%) and used it appropriately by comparing to the hurdle rate and discussing sensitivity, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate the computation process, leaving coverage shallow for this criterion. Hence, Partial rather than Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies both simple and discounted payback years, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the treatment is brief, lacks cumulative cash flow support, and includes a muddled explanation around year 6–9, falling short of a thorough, well-explained derivation. Hence, this meets a basic but incomplete standard for a PARTIAL.",
