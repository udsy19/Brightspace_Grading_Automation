  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong conceptual and applied grasp of NPV: they construct free cash flows, correctly include initial investment and working capital, apply an 8.5% WACC to discount cash flows, and incorporate terminal value and WC recovery. Sensitivity analysis and an NPV vs. WACC chart further show depth beyond a basic mention, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule—positive NPV implies acceptance—and explicitly connects it to shareholder value. Sensitivity analysis on WACC and revenues demonstrates understanding of how NPV drives the decision. The Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages collectively show a thorough, applied grasp suitable for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code blocks, describes what each cell does (cash flow schedule then metric calculations), and reports/validates NPV (MPV) and IRR results with concrete validation checks on cash flow timing and depreciation. This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, and ownership.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and referenced IRR appropriately and interpreted it versus WACC, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show the zero-NPV point/method, falling short of a thorough treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and claims to compute both simple and discounted payback, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide the actual payback period or explain the calculation steps/threshold year, so depth and specificity are lacking for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and computes the Profitability Index conceptually (PI > 1) and acknowledges discounting via WACC, indicating present value awareness. However, they do not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment nor show the calculation details or components, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.
