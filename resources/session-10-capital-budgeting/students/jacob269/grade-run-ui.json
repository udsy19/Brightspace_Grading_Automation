  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly verbalized executing the code (running cells) and provided specific validation checks tying assumptions (depreciation schedule, timing of flows, terminal/WC recovery) to the stated results (positive NPV, IRR > WACC). The combination of execution statements, concrete checks, and sensitivity analysis demonstrates thorough confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, stakeholder (Starbucks), and objectives up front and then describes planning \"before coding,\" demonstrating the Discover stage was completed and documented prior to modeling. Therefore the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly described the model timeline, key inputs, and target metrics before coding and placed assumptions for sensitivity testing, then implemented those elements in organized code cells and scenario runs. This systematic plan-to-implementation linkage satisfies the REPRESENT criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of capital structure trade-offs, no quantification of tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs, and no comparison of buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Even under moderate standards, the criterion is missing rather than conceptually addressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify stakeholder winners/losers or divergent incentives, and it does not discuss asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. It remains strictly a capital budgeting analysis, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk; no leverage math or coverage metrics are provided. Content centers on capital budgeting (NPV/IRR) and operating risk, not financing structure. Under moderate standards, absence of conceptual discussion warrants a fail.",
