  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly performed sensitivity analysis by varying debt/equity assumptions, produced results for three scenarios, recalculated and validated outputs, and visualized the relationship. Those concrete steps across Represent/Implement/Validate meet the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly built and documented scenario models (three distinct capital-structure cases), computed WACC outcomes, and validated results by recalculation and cross-comparison. Their transcript shows explicit representation, implementation, and validation steps, meeting the strict requirement for personal execution and methodological clarity.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student performed multiple what-if scenarios (new debt issuance, three capital structure mixes) with numeric outcomes and acknowledged non-linear effects (U-shaped WACC at high leverage). They extended sensitivity into strategic risk scenarios (content geography) and linked to potential capital restructuring. This breadth and depth across DRIVER stages meets a thorough, dynamic scenario and sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never calculates or conceptually discusses NPV. While it thoroughly treats WACC, there is no evidence of discounting future cash flows or subtracting an initial outlay, which is required for this criterion. Under moderate strictness, absence of any NPV treatment results in a fail.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on WACC, capital structure, and tax shields but does not articulate the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0 using the appropriate discount rate) or apply it to any project. Across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, there is no NPV calculation or explicit accept/reject logic, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: There is no discussion or calculation related to IRR or the NPV=0 condition. Given the moderate standard, some conceptual treatment of IRR would suffice, but it is entirely absent; the submission centers solely on WACC.",
