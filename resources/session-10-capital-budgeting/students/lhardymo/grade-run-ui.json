  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (three capital-structure cases with explicit WACC outcomes) and discussed the U-shaped/tipping-point behavior where additional debt reverses benefits—meeting the requirement to highlight breakpoints where preferences/implications shift. Their workflow included representation, implementation, and validation steps, showing both conceptual and executed sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran and reran the calculation and confirmed matching results, and they verbally explain key assumptions (after‑tax cost of debt, tax shield) that account for the observed numeric outcomes. This clear execution confirmation plus consistent explanatory logic meets the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes what the charts show (U-shaped WACC vs. debt) and verbally walks through tables/scenarios with units and specific values (percentages, dollar example), explaining capital structure trade-offs. Multiple visuals and scenarios are discussed with concrete numbers, meeting the moderate standard with thorough coverage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: While the student quantified the tax shield conceptually and recalculated WACC after debt issuance, they did not evaluate the trade-off across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor quantify distress/flexibility (optionality) costs. They also failed to connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile, focusing instead on Netflix/Disney/Amazon.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on WACC mechanics, tax shields, and comparative WACC levels, but does not analyze who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics (e.g., shareholder-bondholder conflicts under higher leverage or buybacks). Therefore, it fails to meet the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on WACC and tax shields with general statements about “more risk” at higher debt, but it does not discuss or compute DFL, nor link financing choice to ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given these gaps, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
