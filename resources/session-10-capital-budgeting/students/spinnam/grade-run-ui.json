  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly stated they ran code (Colab notebook) and provided multiple, specific validation checks that link assumptions to outputs (depreciation sum, year‑0 outflow, NPV≈0 at IRR, sensitivity runs). These concrete tests and the articulated assumptions demonstrate thorough verification of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated what the charts/tables showed (NPV, IRR, payback, PI) and explicitly stated units and scenarios (millions of dollars, percentages, years; WACC at 6.5/8.5/10.5; −20% revenue). Multiple visuals/scenarios were verbally interpreted, meeting the criterion at a thorough level under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student conducted built-in sensitivity/stress tests on key drivers (WACC and revenue) and clearly explained how outcomes shift the project’s risk profile and potential go/no-go decision (robust to WACC, fragile to demand). Evidence spans multiple DRIVER stages and includes concrete results and implications, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment for this moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off, provides no quantification of tax shield benefits or expected distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, and makes no connection to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. The content stays within Starbucks project capital budgeting, with only a generic corporate tax rate, thus failing this criterion under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identifies divergent incentives or who gains/loses under different financing or payout choices. It also lacks any discussion of leverage, buybacks, asset substitution, or risk-shifting dynamics. Given the total absence of this required conceptual content, the criterion fails despite otherwise solid DRIVER execution.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address leverage math (DFL) or how debt vs equity changes EPS/ROE volatility, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The analysis focuses on project NPV/IRR and demand sensitivity under a given WACC, with only a generic mention of capital structure. Hence it fails this criterion.",
