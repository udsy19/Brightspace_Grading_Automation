  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly articulated the NPV formula, correctly included initial investment, discounted operating cash flows, and terminal/working capital recovery at the WACC, and implemented it in code with a specific NPV result. Validation via IRR zero-check and sensitivity to discount rate shows strong conceptual and applied understanding, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied the NPV decision rule: they defined the correct discount rate, computed a positive NPV and recommended acceptance, and showed that a negative NPV under a downside scenario would imply rejection. Sensitivity and validation steps demonstrate depth beyond a basic mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR but explicitly validated the defining property that NPV equals zero at the IRR, demonstrating strong conceptual accuracy. They implemented a numerical solver and reported results, with validation steps that satisfy a knowledgeable reviewer, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly determined both simple and discounted payback and briefly interpreted timing, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic—no detailed methodology, cumulative cash-flow demonstration, or deeper discussion of implications—so it falls short of a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding of PI and applies it (PI > 1; “for every $1 invested...”); they also implemented it in code. However, they do not present the formula or detailed calculation, and report inconsistent values (1.2 vs 1.24) alongside a misstated initial outlay, indicating incomplete/thin treatment. Thus, correct but basic → PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the OCF concept via OCF = NI + Depreciation and explicitly computes EBIT and taxes, which aligns with EBIT × (1–T) + Depreciation when no interest is included. However, they do not provide a detailed, explicit demonstration of the EBIT × (1–T) + Dep formula or a numerical example, so the treatment is correct but not thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents capex, depreciation method, and cost line items and validates internal arithmetic, showing correct treatment of construction/real-estate cash flows. However, they do not justify how the $12M (or other cost figures) were estimated or benchmarked nor test sensitivity to capex/terminal value assumptions, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently justified or comprehensive."
