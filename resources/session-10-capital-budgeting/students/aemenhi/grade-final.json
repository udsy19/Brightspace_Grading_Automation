  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV, detailing discounting of annual cash flows at WACC and inclusion of key elements (initial outlay, working capital timing, terminal value, depreciation tax effects). They compute and interpret a specific NPV and perform sensitivity analyses. This depth and correct application across DRIVER stages meets a PASS standard despite minor inconsistencies elsewhere.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains the NPV decision rule and applies it correctly: discounting at WACC, interpreting negative NPV as value destruction, and recommending rejection. They reinforce this across stages with sensitivity and reflection, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately identified and computed both simple and discounted payback periods and interpreted their implications. They described the computation approach (cumulative cash flows), produced concrete results, and contextualized them, demonstrating a strong conceptual grasp appropriate for a moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The reported IRR (94.94%) is inconsistent with a negative NPV at 8.5% and the conventional single sign-change cash-flow pattern, indicating an incorrect IRR computation and a misunderstanding (mislabeling cash flows as non-conventional). While the student mentions calculating IRR, they do not correctly compute or interpret “the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero,” thus failing this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding that OCF comes from after-tax EBIT with depreciation added back, and integrates this in the implementation and validation stages. However, wording is inconsistent (refers to “depreciation tax shield” instead of clearly using EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation) and lacks explicit numerical demonstration, so coverage is solid but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly recognizes and includes both salvage value and working capital recovery and notes that terminal value should be taxed. However, the validation shows a terminal inflow seemingly adding $3.0M salvage + $0.5M WC without explicit tax, and the depreciation discussion conflicts (full $12M vs. “net salvage” base), leaving ambiguity on correct tax treatment. This demonstrates correct but incomplete handling, warranting PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents numeric assumptions (initial investment, working capital, depreciation, COGS, labor, rent, tax rate, terminal value) and shows how they are used in the model (Discover/Represent/Implement/Validate). However, they do not justify or validate the magnitude of the real estate/construction cost itself (no breakdown, market comparables, or sensitivity on the initial $12M), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

The depth, use of concrete figures, and explicit DRIVER-stage reflections meet the threshold for a thorough, executive-ready communication."
