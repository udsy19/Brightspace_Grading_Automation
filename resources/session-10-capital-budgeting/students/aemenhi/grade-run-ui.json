  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the code was generated and confirmed, describes running validation steps, presents concrete output values (NPV, IRR, sensitivity NPVs), and links those results back to key assumptions (e.g., large terminal inflow causing anomalous IRR). This demonstrates thorough verbal confirmation of code execution and reasoned validation, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and repeatedly describes what the charts show (cash flow timing/magnitudes; NPV sensitivity vs discount rate) and ties them to decision trade-offs. They also verbalize scenario dimensions and units (WACC ±2%, revenue −20%, dollar NPVs). This is thorough and aligns with DRIVER stages that plan, build, and interpret visual outputs.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student integrates explicit sensitivity tests (revenue/FCF variability and discount rate), rebuilds the model per scenario, and interprets how results affect risk and the accept/reject decision (NPV remains negative; project is fragile to revenue). While tax-rate sensitivity isn’t shown, the treatment is thorough for a moderate standard, with concrete numbers, visuals, and clear implications across multiple DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss the capital structure trade-off (interest tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs) or evaluate buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, and it does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Mentions of a depreciation tax shield and WACC relate to project evaluation, not capital structure policy. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing or payout choices, or how leverage/buybacks create asset substitution and risk-shifting. Despite thorough DRIVER-led capital budgeting work, the criterion is missing entirely, so the student fails this specific standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on capital budgeting (NPV, IRR, payback, WACC sensitivity) and never discusses financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage ratios. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but this criterion is essentially missing; therefore, it fails.",
