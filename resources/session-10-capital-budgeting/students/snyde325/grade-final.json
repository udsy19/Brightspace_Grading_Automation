  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined NPV, explained discounting, and applied it by building discounted cash flows including terminal value and working capital, then computing and interpreting NPV across base and sensitivity scenarios. The discussion includes decision rules and implications, demonstrating thorough conceptual understanding consistent with a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule and applies it across multiple scenarios (base, revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), using it to make explicit accept/reject judgments. The reflection ties the rule to a clear recommendation and highlights a negative-NPV case as a failure, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly addressed payback by defining it, computing both simple and discounted payback with correct reasoning, and interpreting implications for risk and value timing. The DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages collectively show accurate determination and nuanced discussion, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and applies it by computing and comparing it to the hurdle rate, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic and includes a notable accuracy error (“313%” described as below 8.5%), preventing a thorough, error-free demonstration. Hence, Partial rather than Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines PI and indicates they plan to calculate it, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not present any PI calculations or discuss results/implications, resulting in incomplete and non-thorough treatment. Hence, this meets a basic standard but falls short of a full PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: Student correctly performed and discussed scenario-based NPV sensitivity to revenue and WACC, demonstrating conceptual understanding. But they did not provide a dedicated visualization of NPV sensitivity (e.g., tornado chart or NPV vs. driver plots); the only chart shown was a cash flow chart. Under moderate standards, this merits partial credit for correct analysis without the required visualization depth.",
