  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reports numeric NPVs/IRRs and paybacks for each, and explicitly identifies the revenue -20% breakpoint where NPV flips negative and stakeholder decision would change. The DRIVER stages (implement + validate) corroborate that the analysis was executed and interpreted, satisfying a thorough treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code in Colab, inspects the generated output, and verbally validates that the cash flow schedule and summary metrics match the problem assumptions. They also articulate the key assumptions and show how those drive NPV/IRR/payback results, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated the visual outputs, specifying units (“in millions”), colors, and year-by-year bars, and explicitly discussed scenario setups and results. They tied visuals to stakeholder impacts and capital allocation decisions (NPV/IRR vs. hurdle rate, investor value, payback risk). The depth and clarity meet the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. While taxes and depreciation are mentioned, there is no quantification of capital structure tax shields, distress/optionality costs, or any Apple-specific analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. While the DRIVER stages are used for NPV/IRR analysis, there is no substantive treatment of who gains/loses under alternative financing or payout choices, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes financing choices or degree of financial leverage, nor links leverage to ROE/EPS volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk. Evidence shows a purely unlevered analysis that explicitly excludes financing effects and offers no coverage metrics or DFL math, which is required for this criterion.",
