So 00:00:05.600 to start off, I put the assignment into 00:00:09.840 Gemini using the prompt create a Python 00:00:12.400 code that answers the assignment. Use 00:00:13.759 the kiss principle and driver method to 00:00:16.239 make it super easy to understand and 00:00:17.920 teach to someone with a little financial 00:00:20.400 knowledge. It popped out all this 00:00:23.439 information and the code that I need. 00:00:26.560 And then um so what we're finding today, 00:00:29.359 so Starbucks wants to build a new 00:00:31.199 rotisserie. We need to decide if 00:00:34.320 spending $12 million today is a smart 00:00:36.880 financial move based on the cash it will 00:00:39.120 generate over the 10 years. So some 00:00:42.239 input. So this is just from the 00:00:43.680 assignment over here. So we have our 00:00:46.160 initial investment which is the 00:00:47.840 equipment, working capital, installation 00:00:50.719 cost, training um which is $12 million. 00:00:56.320 um at year zero 00:00:59.280 and then it's going to depreciate 00:01:00.719 slightly a straight line over 10 years. 00:01:03.039 And then working capital is $500,000 00:01:06.159 money set aside in year zero recovered 00:01:08.400 in year 10. The WACC is the hurdle rate 00:01:12.400 which would be 8.5%. So the interest we 00:01:14.799 need to beat revenue so year 1 is 8 00:01:18.159 million, year 2 to 5 is 11. Year 6 to 10 00:01:22.000 is 9 million. Our operating costs are 00:01:24.080 the cost of goods sold at 40% of 00:01:25.840 revenue. Labor 2.5 million a year. Rent 00:01:28.960 and utilities is8 00:01:31.280 million a year. Marketing is.3 million 00:01:34.079 in year 1. Then.1 million in years 2 to 00:01:37.119 10. Depreciation like I said the 12 00:01:40.159 million is lost over 10 years. So 1.2 00:01:42.799 million a year to lower taxes but is not 00:01:44.799 a cash expense. Then our taxes are the 00:01:48.399 corporate rate which is 25% and then 00:01:50.720 terminal value which is the pro uh the 00:01:53.040 project is worth $3 million at the end 00:01:54.640 of year 10. And then some key concepts 00:01:57.840 that we'll just need to know for um just 00:02:00.719 to understand this assignment. So the 00:02:03.200 net present value which is the present 00:02:04.880 value of project cash flows minus the 00:02:07.600 initial investment. So that's this 00:02:10.479 lovely equation over here. And then if 00:02:13.200 the net present value is greater than 00:02:14.640 zero we accept the project. So it 00:02:17.040 creates shareholder value. If it is less 00:02:19.440 than zero, we reject the project. It 00:02:22.000 destroys shareholder value. And if it's 00:02:24.080 equal to zero, it's indifferent and it 00:02:25.680 earns exactly the cost of the capital. 00:02:28.000 The IRR, which is the internal rate of 00:02:30.400 return, is the discount rate that makes 00:02:32.480 NPV equal zero. Payback period is the 00:02:35.519 time required to recover initial 00:02:37.440 investment. Probability index or PI is 00:02:40.879 the present value of cash flows divided 00:02:42.879 by the initial investment. The hurdle 00:02:45.440 rate or the WACC is um the minimal 00:02:48.879 acceptable return. Operating cash flows 00:02:52.879 is after tax operating income plus 00:02:54.959 depreciation and the terminal terminal 00:02:58.160 cash flow is the asset sale value plus 00:03:01.519 working capital recovery. 00:03:04.400 Okay. So our plan is to solve this we 00:03:08.400 will build a cash flow schedule. So like 00:03:11.040 a think of this like a checkbook 00:03:13.120 register for the project. So we're going 00:03:15.440 to calculate the operating profit. So 00:03:17.440 money coming in which is the revenue 00:03:19.040 minus money going out which is the cost 00:03:20.879 and depreciation. We're going to 00:03:22.879 calculate taxes. So the government takes 00:03:24.879 25% of the profit. And then we're going 00:03:27.599 to find the free cash flow. Um so we're 00:03:30.400 going to take the profit after tax, add 00:03:32.480 back depreciation because we didn't 00:03:35.280 actually write a check for it each year 00:03:37.360 and subtract the initial investments. 00:03:39.360 And then discounting we will shrink 00:03:40.959 future dollars to today's value because 00:03:43.200 a dollar today is worth more than a 00:03:44.799 dollar in 10 years because of inflation 00:03:46.560 and opportunity cost. 00:03:48.959 So implementing this I copied this 00:03:52.799 Python code to collab and 00:03:56.879 I will run it for you 00:04:01.200 to show you that it works. 00:04:04.159 And um 00:04:06.799 we get this lovely output which we will 00:04:10.480 go over later and then this extra 00:04:13.040 section which I added later on. Um but 00:04:16.720 so we're starting off with this code we 00:04:19.358 have define and discover. So in discover 00:04:21.440 so this is just all the inputs from the 00:04:24.240 assignment. So tax rate years WACCC 00:04:27.440 initial investment working capital 00:04:29.199 terminal value and our depreciation. And 00:04:31.759 so that's everything from the assignment 00:04:33.600 given 00:04:35.360 um implementing. So we're building our 00:04:38.080 cash flows by year. Um so we're just 00:04:41.199 determining our revenue and expenses. 00:04:44.639 Like I said, cost of goods sold, labor, 00:04:46.320 rent, marketing stuff we already know 00:04:47.919 from the assignment. 00:04:49.919 Next, we're calculating the operating 00:04:52.720 income or the EBIT they're going to call 00:04:55.120 it in this. And then opex is going to be 00:04:59.280 our operating expense. So that's cost of 00:05:01.759 goods sold, labor, rent, and marketing 00:05:03.280 added together. And then IBIDA is 00:05:06.320 revenue minus the operating expense. So 00:05:09.199 IBIDA is the earnings before interest, 00:05:11.039 taxes, and amorization. And it measures 00:05:14.080 the company's operating profitability. 00:05:17.199 That excludes the effects of financing 00:05:19.680 decisions or their interest, tax 00:05:22.160 obligations, and amorization of 00:05:24.000 intangible assets. And then we have our 00:05:27.600 depreciation per year. And then the EBIT 00:05:31.280 will be our so our operating income will 00:05:35.440 be the IBIDA minus the depreciation 00:05:39.199 and then taxes and NOAT. So the tax will 00:05:44.080 be the operating income times the tax 00:05:46.800 rate. Then NOAT is the net operating 00:05:50.080 profit after tax and it just shows the 00:05:52.160 company's profitability from the 00:05:54.400 business operations independent of the 00:05:57.199 capital structure. So this will be the 00:05:58.960 operating income minus the tax. Then 00:06:02.240 we're going on to the operating cash 00:06:03.919 flow 00:06:05.919 which is yeah you got that which is the 00:06:08.639 not min plus the depreciation cash flow 00:06:11.520 adjustments. So using our initial 00:06:14.240 investment working capital and terminal 00:06:15.840 value we're going to find working 00:06:17.759 capital term terminal value after tax 00:06:21.199 total free cash flow present value we 00:06:24.080 already know this um and then we're 00:06:26.800 going to calculate it all and help us 00:06:29.120 find the payback period 00:06:31.759 and then we're going to find our 00:06:34.000 profitability index or PI 00:06:38.080 and then oh also it's going to find our 00:06:39.840 net present value which is up here 00:06:43.440 and then yeah all this other stuff it's 00:06:45.280 going to return as well and then our 00:06:47.520 sensit sensitivity analysis it wants us 00:06:49.840 to do the base case and then um revenue 00:06:52.800 down 20% and then when the WACCC changes 00:06:57.520 um plus or minus I want to say it was 2% 00:07:00.720 from the assignment 00:07:02.639 and then um then it's going to reflect 00:07:05.840 and report on whether um we should 00:07:09.280 accept or reject the project and then 00:07:12.800 it's going to come out with a 00:07:14.000 recommendation and a risk assessment 00:07:16.240 which we'll get into and it's going to 00:07:17.840 generate a chart that will explain the 00:07:20.319 cash flows a little bit better. Um so 00:07:23.599 into 00:07:25.440 everything that results. So the first is 00:07:28.240 our base case cash flow schedule in 00:07:30.400 millions. So year zero is -12.5 cash 00:07:35.120 flow. So this is the hole we dig. So, we 00:07:37.680 spent $12 million on building equipment 00:07:40.000 and set aside $500,000 for working 00:07:42.960 capital, which is our inventory, our 00:07:44.960 cash, and registers. 00:07:46.960 Year 2 was 1.2 plus 1.2. Um, so we made 00:07:51.759 profit, but marketing costs were high at 00:07:54.240 300,000. 00:07:56.000 Year 2 through five was the same at plus 00:07:59.120 2.7 million. So, this was like our prime 00:08:01.120 years. Revenue is high at 11 million 00:08:05.280 over here. and marketing dropped to 00:08:08.319 100K. 00:08:10.000 So, we're generating our maximum cash. 00:08:12.319 Then year 6 through 9, that's also 1.8 00:08:15.840 million for cash flow. And then our 00:08:18.960 revenue dips to 9 million over here. And 00:08:22.240 then it's as predicted in the prompt. So 00:08:24.720 cash flow slows down. And then year 10 00:08:28.000 was $4.55 million for the free cash 00:08:31.520 flow. And this is like our exit. So we 00:08:33.839 get to the normal 1.8. 8 million 00:08:36.719 operating cash plus we sell the project 00:08:39.599 so the terminal value of $3 million and 00:08:41.919 recover the working capital at half a 00:08:44.240 million. 00:08:45.760 Okay. And next is our scenario 00:08:47.200 comparison. 00:08:48.880 Um so we have um the net present value 00:08:54.720 which was sorry we're going over our 00:08:57.040 base case for our scenario our revenue 00:08:59.120 minus 20% earn our WACCC 6.5% WACC 00:09:03.920 10.5%. 00:09:05.839 Um and then so the net present value 00:09:08.399 over here. So if this was 2,690,879. 00:09:14.240 So this just is meaning after we pay 00:09:15.760 back the 12 million investment and 00:09:17.200 recover the 8.5 00:09:19.519 um interest in the WACCC, 00:09:22.720 then um to our investors, we effectively 00:09:25.440 walked away with an extra $2.69 00:09:28.320 million in value. Um so this verdict is 00:09:32.560 passed. So any positive number is good 00:09:34.480 in this scenario. So the only one um bad 00:09:38.399 would be technically the revenue being 00:09:40.880 at - 20%. The other ones are good 00:09:43.200 because they're all positive. And then 00:09:45.120 the IRR, the internal rate of return for 00:09:47.839 this first one, it's at 12.84%. 00:09:50.720 So this just means the project acts like 00:09:52.320 a savings account paying 12.84 84% in 00:09:55.600 interest. So pass since 12.84 84 is 00:09:59.200 higher than our cost of borrowing money 00:10:00.880 at 8.5%. So this is profitable use of 00:10:04.640 funds. Um so only one that wouldn't be 00:10:07.279 profitable would be the revenue which is 00:10:09.920 minus 20% because it is below the 8.5 of 00:10:13.279 our borrowing money percent wise 00:10:16.000 payback. So this is our simple payback. 00:10:18.320 Um so 5.3 years meaning it takes roughly 00:10:21.760 5 years and 4 months to get our nominal 00:10:25.760 $12.5 million back. So this is moderate 00:10:28.800 risk roughly. 00:10:30.720 Um and then 00:10:33.839 discounted payback. I actually had to 00:10:35.920 calculate that. Um I went into Gemini 00:10:38.560 and I cuz it didn't come out in my code. 00:10:40.800 So I went into Gemini. I asked it to add 00:10:42.720 a discounted payback period and um so it 00:10:47.040 said to calculate and it's going to go 00:10:49.440 through create a break even point and 00:10:51.920 whatnot. Um so the discounted payback 00:10:54.480 period is 8.2 years. So meaning when we 00:10:57.839 account for inflation and interest time 00:10:59.839 value of money um it actually takes 8.2 00:11:02.480 years to break even. So this means it's 00:11:04.640 high risk and we are only truly making 00:11:06.640 money for the shareholders in the final 00:11:09.040 1.8 years of our project. 00:11:13.839 And um next we go in to 00:11:19.360 obviously more scenario analysis over 00:11:21.440 here. So, with revenue being 20% and the 00:11:25.440 NPV being negative 00:11:28.640 $3 million roughly, um, this is like a 00:11:32.079 failure because if customers don't show 00:11:33.760 up and sales drop 20%, we lose $3 00:11:35.920 million and then the IRR drops to 313% 00:11:39.600 which is far below 8.5% requirement for 00:11:42.959 the WCC being at 6.5%. 00:11:46.399 So, we have a positive MPV of roughly 00:11:50.399 4.2 $2 million. 00:11:53.440 So this is our best case. So if interest 00:11:55.200 rates drop, the project looks even 00:11:56.959 better because future money is worth 00:11:58.560 more today. And then for the WACC at 00:12:01.760 10.5%. 00:12:03.760 And our NPV is roughly $1.35 million. 00:12:08.240 This is safe bet because even if money 00:12:10.000 gets more expensive and our interest 00:12:12.000 rates rise, the project will still make 00:12:13.519 a profit of $1.35 million. And then our 00:12:17.760 recommendation is to accept based off of 00:12:20.480 this. So the rational was the project um 00:12:23.519 generates a positive MPV of 2,69 00:12:27.920 um $690,800.79 00:12:30.560 and the IRR of 12.84% is exceeding the 00:12:34.000 hurdle rate of 8.5%. 00:12:37.920 Um so the project clears the hurdle rate 00:12:40.000 of 12.84% 84% being greater than 8.5% 00:12:43.839 and creates a positive um NPV and value. 00:12:48.320 So the big warning here in our risk 00:12:50.079 assessment is the revenue sensitivity. 00:12:52.880 So if value drops 20% MPV becomes 00:12:55.839 negative $3 million and the critical 00:12:58.399 risk is the project is highly sensitive 00:13:00.240 to revenue misses. a pro a 20% drops 00:13:03.920 turns NPV negative then cost of capital 00:13:07.600 even if WACCC rises to 10.5% NPV is 00:13:12.800 roughly $135 million 00:13:17.200 um so the big warning the risk 00:13:19.040 assessment output explicitly flags the 00:13:21.600 project as critical risk regarding the 00:13:23.519 revenue so we should accept the project 00:13:25.920 management must be 100% sure that they 00:13:28.079 can hit those sales targets because 00:13:29.760 missing them by 20% % turns this into a 00:13:33.360 bad investment. 00:13:35.279 And then 00:13:36.959 um going into our cash flow chart 00:13:41.040 generated down here. So this is just a 00:13:44.399 story of the investment over the 10 00:13:45.920 years and um red is the negative cash 00:13:49.360 flow and green is the positive cash 00:13:51.360 flow. So being at year zero it extends 00:13:54.240 to 12.5 million. So, this is like the 00:13:56.399 buyin period represents cash leaving the 00:13:59.120 bank account immediately to pay for the 00:14:00.800 building. Um, equipment being $12 00:14:03.040 million in inventory and cash to open 00:14:05.839 the store is at um half a million. Year 00:14:08.800 two is the positive 1.2 million. So, the 00:14:11.680 store was profitable. Bar is short 00:14:13.680 because you spent a lot of money on 00:14:15.120 marketing, which is 300,000 to launch 00:14:17.360 the store and revenues were only 8 00:14:19.279 million, which is lower than the peak. 00:14:21.680 Years 2 through 5 were considered like 00:14:23.680 the prime years. um because they're four 00:14:26.399 identical green bars and they all are at 00:14:28.639 $2.7 million each. So the store is 00:14:31.040 running at full speed. Revenue is $1 00:14:32.880 million. Marketing costs have dropped to 00:14:34.800 the maintenance level of 100k and bars 00:14:37.680 represent the cash cow phase as well. 00:14:40.639 And then years 6 through 9 they suddenly 00:14:43.760 drop a little bit to 1.8 million and 00:14:45.680 stay. So this is because the assumption 00:14:48.480 that after 5 years excitement wears off 00:14:50.800 and revenue drops from 11 million to 9 00:14:53.360 million. So the cash flow shrinks. Year 00:14:56.079 10, highest green bar spiking to 4.55 00:15:00.320 million. 00:15:02.480 This is high because the normal profit 00:15:04.560 from selling coffee at 1.8 million and 00:15:08.000 then also the cash you get from selling 00:15:09.519 the business and building or the 00:15:10.800 terminal value and then recovery of the 00:15:13.680 $500,000 00:15:15.360 working capital you set aside in year 00:15:17.360 zero. 00:15:19.040 And then oh I forgot to also like run 00:15:22.000 this code as well. But like I said this 00:15:24.399 is how I calculated the discount payback 00:15:27.040 period um 00:15:29.839 discount of each flow to year zero for 00:15:32.399 the present value accumulated the sum of 00:15:34.639 the discounted flows and I found the 00:15:36.720 break even point which is the 8.2 years. 00:15:40.160 So that was that. 00:15:43.920 So validating this, the cash flow 00:15:46.240 schedule shows the initial outflow of 00:15:48.240 $12.5 million in the year zero and the 00:15:51.759 positive cash flows from operations in 00:15:53.600 the terminal value. In year 10, it 00:15:56.959 confirms it structural integrity of the 00:15:58.720 model. And then to evolve, we will test 00:16:02.399 um the two required scenarios like the 00:16:04.000 revenue reduced by 20% and the WACCC 00:16:07.360 is changed by plus or minus 2%. And then 00:16:10.000 we calculate the payback period. So the 00:16:12.560 simple payback ignores the time value of 00:16:14.880 money and it assumes that $1 in 5 years 00:16:17.040 is worth the same as $1 today. And then 00:16:20.399 also the discounted payback is more 00:16:22.079 accurate and rigorous because they 00:16:23.440 acknowledges that we need to cover our 00:16:25.040 costs in present value terms and it will 00:16:27.600 always be a longer number of years than 00:16:29.680 the simple payback. And then the break 00:16:32.160 even point. So simple payback would be I 00:16:35.600 spent $12 million and got 12 million 00:16:37.759 back in nominal dollars. while the 00:16:39.920 discounted payback is I spent $12 00:16:41.839 million and I finally earned back the 12 00:16:44.000 million plus the 8.5% annual return 00:16:46.639 required by the investors and then until 00:16:49.519 the year 8.2 2, which is the what the 00:16:53.920 number down here. Um, the project 00:16:56.160 technically hasn't earned anything for 00:16:57.680 the shareholders beyond their minimum 00:16:59.199 required return and has only been paying 00:17:01.600 back the mortgage or the principal plus 00:17:03.759 the interest of the initial investment 00:17:06.640 investment. And then this is just a high 00:17:09.199 risk indicator cuz the project lasts 10 00:17:11.439 years and the payback of 8.2 years is 00:17:14.559 risky because they're only clear for the 00:17:16.880 1.8 years left. And this means if it 00:17:19.520 shuts down early or revenue dips 00:17:21.439 significantly, they might not recover 00:17:23.199 from investment in the present value 00:17:25.839 terms and then the project is a 00:17:28.079 long-term play and the value is very 00:17:30.240 backloaded as well. And then reflecting 00:17:33.360 on this assignment, so financially the 00:17:37.200 base case results show a positive MPV 00:17:39.760 and a IRR significantly greater than 00:17:42.880 WACCC of 8.5%. 00:17:45.600 The MPV decision rule states that a 00:17:48.080 project with a positive MPV creates 00:17:49.840 value for the shareholders. So the 00:17:51.760 project is financially acceptable and 00:17:54.960 then decision based on the code assuming 00:17:56.640 positive MPV. Starbucks should accept 00:17:58.880 this. Why? Because NPV is positive 00:18:01.919 meaning the project generates more cash 00:18:03.440 than the 8.5 cost of capital it requires 00:18:06.320 and this has substantial shareholder 00:18:08.240 wealth and the return the IRR is also 00:18:11.120 higher than the 8.5% indicating high 00:18:13.600 efficiency. 00:18:15.120 Um looking at the risk we look at the 00:18:16.799 revenue drop by 20%. So if that number 00:18:19.120 is negative the project is risky and we 00:18:21.039 don't sell enough coffee we lose money. 00:18:23.200 So we must ensure the flagship nature 00:18:25.919 could creates enough brand halo effect 00:18:28.160 to justify the risk even if it's 00:18:30.080 financials get tight. Some next steps we 00:18:32.720 could do is secure the location and 00:18:34.480 begin the $12 million procurement 00:18:36.640 process for the equipment. also monitor 00:18:39.360 marketing spend strictly in year one to 00:18:41.840 ensure it drops to um $100,000 as 00:18:45.760 planned. 00:18:47.520 But that is it for my assignment. But 00:18:51.520 thank you",
