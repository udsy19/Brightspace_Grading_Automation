  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (20% revenue downside and WACC sweep) and quantifies impacts (NPV/IRR changes). The student explicitly identifies the breakpoint where value flips negative under revenue downside and links sensitivities to a recommendation with guardrails, demonstrating thorough, decision‑relevant scenario analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly indicates the code was run and presents numerical outputs generated by it, then verbally validates completeness and methodology and ties key modeling assumptions to those results. This demonstrates a thorough, coherent confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what each visualization shows, provides specific units (millions, percentages, years), and explains scenario results (20% revenue downside, WACC sweep). Multiple visuals are interpreted with implications for capital allocation decisions, satisfying a comprehensive, conceptually strong treatment under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project-level capital budgeting for Starbucks (NPV/IRR/WACC, sensitivity) and never analyzes capital structure trade-offs, tax shield of debt, distress or flexibility costs, or distribution policy alternatives. It also provides no linkage to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. Given the complete absence of the required topic, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of stakeholder incentive divergence (who gains/loses), agency conflicts, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks appears in the submission. The work focuses solely on project NPV/IRR and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, leaving the criterion unmet despite use of DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project valuation (NPV/IRR, WACC, demand sensitivity) and never discusses financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy/coverage considerations. Given the criterion’s requirements, there is no conceptual or quantitative treatment of leverage effects, so this merits a FAIL.",
