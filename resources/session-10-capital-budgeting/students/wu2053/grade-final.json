  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately described NPV as discounting future cash flows (including terminal value and WC recovery) and netting the initial outlay, then implemented and reported a concrete NPV result. They validated the method against standard practice and explored sensitivity, demonstrating thorough, conceptually sound treatment suitable for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule by concluding accept in the base case when NPV > 0 and acknowledging that downside scenarios produce negative NPV, signaling non-acceptance. They also connect NPV to hurdle/IRR and discuss sensitivity, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound application across scenarios.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly describes FCF construction: computing operating cash flow (after tax, adding back depreciation) and incorporating capex and working capital changes at the correct times, then references annual FCF outputs. This demonstrates strong conceptual understanding and application across Represent and Implement stages, meeting a thorough PASS for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted IRR in multiple scenarios and linked it to NPV behavior and the hurdle rate, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation/solution approach, so coverage is correct but not deep enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and reports both simple and discounted payback periods and includes the full initial outlay, demonstrating accurate determination of payback. However, the treatment is brief with no year-by-year cumulative demonstration or discussion of implications/thresholds, so the coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and reported the profitability index (1.242) based on discounted cash flows at the stated WACC, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment, nor demonstrate or explain the calculation steps or implications, so coverage is correct but not thorough.",

However, they did not justify the choice or source of the real estate/construction cost figures (e.g., why $12M capex or $3M terminal), nor provide detailed validation of those cost estimates, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
