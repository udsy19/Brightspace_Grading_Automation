  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the charts/tables show, citing specific values, trends, and units (millions of dollars, percentages, years). They also explain scenarios tied to the visual outputs (base case, +/- 2% WACC, -20% revenue), which clarifies capital allocation trade-offs. Evidence spans IMPLEMENT and EVOLVE stages, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the D-stage (problem statement, stakeholders, objectives) before describing modeling work, meeting the strict requirement for documenting Define & Discover prior to modeling. Evidence shows clear, up-front discovery followed by representation/implementation steps, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified models, scenarios, and metrics before coding and built the detailed cash-flow representation prior to implementation. They then executed the plan—running code, producing NPV/IRR/payback results and sensitivity analyses—demonstrating systematic linkage from representation to implemented artifacts.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. The only “tax shield” discussed is depreciation within a Starbucks project, not the interest tax shield from leverage. Thus, the criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identify who gains/loses under alternatives. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the complete absence of this content, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no leverage math (DFL, EPS/ROE effects) and explicitly models no interest, indicating no financing-choice analysis. It does not discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. While the DRIVER stages are evident for capital budgeting, they omit the required leverage-focused content, so this criterion fails.",
