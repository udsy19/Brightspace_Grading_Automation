  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule, explicitly linking positive NPV to value creation (accept) and negative NPV to value destruction (reject), and tests the rule across multiple scenarios (base, WACC ±2%, revenue −20%). Despite some inconsistent calculations elsewhere, the conceptual understanding and application are thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly constructed an incremental cash flow schedule and included all key project-only components (capex, changes in working capital, depreciation tax shield, terminal value) while correctly excluding financing costs. The treatment of working capital recovery and the detailed, year-by-year structure show comprehensive application, satisfying a thorough, conceptually accurate understanding for this criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly automated capital budgeting calculations by leveraging AI tools to build a model, generate code, compute key metrics (NPV, IRR, payback, PI), and run sensitivity analyses. Multiple automated outputs and visualizations show comprehensive application. Despite inconsistencies in results, the automation criterion is clearly met at a strong level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set up and applied the NPV framework (cash flows, WACC discounting, WC recovery, terminal value) and discussed sensitivity, showing conceptual understanding. However, base-case NPV results conflict (+$3.02M vs -$0.277M) and there’s a tax shield misstatement (“Tax shields 30% each year” with a 25% tax rate), undermining accuracy. Thus, the treatment is competent but not consistently correct, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student computed and applied IRR, correctly linking IRR vs. WACC to NPV sign, showing conceptual understanding. However, conflicting IRR outputs (13.25% vs 8.13%) and inconsistent NPV signs without reconciliation indicate gaps in accuracy and thoroughness. Under moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and discussed both simple and discounted payback, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, results are inconsistent (5.28 vs 7.11 years; discounted payback 8.21 years vs infinite) with minimal methodological explanation, limiting accuracy and depth. Thus, the criterion is only partially met.",

      "reasoning": "The student follows the DRIVER structure and communicates specific assumptions, model components, and results, showing correct conceptual understanding and some sensitivity analysis. However, inconsistencies in reported outputs (multiple conflicting NPV/IRR statements) and limited reconciliation of tool-generated results reduce thoroughness, so the work meets a solid but not fully comprehensive standard."
