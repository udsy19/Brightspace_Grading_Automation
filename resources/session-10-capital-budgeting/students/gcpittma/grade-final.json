  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applied NPV by specifying cash flow components, discounting at WACC, and reporting a base-case NPV with sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a strong conceptual grasp. The inclusion of initial investment, working capital timing, and terminal value shows comprehensive coverage, and the Discover-Implement-Reflect stages substantiate correct calculation and interpretation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule in base and adverse scenarios, explicitly accepting when NPV is positive and rejecting when negative. They link NPV to the hurdle rate and value creation, and use sensitivity analysis to reinforce the rule, demonstrating a solid, applied understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined the model, stated the sensitivity scenarios, claimed to have run the calculations, and reported concrete results (including a -$3M NPV under -20% revenue). Those represent clear, personal execution of sensitivity analysis and explicit validation of its impact on the decision, meeting the strict DRIVER/Technical Implementation requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies IRR conceptually (compare IRR to WACC, sensitivity direction), but does not explain that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show how it was computed. The IRR value is also ambiguously stated (“12.8.4%”), indicating accuracy/gaps. Thus, understanding is present but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies that both simple and discounted payback occur within the 10-year life, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not determine or report the actual payback time or provide supporting detail, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial is appropriate under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a profitability index (1.22) consistent with the stated NPV and initial outlay, indicating basic understanding and correct computation. However, they do not explain the PI concept (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show how it was derived, providing limited depth.
