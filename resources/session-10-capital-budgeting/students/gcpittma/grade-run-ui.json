  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student meets the criterion by providing a base-case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC shifts) and by identifying decision breakpoints — explicitly showing a -20% revenue scenario flips NPV negative and noting the WACC>IRR rejection rule. Treatment is specific and linked to decision implications, satisfying the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the calculations, presents specific results (NPV, IRR, sensitivity outcome), and ties those results to stated assumptions (revenue, WACC) with correct directional logic. This constitutes a thorough, conceptually clear confirmation of valid execution and validation under the MODERATE standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the project, hurdle rate, and objective at the start and then defines detailed parameters before reporting calculations and moving to the cash-flow representation. This satisfies the requirement that Define/Discover was completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs, nor quantify these across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices. It also fails to connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content focuses on a Starbucks project’s operating/depreciation tax shield and WACC, which is unrelated to the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it cover asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The DRIVER stages provided only project evaluation and sensitivity analysis, leaving this criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It focuses on project NPV/IRR and sensitivity to revenue/WACC only. Despite clear DRIVER stages, the required leverage analysis is missing, so this criterion fails.",
