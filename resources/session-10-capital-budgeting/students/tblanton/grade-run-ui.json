  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC +2%), identified revenue as the critical driver, and explicitly reported a scenario that flips the decision (accept → reject). The work used REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT/VALIDATE stages to generate and check results against thresholds, satisfying the criterion at the required depth for this moderate evaluation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described running the code and installing dependencies, presented model assumptions and logic, and verbally validated outputs by comparing IRR/NPV to the hurdle and running stress scenarios. This demonstrates a thorough, coherent confirmation of valid code execution and result validation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated what the displayed outputs showed (NPV, IRR, payback, PI) and referenced units and time frames, plus explained multiple scenarios from stress testing. While stakeholder impacts weren’t explicitly broken out, the thorough description of results and scenario-driven capital allocation trade-offs meets the criterion under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs, no evaluation of buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, and no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Despite demonstrating project DCF work (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT), it does not address the specified capital structure trade-off criterion at all, resulting in a fail.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of who gains/loses under different financing or payout policies. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, despite solid DCF implementation, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project cash flows (NPV/IRR) and sensitivity to revenue/WACC but does not discuss financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility. It also omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics (interest coverage, DSCR) or any debt vs. equity scenarios. Given the absence of required leverage analysis, this criterion fails.",
