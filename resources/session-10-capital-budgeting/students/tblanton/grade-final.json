  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly articulated the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applied it across base and sensitivity scenarios, explicitly accepting when positive and rejecting when negative. Multiple applications and decision references demonstrate a solid, practical grasp suitable for a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined unlevered FCF as NOPAT plus depreciation minus changes in working capital minus capex and applied it across a 10-year model, including WC deployment/recovery and capex timing. The Implement stage shows comprehensive application (year-by-year FCF with terminal value and tax), satisfying a thorough, accurate treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and explicitly addressed both terminal value and working capital recovery, including tax treatment of salvage when book value is zero, and stated these are incorporated in the year-10 cash flow. This demonstrates accurate conceptual understanding and applied implementation, sufficient for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of NPV within a DCF framework and applies it via a cash-flow model including year-0 outlay, terminal value, and working capital recovery. However, inconsistent NPV figures and repeated “MPV” typos, with no reconciliation, reduce thoroughness. Given moderate strictness, this is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and applies it by computing and comparing IRR to the hurdle rate. However, the treatment is basic and includes inconsistent reported IRR values (12.84% vs. 16.14%) without explanation, and lacks a detailed discussion of the computation. This demonstrates understanding but not the thoroughness needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and attempted to compute the simple payback using cumulative cash flow and reported a result. However, the treatment lacks depth (no cumulative cash flow shown, no calculation steps or discussion of discounted vs. simple payback) and includes inconsistent results (“year 6” vs. “roughly 5 years”).

        "\"Okay, so this is session 10. Um, our objective was to determine the financial viability of a new 10-year flagship roaster requiring $12 million initial outlay and its hurdle rate is 8.5%.\"",
        "\"NPV is the sum of all discounted cash flows and this must be greater than zero to accept and the IRR is the discount rate that sets MPV to zero. So it must be greater than 8.5 to accept.\"",
        "\"So my final decision is to accept it. Um some financial justification. The project clears the 8.5% hurdle rate with a substantial buffer... the sensitivity analysis reveals that volume/revenue is the critical risk factor. So my recommendation is to proceed with the investment but structure the marketing budget to be heavier in year one and two to ensure we do not fall into the negative 20% revenue scenario.\""

      "driver_alignment": "- DISCOVER: clearly stated objective, project scope, and numerical inputs (investment, horizon, hurdle rate).\n- IMPLEMENT: described model construction and metrics calculation (cashflow model, NPV/IRR/payback).\n- REFLECT: provided interpretation, sensitivity analysis, risk assessment, and a concrete recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, detailed explanation of objectives, inputs, modeling approach, decision rules, results, and mitigation actions—covering discovery, implementation, and reflection. This thorough, well-structured communication meets the PASS standard."
