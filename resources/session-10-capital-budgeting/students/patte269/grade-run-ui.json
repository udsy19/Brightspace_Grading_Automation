  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC range), reported metric impacts, and identified that a 20% revenue decline flips NPV negative (changing the accept/reject outcome). This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually clear sensitivity analysis meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states executing the code (calling the function across scenarios and using printouts) and describes having verified key outputs (depreciation, taxes, terminal value, working capital). They also interpret results consistent with the stated assumptions (e.g., base NPV positive, –20% revenue yields negative NPV), meeting the threshold for a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what the charts/tables show, citing specific values, units (millions, percentages), timelines (Year 0–10), and scenarios (revenue –20%, WACC 6.5/8.5/10.5). They interpret the visual outputs to highlight capital allocation trade-offs (revenue sensitivity vs discount-rate risk), satisfying the criterion at a thorough level under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks’ project evaluation and mentions tax shields only within operating cash flow/WACC context, not capital structure choices. It does not quantify tax advantages or expected distress/optionality costs for alternatives, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: There is no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses under different choices. The submission also lacks explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, despite solid valuation work, the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze financial leverage or DFL, nor how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk. It omits coverage metrics (e.g., interest coverage/DSCR) and any discussion of debt levels being reduced or maintained. Therefore, it fails this criterion despite solid project-level WACC analysis.",
