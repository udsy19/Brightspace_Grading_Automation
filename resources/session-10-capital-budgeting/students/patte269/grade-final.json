  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly demonstrates NPV by explicitly discounting yearly cash flows at WACC, incorporating the initial outlay and terminal adjustments. They report base-case NPV and conduct sensitivity analysis, showing strong conceptual and applied mastery within the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and applies the NPV decision rule, demonstrates it across base and downside scenarios, and ties the recommendation to NPV’s sign. Multiple applications and sensitivity analysis show thorough, accurate understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR programmatically and reported it across scenarios, comparing it appropriately to WACC. Using Newton’s method indicates solving for the rate that zeros NPV, and multiple applications (base case and downside) show strong, accurate understanding. This meets a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of benefits over initial investment and applies it with a base-case value (1.22) and interpretation. However, treatment is brief with no deeper breakdown or multiple applications across scenarios, so it shows correct but basic understanding rather than thorough coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly models OCF and incorporates capex at Year 0 and working-capital recovery at the end, indicating a sound conceptual grasp of FCF components. However, they do not explicitly articulate FCF as OCF less capex and changes in working capital across periods or provide detailed numeric demonstration, limiting depth. Under a moderate standard, this supports a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements key incremental cash flows (initial capex, changes in working capital, OCF with tax shield, after-tax salvage), showing solid conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth on excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, cannibalization, opportunity costs), so the coverage is sound but not thorough enough for a PASS.",
