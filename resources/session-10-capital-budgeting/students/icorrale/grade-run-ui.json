  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case and multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%) with numeric NPVs/IRRs and interpreted the results, explicitly noting that a 20% revenue drop flips NPV negative (accept → reject). They demonstrated REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE stages and highlighted the key breakpoint (revenue decline causing project to become unprofitable), meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reported executing the model in Collab and gave specific numeric outputs, then described iterative debugging and re‑checking, demonstrating validation. Their verbal interpretation (positive NPV, IRR > WACC) aligns with the stated results, meeting the criterion for confirming valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the problem, stakeholder (Starbucks roastery), and objectives up front and documents detailed project parameters in the Discover stage, then proceeds to model those inputs. This clear, sequential DISCOVER → REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT flow meets the requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure trade-offs, tax shields, financial distress/flexibility costs, or compare buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor does it reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. It focuses solely on a Starbucks project valuation (NPV/IRR/sensitivity), so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never identifies who gains or loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The DRIVER loop was applied to valuation metrics and sensitivity only, not to agency considerations. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project cash flows, NPV/IRR, and sensitivity to revenue and WACC, but does not analyze how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, nor does it present DFL math or coverage/bankruptcy considerations. Given the absence of leverage analysis or stakeholder risk implications, it does not meet the criterion.",
