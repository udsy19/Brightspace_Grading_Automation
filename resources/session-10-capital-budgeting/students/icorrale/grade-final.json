  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by building a comprehensive DCF with revenues, costs, taxes, depreciation, working capital timing, and terminal value, then discounting at the 8.5% WACC to obtain NPV. They correctly interpret NPV and extend analysis with sensitivity scenarios showing how NPV changes with revenue and WACC, indicating depth beyond basics. This meets the thoroughness expected for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV is positive and recognize unprofitability when NPV turns negative, with explicit values and interpretation. They extend this with sensitivity cases (revenue and WACC) and a recommendation, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly built and described the cash-flow components and formulas, ran the calculations to produce numeric NPVs/IRR/paybacks, and demonstrated verification and debugging. These actions show personal execution, block-level understanding of key inputs (depreciation, COGS, WC, terminal value), and ownership of errors, meeting the strict technical-implementation standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (13.25%) and used it across scenarios, appropriately comparing it to WACC and recognizing that changing WACC does not change IRR. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation process, making the treatment accurate but basic. Thus, under moderate strictness, this supports a PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports both simple (5.28 years) and discounted (8.21 years) payback and provides a brief, accurate interpretation of each. However, they do not show the cumulative cash flow path, the fraction-year derivation, or sensitivity impacts on payback, resulting in a basic rather than thorough treatment. Hence, correct but not comprehensive → PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a PI of 1.24 and provides the right interpretation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not demonstrate the calculation as present value of benefits divided by initial investment or provide supporting detail, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, this meets a partial level under the moderate standard.",
