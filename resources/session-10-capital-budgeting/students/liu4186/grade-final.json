  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly defined NPV, constructed appropriate cash flows including initial outlay and adjustments, discounted them at WACC, and reported a specific NPV with sensitivity tests. Implementation and Validation stages explicitly confirm correct calculation and methodology, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly defines the NPV decision rule, applies it to a computed base-case NPV to support acceptance, and tests the rule under adverse scenarios to show rejection when NPV turns negative. This demonstrates a strong, applied understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains FCF as operating cash flow minus capex and changes in working capital, details OCF construction (including depreciation add-back), and correctly applies timing for initial outflow and end-of-life recovery. Concrete numbers (year 0 -12.5m FCF; year 10 WC recovery) and stage-based application meet the moderate standard for depth and completeness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses IRR as a decision criterion and reports a specific IRR result, showing basic understanding and application. However, they skip the computation details and do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor provide depth or examples beyond the single outcome. This is correct but not thorough, meriting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and distinguishes payback and discounted payback, providing approximate timeframes, which shows conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief with no detailed calculation, breakdown, or interpretation beyond the high-level result. Under moderate standards, this is accurate but not thorough, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss or calculate the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). Across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, the student focuses on NPV, IRR, and payback without introducing PI, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
