  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC changes) with numeric results and explicitly identifies a breakpoint (20% revenue decline turning NPV negative) and near‑boundary behavior. The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) are applied and support a thorough, well‑explained sensitivity analysis, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly describes the contents of a cash flow table and a sensitivity chart, including units (dollars, percentages, years) and multiple scenarios, and ties them to accept/reject decisions. This clearly communicates capital allocation trade-offs and decision boundary implications, satisfying the criterion at a comprehensive level within the DRIVER Implementation stage.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student runs explicit sensitivity tests on key drivers (revenue and WACC), provides quantified outcomes, and clearly explains how these shifts move the project from accept to reject, altering the risk profile. This is a thorough, well-integrated treatment consistent with moderate strictness expectations.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs among buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor quantify tax advantages versus expected distress/flexibility costs, and it does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Mention of a depreciation tax shield is unrelated to the required capital structure tax shield analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of stakeholder agency conflicts is present, nor any explanation of who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. The submission does not address asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics, especially those related to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, despite solid NPV/IRR analysis, the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or compute DFL; it remains at an unlevered project analysis using NPV/IRR. It also omits discussion of bankruptcy risk and debt coverage metrics under different leverage choices. Given the absence of leverage math and capital structure implications, this criterion is not demonstrated.",
