  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case and ran multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), discussed their implications, and identified that a 20% revenue drop flips NPV negative—i.e., a stakeholder decision breakpoint. The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) are evident and the analysis is thorough enough to meet the moderate standard for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code (implemented function, printed summary, \"ran two sensitivity tests\") and reports specific outputs (NPV = 3.023M, IRR, scenario NPV changes) tied back to documented assumptions (assumptions table, terminal value causing year-10 spike). This shows thorough verbal confirmation of execution and that the logic/assumptions align with the stated results, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrated what the tables and charts show, citing specific values, years, and drivers (working capital recovery, terminal value) and explaining scenarios (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%) with dollar magnitudes. Multiple visuals were described with sufficient depth to clarify capital allocation trade-offs, satisfying the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off criterion: no quantification of debt tax shield benefits versus expected distress/optionality costs across payout alternatives, and no linkage to Apple’s current balance sheet/risk. Content is limited to Starbucks project-level capital budgeting and depreciation tax shields, not capital structure decisions.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor who gains/loses under different choices. It also lacks any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Even with moderate standards, the criterion is missing, so the student fails this component.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, shows no DFL math, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics. While the DRIVER stages are present, they center on NPV/IRR and revenue/WACC sensitivities, not leverage dynamics required by this criterion.",
