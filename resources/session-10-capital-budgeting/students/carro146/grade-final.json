  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructed and explained the full discounted cash flow framework, correctly incorporating initial outflows, working capital, depreciation/tax effects, and terminal value, then computed NPV at the stated hurdle rate. They reinforced understanding via sensitivity to discount rate and revenues, aligning with the decision rule, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery of NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV accept/reject rule, identifies NPV as the primary metric, and applies it to a base-case acceptance and a sensitivity case that turns NPV negative. The discussion is specific, linked to the modeled results, and demonstrates clear conceptual understanding across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR and applied it across scenarios (base 13.3%, revenue down 3.2%), and correctly noted IRR’s dependence on cash flows rather than the discount rate. Coupled with implementation detail and sensitivity validation, this demonstrates a thorough, accurate grasp consistent with a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly determined and reported both simple and discounted payback periods and tied them to the project’s timeline, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not show the cumulative cash-flow crossover details, discuss methodology, or explore payback sensitivity/implications, so coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted the profitability index (1.242) and showed awareness of the initial outlay components, implying proper PI calculation. However, they did not detail the PV-of-benefits calculation or explicitly connect PI to PV/initial outlay beyond the brief statement, making the treatment correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly includes major incremental cash flows (initial capex, WC investment and recovery, depreciation tax shield, operating cash flows, terminal value) and builds a full FCF schedule. However, they don’t explicitly address excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, financing costs/interest, cannibalization or opportunity costs).
