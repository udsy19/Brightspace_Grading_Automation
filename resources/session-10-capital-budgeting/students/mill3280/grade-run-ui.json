  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ↑), quantifies their effects on NPV and IRR, and explicitly notes the breakpoint where IRR falls below WACC (accept → reject). The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Evolve, Validate) support a thorough, interpretable sensitivity analysis, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the code end-to-end and installing libraries, explains the core assumptions and cash-flow logic used in the script, and cites concrete numeric outputs (NPV, IRR) and sensitivity checks that align with those assumptions. This demonstrates a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and validation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents Define & Discover before modeling—stating the decision question, hurdle rate, initial investment, working capital, depreciation, and terminal value—and notes these inputs were parameterized prior to implementation. Because the D-stage is clearly presented up front and then used in Represent/Implement, the criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure choices, debt tax shields, financial distress or flexibility costs, nor quantify these across alternatives. It focuses on project-level depreciation tax shields and Starbucks’ WACC, and provides no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts among stakeholders, no identification of who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices, and no discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. All DRIVER stages centered on NPV/IRR sensitivity and operations/marketing risks, leaving this criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, provides no DFL math, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. While WACC and sensitivity analyses are shown (DISCOVER/EVOLVE), they do not substitute for leverage analysis; hence the criterion is missing.",
