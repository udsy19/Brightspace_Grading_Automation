  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong NPV grasp by defining discount rate and all key cash flow elements, constructing after-tax FCFs, and reporting/using NPV for the accept/reject decision. Sensitivity to revenue and WACC further evidences comprehensive application. Despite minor inconsistencies, the treatment is thorough and aligns across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule and applies it to a positive-NPV base case, then tests a scenario where NPV turns negative and interprets it as value destruction. Use of Validate, Evolve, and Reflect stages demonstrates thorough, accurate understanding of when to accept or reject based on NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp of FCF by outlining OCF via NOPAT plus depreciation, incorporating CapEx timing, and explicitly handling working capital changes and after-tax terminal value. They connect these elements within a runable model, indicating comprehensive application rather than surface mention. This satisfies a thorough, moderate-standard treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly computed and applied IRR, comparing it to WACC and exploring sensitivity, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation/logic behind it, so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a discounted payback period and provided a brief interpretation, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, coverage is basic: no calculation detail, cash flow buildup, or sensitivity/nuance about simple vs. discounted payback. Under the moderate standard, this supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly interprets PI and provides a value, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain the calculation (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or detail components included in numerator/denominator, resulting in basic coverage rather than thorough treatment. Hence, PARTIAL under the moderate standard.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented specific cost assumptions and incorporated them into a disciplined DRIVER workflow (Discover/Represent/Implement/Validate/Evolve). However, they did not justify or externally validate the real estate/construction cost figures (no breakdown, market comps, vendor estimates, or rationale for the $12M capex), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
