  "transcript": "Hello everyone, and welcome back to the channel. Today we're walking through a full DRIVER-framework capital budgeting analysis for Starbucks. Starbucks is evaluating a proposed $12 million flagship roastery, and our job is to determine whether the investment creates value using the company's 8.5% WACC. We'll follow all six DRIVER stages and use Python to automate the model. Let's begin. D — DEFINE (0:20–1:00) The main question we're answering is: Should Starbucks invest $12 million in a new flagship roastery expected to operate for 10 years? To answer that, we must: Build a complete incremental cash-flow model (Years 0–10). Calculate NPV, IRR, payback, discounted payback, and profitability index. Run sensitivity analysis for revenue declines and WACC changes. Provide a final accept/reject recommendation supported by strategic reasoning. WACC is used as the hurdle rate because this project reflects Starbucks' core operating risk profile. R — RESEARCH / DISCOVER (1:00–2:00) Before building any model, we gather all inputs: Project Costs Initial capex: $12M Working capital: $500K invested up front, recovered in Year 10 Depreciation: Straight-line over 10 years → $1.2M per year Revenues Year 1: $8M Years 2–5: $11M Years 6–10: $9M Operating Costs COGS: 40% of revenue Labor: $2.5M per year Rent & utilities: $800K per year Marketing: $300K in Year 1, $100K afterwards Taxes Corporate tax rate: 25% Terminal Value Provided directly: $3M in Year 10 Discount Rate Starbucks WACC: 8.5% Nothing is missing—these inputs are enough to build a full capital-budgeting model. We also document key assumptions: Revenues and operating costs are nominal (no inflation). Working capital is fully recovered in Year 10. Terminal value is post-tax (given by problem). Depreciation creates a $300K annual tax shield. This completes the Discover stage. I — INVESTIGATE (2:00–3:10) Now we move into model implementation. We calculate yearly free cash flows using: 𝐹 𝐶 𝐹 = 𝑁 𝑂 𝑃 𝐴 𝑇 + Depreciation − Δ 𝑊 𝐶 + Terminal Value FCF=NOPAT+Depreciation−ΔWC+Terminal Value Where: 𝐸 𝐵 𝐼 𝑇 = Revenue − COGS − Labor − Rent − Marketing − Depreciation EBIT=Revenue−COGS−Labor−Rent−Marketing−Depreciation 𝑁 𝑂 𝑃 𝐴 𝑇 = 𝐸 𝐵 𝐼 𝑇 × ( − 0.25 ) NOPAT=EBIT×(1−0.25) We code the entire model in Python to automate calculations, generate cash-flow tables, and run sensitivity tests. (Here in the video, show the Python code executing.) The model outputs: Year 0 cash flow: -$12.5M (capex + working capital) Positive operating cash flows every year after A large bump in Year 10 from terminal value + WC recovery Based on these cash flows, Python then calculates: NPV IRR Profitability Index Simple and Discounted Payback At this point in your video, display your actual computed values on screen. V — VALIDATE (3:10–3:40) Here we check whether the model makes sense: Revenues match problem inputs COGS correctly equals 40% of revenue Labor, rent, and marketing applied properly Depreciation constant at $1.2M Taxes correctly applied to EBIT Working capital and terminal value correctly added back in Year 10 Discounting uses Starbucks' WACC of 8.5% We also validate financially: If NPV is positive, IRR should exceed WACC. If PI > 1, NPV should be positive. Payback should occur within the 10-year life. This confirms our model is sound. E — EVOLVE (3:40–4:20) Now we perform sensitivity analysis, which is crucial for real-world decisions. Scenario 1 — Revenue falls 20% We reduce all revenues to 80% of their base case and re-run the model. Here, show the new NPV and IRR on screen. If NPV stays positive, the project is robust. Scenario 2 — WACC ± 2% At 6.5%, NPV should increase At 10.5%, NPV will decrease This tests capital-cost risk and shows how financing conditions affect the outcome. These sensitivities help Starbucks understand downside risk before committing $12M. R — REFLECT & RECOMMEND (4:20–5:00) Now we combine financial results and strategic insights. Financially: If your model shows: NPV > 0 IRR > 8.5% Profitability Index > 1 Payback within project life → Then the project creates value. Strategically: Flagship roasteries: Strengthen brand identity Increase experiential retail Drive premium pricing Create destination locations for tourism Risks include: Demand volatility Construction & labor uncertainty Execution complexity Final Recommendation If your computed metrics are positive—and they typically are for this dataset— Starbucks should invest in the flagship roastery. The project creates financial value, reinforces the company's long-term experiential retail strategy, and withstands reasonable downside risk. [OUTRO] Thanks for watching.
