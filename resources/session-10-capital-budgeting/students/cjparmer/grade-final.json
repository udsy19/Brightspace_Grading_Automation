  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and explicitly uses the NPV decision rule—accept if NPV > 0 at the WACC—and ties it to related metrics and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. Multiple DRIVER stages apply the rule (Validate, Reflect, Evolve), showing comprehensive, decision-oriented use of NPV rather than a superficial mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models only project-caused cash flows: initial capex and WC, operating revenues/costs, tax via NOPAT, depreciation add-back, ΔWC, and terminal value, with correct timing. They avoid financing flows and verify WC and terminal treatment, demonstrating a thorough, accurate incremental cash-flow approach.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and clearly applies OCF as EBIT×(1−T)+Depreciation by defining EBIT, computing NOPAT as EBIT×(1−T), and adding back depreciation, while also quantifying the depreciation tax shield. Evidence spans Discover, Implement, and Validate stages, demonstrating solid conceptual accuracy sufficient for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly sets up FCFs, includes the initial investment, applies WACC for discounting, and states that NPV is computed, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not present the NPV formula explicitly or the actual NPV value, and the depth of the NPV calculation is not demonstrated beyond assertions and checks. This is correct but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes IRR in the modeling and demonstrates a sound conceptual check (IRR > WACC when NPV > 0). However, they do not define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero nor show the computed IRR value or method details. This indicates correct but basic treatment, meriting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both simple and discounted payback and indicates the model computes them, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not present the actual payback period, cumulative cash flow logic, or any detailed explanation, so depth is lacking. This meets a basic standard but falls short of the thorough treatment required for a PASS.",
