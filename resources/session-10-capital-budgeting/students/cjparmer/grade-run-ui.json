  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the Python code and displaying computed outputs, documents key assumptions that feed the model, and articulates concrete validation checks tying results to expectations. These elements demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and logical consistency, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the project question and upfront objectives in the DEFINE segment and enumerates all model inputs and assumptions in the DISCOVER segment, even noting \"This completes the Discover stage.\" The follow-on line \"Now we move into model implementation\" confirms modeling started after D and R, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission clearly specifies the models, scenarios, metrics, and data needs before coding (Define/Discover) and then demonstrates direct implementation of that plan via Python-generated cash flows, computed NPV/IRR/PI, and sensitivity tests (Investigate/Implement). This alignment and execution satisfy the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, tax shield of debt, financial distress/flexibility costs, or choices among buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, and it never references Apple. The only “tax shield” mentioned is from depreciation, not capital structure. Across the DRIVER stages, the work remains a Starbucks project-level NPV analysis, leaving this criterion unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify stakeholder winners/losers or why incentives diverge, and it does not discuss asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. All DRIVER stages focus on project valuation metrics, leaving the agency-conflict criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice impacts ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. There is no discussion of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics; only WACC sensitivity is mentioned, which is insufficient for this criterion.",
