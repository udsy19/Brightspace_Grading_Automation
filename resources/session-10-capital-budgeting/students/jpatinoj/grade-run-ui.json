  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented base case plus two explicit sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%) and identified the critical breakpoint where NPV turns negative at -20% revenue, linking this to the investment recommendation. Represent, Implement, and Validate stages provide clear evidence of both execution and interpretation, meeting the criterion's requirements.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built and ran sensitivities on key drivers (revenue/FCF variability and discount rate) and explicitly explained how results impact risk and the recommendation (accept only with strong demand evidence). This goes beyond a mention by validating behavior and interpreting negative NPV under a revenue shock, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for this moderate criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the decision problem and that inputs were collected \"before doing any modeling,\" satisfying the requirement that Define & Discover precede modeling. Subsequent quotes document modeling in Python, confirming the D-stage was not post-hoc.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR model and sensitivity, not on capital structure choices (buyback/dividend/debt reduction). It lacks any quantification of tax shield benefits, expected distress or flexibility/optionality costs, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and does not identify winners/losers under different choices. It also omits asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite solid DRIVER execution on NPV/IRR, the criterion is missing, so this is a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not present DFL or leverage math, and omits coverage metrics or bankruptcy risk. It focuses on project cash flows and demand sensitivity, which is operational risk, not financial leverage. Under moderate strictness, conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided.",
