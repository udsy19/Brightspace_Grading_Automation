  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, accurate NPV treatment: defining discount rate and horizon, constructing comprehensive cash flows, computing NPV via a model, and interpreting results with sensitivity. Validation and reflection show understanding of how NPV responds to assumptions, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by linking a positive NPV at the firm’s WACC to acceptance and noting rejection risk when NPV turns negative under downside scenarios. Validation of NPV behavior across discount rates and sensitivity analysis demonstrates depth beyond a basic mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented and ran sensitivity tests on two key assumptions (revenue and WACC), validated that outputs behaved as expected, and reported concrete results (MPV negative at -20% revenue). These statements show personal execution, parameterization, and validation consistent with the DRIVER stages, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and used IRR, discussed NPV behavior across discount rates, and verified a key IRR property, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly articulate IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show the zero-NPV crossover, and provided limited depth on calculation methodology. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented and referenced both simple and discounted payback, showing conceptual understanding and capability to determine recovery time. However, they did not present the actual payback periods or analyze them, focusing reflection on NPV/IRR instead. This constitutes correct but basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and computed the profitability index within a parameterized model and set up the necessary cash flows, showing basic understanding. However, they did not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment, provide the PI value, or discuss its interpretation or implications. Thus, coverage is correct but not thorough, warranting PARTIAL.",
