  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies NPV by discounting yearly free cash flows at the stated WACC, incorporating initial outflows (including working capital), recovery of working capital, and after-tax terminal value, then subtracting outflows from PV inflows to arrive at NPV. They provide concrete figures and discuss sensitivity, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding despite minor phrasing issues elsewhere.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0), ties positive NPV to shareholder value, and explicitly notes rejection if NPV turns negative. They support this with an implemented model and reflection via sensitivity on terminal value, showing thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly modeled cash flows across multiple phases (Year 1, Years 2–5, Years 6–10) and quantified resulting OCF levels for each phase. They implemented this logic programmatically with year-based conditions, demonstrating a strong, applied grasp. The treatment is detailed and comprehensive enough for a PASS under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and cited an IRR (12.3%) and applied it by comparing to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate how IRR relates to the NPV function beyond invoking Excel’s IRR, and their NPV explanation is oversimplified. Thus, evidence supports correct but not thorough treatment, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never calculates or discusses the time required to recover the initial investment (simple or discounted payback). Despite constructing cash flows and analyzing NPV/IRR, there is no cumulative cash flow timeline or statement of the year when payback occurs. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student did not calculate or explain the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or interpret its threshold. While they produced PVs of inflows and identified the initial outlay, they only applied NPV and IRR, leaving the PI concept unaddressed; under moderate standards, this omission results in a fail for this criterion.",
