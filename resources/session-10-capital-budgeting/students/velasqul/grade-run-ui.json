  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly references running a Python cash-flow model, describes the implementation logic, and reports validated outputs (NPV/IRR) that match the provided assumptions, demonstrating a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly defines the problem and objectives up front and states \"we're going to discover...\" before building the cash flow model, meeting the requirement that Define & Discover occur prior to modeling. No evidence indicates the Discover stage was missing or performed only post-hoc.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described the modeling plan (models, metrics, and sensitivity scenarios) and the required data inputs before implementation, then implemented those plans in Python and produced NPV/IRR and sensitivity analyses. This clear mapping from representation to implemented artifacts satisfies the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project NPV/IRR for a Starbucks roastery and never addresses the capital structure trade-off between tax shields and financial distress/flexibility across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices. There is no quantification of tax benefits or expected distress/optionality costs, nor any linkage to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Thus, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Aside from a brief mention of shareholder value, there is no conceptual treatment of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage; it stays at capital budgeting cash flows/NPV. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided beyond naming WACC, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
