  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by computing NPV, noting it is positive, and concluding the project should be accepted. They reinforce understanding through sensitivity checks showing NPV remains positive under stress, demonstrating depth appropriate for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted both simple and discounted payback periods and corroborated them with a cumulative cash flow visualization. The implementation detail, graphical representation, and reflection on the timing of break-even demonstrate a thorough and accurate treatment suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly assembled free cash flow by computing operating cash flows and adjusting for capital expenditures and working capital timing, and demonstrated this in a detailed schedule and timeline. Implementation details and explicit mention of WC investment/recovery and initial CapEx show thorough, accurate treatment aligned with the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed NPV with an appropriate discount rate, included key cash flow components (initial investment, working capital recovery, terminal value), and provided a specific NPV result with interpretation and sensitivity—demonstrating applied understanding. However, the stated explanation that NPV “subtracts depreciation” reflects a conceptual error in cash flow treatment, preventing a thorough, fully accurate treatment required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR (12.84%), compares it to WACC, and discusses sensitivity, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero nor demonstrate that NPV equals zero at the computed IRR, leaving the treatment incomplete for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: They computed and discussed a profitability index and correctly noted the ratio interpretation ($1.32 per $1). However, they mislabeled PI with “years” and did not articulate that PI equals the present value of benefits divided by the initial investment. This shows basic but incomplete and partially confused understanding, warranting PARTIAL under a moderate standard.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents major assumptions (rates, capex, WC, revenues) and validates them via code and sensitivity analysis, showing understanding (Discover/Implement/Reflect). However, they provide limited justification for specific choices (e.g., revenue trajectory, terminal value, exact capex) beyond brief checks, so treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a full pass."
