  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports implementing and running Python code, resolving errors, and printing/graphing results, and they state they checked key assumptions (e.g., tax rate) and verified outputs matched expectations (including sensitivity testing). These behaviors satisfy the criterion for verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what the visuals show (bars for cash flows, a blue cumulative line, when it turns positive) and explains table contents by component and perspective, linking to stakeholder impacts and capital allocation (initial outlay vs annual gains). They also state units and scenarios (dollars, years, base case, terminal value), satisfying the criterion with depth across Represent and Implement stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents Define/Discover work (problem, stakeholders/objectives, input components) before moving to Represent and then Implement (timeline and Python code). This clear, sequential demonstration meets the criterion that D-stage was completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires quantifying tax shield advantages versus distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices and linking the trade-off to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The submission analyzes a Starbucks capital budgeting project and mentions a corporate tax rate only for operating cash flows, with no treatment of leverage, payouts, or Apple. Even under a moderate standard, the required concept is missing; hence, FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR/payback and project risk but does not identify stakeholders who gain/lose or explain divergent incentives. It also omits any discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. Given the absence of these required concepts despite a solid DRIVER process, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: There is no discussion or calculation of leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE impacts, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. The analysis focuses solely on project cash flows and sensitivity to revenue and WACC, not capital structure or downside risk from debt. Given the complete omission of the criterion’s required content, this scores as FAIL.",
