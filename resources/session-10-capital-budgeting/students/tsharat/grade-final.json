  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV by constructing FCFs, accounting for the initial outlay and terminal flows, discounting at the stated WACC, and reporting a concrete NPV figure. They extended this with multiple applications via scenario and sensitivity analyses (WACC, revenue, heatmap), demonstrating strong conceptual and practical grasp across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule and applies it in baseline and multiple sensitivity scenarios, showing accept when NPV > 0 and reject when NPV < 0. The heatmap further demonstrates understanding of thresholds where the rule flips, providing thorough, applied treatment across DRIVER stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student shows a parameterized model that computes multiple capital budgeting metrics and supports advanced, automated sensitivity outputs (heatmap, tornado). While code isn’t shown, the discussion evidences automation across DRIVER stages and thorough application, satisfying the moderate standard for depth.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, provided specific values, and used it alongside NPV in baseline and sensitivity scenarios, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately determined and interpreted the discounted payback period with a specific value and supporting visualization, showing conceptual understanding of recovery timing. However, they did not compute or discuss the simple payback period or provide deeper analysis/sensitivity on payback, so coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires calculating the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While PI is listed among metrics in the Represent stage, the submission provides neither its formula nor a computed value in the Implement or Validate stages. Given the absence of any PI calculation or discussion beyond naming it, this does not meet the criterion.",

      "reasoning": "The submission computed firm-level metrics (WACC, IRR, NPV) and discussed sensitivity, but contains no discussion or citation of industry benchmark returns for retail locations or comparable store-level ROI standards. Therefore it fails this criterion—correct technical analysis is present but the required industry benchmark comparison is missing."

      "reasoning": "The submission clearly documents core real estate/construction assumptions and applies them in the model (D, R, I) and tests their impact (V), satisfying basic validation. However, it lacks justification for why specific values were chosen (e.g., rationale for 8.5% WACC, 40% COGS, $1.2M depreciation), so treatment is correct but incomplete."
