  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC change), ranks drivers via Tornado/heatmap, and explicitly identifies breakpoints (revenue -20% causing rejection and a 90% revenue threshold). This detailed, multi-method sensitivity treatment meets the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates multiple visuals (FCF schedule, Tornado, Heatmap, cumulative discounted FCF) with specific results, units ($, %, years), and scenarios (Rev -20%, WACC +2%), explaining implications for the accept/hold trade-off. This meets the moderate standard with thorough, multi-visual interpretation that supports capital allocation decisions.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built and discussed multiple sensitivity/stress tests (scenarios, tornado, heatmap) and quantified impacts on NPV and decision outcomes, showing how risk profile and recommendation change under adverse drivers. Although not all example drivers (e.g., tax rate) were tested, coverage of revenue, COGS, and WACC is thorough and tied to the strategic recommendation, satisfying a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires quantifying tax shield benefits versus distress/optionality costs across payout/debt choices and connecting conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. The submission focuses on Starbucks project NPV/IRR sensitivity, with no discussion or quantification of capital structure trade-offs and no Apple linkage. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under alternative financing or risk choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage/buybacks. All analysis centers on project cash flows and sensitivity to operating assumptions, leaving the criterion unaddressed despite solid DRIVER execution.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss degree of financial leverage, EPS/ROE volatility, or stakeholder implications, nor does it include bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. All analysis centers on operating cash flows and NPV/IRR sensitivity, not financing choice effects. Hence, it fails this criterion.",
