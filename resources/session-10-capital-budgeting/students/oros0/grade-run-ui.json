  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reported generating and running Python code and presented concrete outputs (cash flow table, NPV/IRR/payback, sensitivity results). They also verbally connected those outputs to key assumptions (timing of revenues, depreciation, WACC), demonstrating valid execution and interpretation consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented the project definition and assumptions (scope, investment, timeline, WACC, tax rate, terminal value, working capital) and stated they would \"start with the discover and design\" before building the model. Therefore the Define & Discover stage is present and completed prior to modeling, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated a clear plan of models, scenarios, and metrics (cash‑flow model, WACC hurdle, NPV/IRR, sensitivity cases) before coding and then executed that plan via Python, producing the cash‑flow schedule and sensitivity results. Evidence shows systematic linkage from the represent-stage plan to implemented artifacts and validation, meeting the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss, quantify, or compare tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs for alternative capital allocation choices, and makes no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. All provided work focuses on a Starbucks project cash-flow/WACC analysis, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The work focuses on cash-flow metrics and generic project risks, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, DFL, or downside risk, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Even under moderate standards, no conceptual leverage analysis is provided; the work centers on capital budgeting metrics only.",
