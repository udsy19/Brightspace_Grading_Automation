  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed the provided Python code (stated they ran the model), explained key functions that compute annual revenue and cash flows, and reported NPV/IRR-related outputs and sensitivity results. Though AI-generated code was used, the student demonstrated personal execution, block-level understanding, and validation of NPV outcomes, meeting the strict technical implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly constructed a year‑0 to year‑10 free cash flow model with line items (revenues, COGS, depreciation, taxes, working capital, terminal value), explained the code blocks that build those flows, and executed the Python model producing summarized outputs and sensitivity tests. These explicit REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE actions meet the strict requirement for personal execution, block‑level understanding, and verification.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined and executed sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), explained the relevant code function that applies the scaling factor, and reported numeric NPV impacts. Although they used ChatGPT to generate code, they demonstrated block-level understanding, ran the model, and interpreted results—meeting the strict requirement for personal execution and ownership.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV and applies it via a modeled cash flow with WACC, reporting base and sensitivity NPVs, which demonstrates calculation. However, presentation lacks depth and precision (unclear units, inconsistent interpretation versus positive NPV/PI), so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Although the student defines NPV and references using WACC as the hurdle, they conclude “reject” while also reporting a positive base-case NPV (~$3M) and PI > 1, contradicting the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0 at the hurdle rate). They do not clearly state or correctly apply the accept/reject rule, indicating a misunderstanding despite implementing a model and reflecting on results.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and references implementing an IRR calculation, then qualitatively uses IRR in the recommendation. However, they do not present the actual IRR value, show how it was computed, or compare it numerically to the hurdle rate, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",

        "\"For the project perimeters, the initial investment is going to be $12 million and that includes the building equipment and training and that's going to be depreciated straight line over the 10 years.\"",
        "\"I've actually plugged all this in the chat GPT and it got us a Python code.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — defined the project scope, assumptions, and objectives (initial investment, revenue schedule, depreciation, WACC).  \nImplement — described building and running the Python cash‑flow model and computations.  \nReflect — summarized results, sensitivity findings, strategic fit, risks, and gave a clear recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly communicated project assumptions, model design, and analytic approach (Discover/Implement) and presented quantitative results with a policy recommendation and sensitivity discussion (Reflect). Coverage is specific and substantive—providing assumptions, methods, outputs, risks, and next steps—meeting the threshold for a thorough, passing explanation."
