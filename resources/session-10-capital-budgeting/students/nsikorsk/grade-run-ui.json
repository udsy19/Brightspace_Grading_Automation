  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case and ran explicit sensitivities (revenue and WACC), including a numeric breakpoint (10% revenue decline → negative NPV) that indicates when stakeholder preference would shift. The analysis links the sensitivity results to recommendations, demonstrating thorough, competency-level treatment.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Define/Discover stage (objective, metrics, assumptions) before moving to Represent/modeling, satisfying the requirement that D be completed and recorded prior to modeling. No post-hoc or missing D-stage is indicated, so the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student specified a clear pre-implementation plan (models, sequence, metrics: NPV, IRR, payback) in Represent and then implemented those elements (depreciation, cash flows, terminal value) and validated results with sensitivity checks. This shows a systematic linkage from plan to implemented artifacts, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - No discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress costs, or flexibility/optionality across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction. No connection to Apple’s capital structure or risk profile. Evidence shows a project-level Starbucks cash flow analysis instead, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. It remains purely a project valuation and sensitivity exercise focused on shareholder NPV/IRR, leaving the criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses financing choice, degree of financial leverage (DFL), or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits any mention of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Given the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided, so this criterion fails.",
