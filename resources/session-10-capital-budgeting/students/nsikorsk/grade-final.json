  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV>0 at the hurdle rate and reject when NPV<0, supported by base-case acceptance and a sensitivity case turning negative. They also connect NPV>0 to IRR>WACC, demonstrating solid conceptual understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly specified straight-line depreciation ($1.2M/yr), described the tax and EBIT → net income logic, incorporated depreciation in the FCF formula, applied these in the model (producing NPV/IRR), and performed validation checks confirming period-by-period treatment. Minor wording typos do not obscure an explicit, correct implementation and validation of depreciation and taxes.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a systematic investment evaluation framework end-to-end: structured assumptions, modeled FCFs, applied NPV/IRR/payback, validated logic, and conducted sensitivity analyses leading to a decision. Despite minor notation slips, the treatment is detailed and comprehensive, meeting the standard for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student identifies the discount rate, builds a cash-flow model, and reports an NPV, demonstrating core understanding and application. However, explanations contain accuracy issues (e.g., incorrect tax/FCF formulation and variable confusion), and the NPV mechanics are not explained in depth. Thus, coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR and demonstrates the NPV–IRR relationship, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show the computation/method, and coverage lacks depth. Hence, correct but basic → PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and computed an approximate payback period and outlined the remainder/next-year-FCF approach. However, the treatment is brief, lacks cumulative cash flow support, and shows uncertainty about working capital’s role, falling short of a thorough explanation required for a PASS in this moderate category.",
