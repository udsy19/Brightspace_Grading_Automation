  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the problem statement, hurdle rate, and all key parameters before describing model inputs and the Python implementation, meeting the requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling. There is no indication the D-stage was done post-hoc.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documented inputs, OCF formulas, metrics (NPV, IRR, profitability index) and a sensitivity plan before coding and then explicitly described the Python implementation that produced the planned cash-flow outputs, showing clear linkage from plan to artifacts. This meets the moderate standard for a systematic plan-to-implementation representation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a clear, systematic execution: a planned iterative implementation, specific intermediate calculations (year-5 sample), and summarized cash-flow outputs tied to the NPV decision. These elements demonstrate traceable steps that align the Implement stage with the Represented plan and validation criteria, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project capital budgeting (Starbucks) and implementation steps, not on capital structure trade-offs among buybacks/dividends/debt reduction. It does not quantify debt tax shield benefits versus expected distress/optionality costs, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Evidence shows a narrow NPV/WACC and coding focus, with no stakeholder incentive analysis, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor any mention of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It focuses solely on project cash flows and NPV/IRR, which does not meet this criterion even under moderate standards allowing conceptual treatment.",
