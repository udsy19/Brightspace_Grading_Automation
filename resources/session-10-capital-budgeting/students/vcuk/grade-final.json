  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student describes a parameterized Python workflow that programmatically generates cash flows, applies terminal value/NWC recovery, and computes NPV/IRR/PI, plus sensitivity analysis—indicating genuine automation rather than manual calculation. The coverage spans setup, iterative computation, and metric outputs, meeting the moderate standard with thorough application despite minor numerical slips.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly modeled distinct cash flow phases (Year 1, Years 2–5, Years 6–10), included non-operating phases (initial outlay, WC deployment/recovery, terminal value), and implemented this in code over the full timeline. The discussion and example computations demonstrate a strong conceptual grasp of multi-phase cash flow modeling, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a comprehensive, structured capital budgeting framework: clear inputs, OCF/total CF construction with depreciation, NWC, and terminal value, discounting via WACC, multiple evaluation metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback), and sensitivity analysis, plus an implementation plan in Python. This demonstrates depth and systematic evaluation beyond surface-level discussion, satisfying the criterion despite minor wording/notation slips.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual setup for NPV (inputs, discount rate, cash flow components) and references the NPV formula, indicating understanding. However, they do not present the discounted present values, the computed NPV figure, or an accept/reject decision based on NPV. This constitutes correct but incomplete treatment, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0 using the 8.5% WACC) and indicates application via the NPV formula, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief, lacks a computed NPV or explicit accept/reject conclusion, and doesn’t explore nuances, so it falls short of a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student only names IRR among metrics without defining it as the rate that sets NPV to zero or showing any calculation/result. Stating the WACC is used “for all metrics” suggests confusion about IRR, which does not require a discount rate input. The DRIVER evidence shows cash flow setup but no IRR derivation or validation, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
