  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly demonstrated NPV by constructing a detailed discounted cash flow schedule that includes the negative initial outlay, PV factors, depreciation tax shields, working capital timing, and after-tax salvage, then computing and interpreting NPV. Multiple references across REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages show strong conceptual understanding and application consistent with the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to the base case and sensitivity scenarios, linking results to accept/reject implications. They integrate this within DRIVER stages (planning, implementing, and reflecting), demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines PI as PV of future cash flows divided by initial investment, applies DCF via a modeled cash flow schedule, computes PI=1.22, and interprets the >1 decision rule. This demonstrates correct concept, calculation, and managerial interpretation, meeting a thorough standard under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR (base and scenario) and interprets it versus the 8.5% hurdle, showing functional understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or describe how it is computed, falling short of a thorough treatment required for a PASS under this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed both simple and discounted payback and explained what payback measures, demonstrating solid conceptual understanding. However, they later claimed the investment pays back “under 5 years,” which contradicts their own 5.28-year result, creating an accuracy inconsistency. This prevents a PASS under a financial accuracy criterion, so the score is PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual understanding that operating cash flow should reflect taxes and the depreciation tax shield, and identifies the depreciation and tax inputs. However, they do not explicitly present or derive OCF as EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation, and their phrasing suggests adding only the tax shield to operating income, creating ambiguity. The treatment is correct but basic, without clear numerical OCF demonstration, so it merits PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly documented key real-estate and construction cost assumptions (capex, working capital, depreciation, terminal treatment, operating cost drivers) and implemented them in a model. They justified modeling choices (tax treatment of salvage, use of WACC) and connected outcomes to assumptions via sensitivity tests and conditional recommendation, demonstrating thorough, review-ready treatment."
