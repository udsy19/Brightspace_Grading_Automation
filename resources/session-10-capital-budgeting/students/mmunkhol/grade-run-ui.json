  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), quantified impacts (NPV/IRR changes), and explicitly identified the breakpoint where stakeholder preference flips (20% demand shock turning NPV negative). DRIVER stages Represent, Implement, and Validate collectively support a thorough sensitivity analysis and actionable conclusions.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they built and ran Python code, reports concrete output values (NPV, IRR, sensitivity results), and verbally validates those outputs against documented assumptions (salvage, working capital recovery, discounting). This demonstrates thorough confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrated what the tables/charts show, including columns (year, PV factor, DCF), specific results (NPV, IRR, payback), and units (millions, %, years). They also verbally explained multiple scenarios and their outputs, satisfying the requirement to describe visual outputs and scenarios. Implement and Evolve stages directly supported creating and interpreting these visuals.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or quantify debt tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs, nor compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction. It also fails to connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on a Starbucks project NPV with depreciation tax shields, which is not the required financing-tax-shield analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. All analysis centers on shareholder NPV/IRR and operational sensitivity, leaving the criterion unaddressed despite solid DRIVER execution on other fronts.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it cover bankruptcy risk or interest coverage/DSCR. It focuses on NPV/IRR using a fixed WACC and sensitivity to revenue and WACC changes. Given the absence of leverage math and risk metrics, this criterion is not met.",
