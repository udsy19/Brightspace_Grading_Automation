  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (WACC and a −20% revenue shock) and shows quantitative impacts (NPV/IRR). It also identifies explicit breakpoints and managerial triggers (e.g., negative NPV at −20% revenue; action if year‑one sales < $7M), satisfying the criterion for scenario/sensitivity analysis and stakeholder preference breakpoints.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the model and checked outputs against expectations, provides concrete results (NPV ≈ $2.6M, IRR 12.84%, payback) and explains the underlying assumptions and cash-flow logic that produce those results. This satisfies the criterion fully.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated what the charts show (cash flow timeline, payback trajectory), stated units (“millions of dollars”), and described multiple scenarios (base case, higher WACC, revenue −20%) with specific results. This sufficiently clarifies capital allocation trade-offs and implications for shareholders under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction, nor quantify interest tax shields versus distress/flexibility costs. It also lacks any connection to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Evidence shows a project-level depreciation tax shield discussion only, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. It stays within project NPV and operating risk. Under the moderate standard, at least a conceptual treatment was needed; none is provided.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. It focuses on operating leverage and WACC sensitivity using unlevered cash flows. Given the moderate standard, the absence of any conceptual treatment of DFL or financing risk warrants a FAIL.",
