  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines relevant cash flows (including initial outlay, NWC timing, and taxed salvage), discounts them at the 8.5% hurdle, and reports a computed NPV (~$2.6M). The implementation details and sensitivity analysis show thorough, correct application of NPV, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: positive NPV implies value creation and acceptance, while negative NPV under adverse scenarios implies value destruction. They discuss discounting at the hurdle rate and test multiple scenarios (base case, higher cost of capital, revenue drop), demonstrating thorough, applied understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated both simple and discounted payback with specific values and visualized the breakeven, directly addressing recovery time. They integrated these results into their decision context, showing solid conceptual understanding. A minor wording inconsistency (“six-year discounted payback”) doesn’t negate the otherwise thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and used IRR in base and stress cases and tied it to decision-making, showing solid practical application. However, they did not explain IRR conceptually as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate that relationship, so coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly indicates that a profitability index was computed and shows understanding of discounting cash flows, but provides no formula, PI value, or detailed discussion tying PV of benefits to the initial investment. Given the moderate standard, this demonstrates correct but basic treatment, warranting a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains operating cash flow as EBIT after tax plus depreciation and highlights depreciation’s non-cash tax effect, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they don’t provide detailed OCF calculations or year-by-year examples to demonstrate thorough application. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but not comprehensive, so PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover: student clearly defined the decision problem, scope, and key numeric assumptions (horizon, CAPEX, depreciation, revenue/cost structure).  \nImplement: student described the implemented function, inputs, iterative logic, and presented multiple valuation metrics and sensitivity analysis.  \nReflect: student interpreted results, discussed risks (20% revenue shock, operating leverage), and gave a conditional recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The submission provides a clear, detailed explanation across DRIVER stages: precise problem definition and assumptions (Discover), a described reproducible implementation and outputs (Implement), and a reasoned interpretation with risk discussion and recommendation (Reflect). This level of detail and linkage between analysis and decision meets the threshold for a thorough, passing treatment."
