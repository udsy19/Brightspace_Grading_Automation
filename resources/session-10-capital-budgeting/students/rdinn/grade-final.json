  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly constructs free cash flows (including initial outlay and terminal/WC effects) and applies discounting to compute NPV at the hurdle rate and other rates, with scenario analysis. They also validate and interpret the NPV results. While no numeric outputs are shown, the conceptual treatment is thorough and applied across multiple cases, meeting PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly documented depreciation and tax assumptions, described block-by-block how depreciation is calculated and added back (tax shield → free cash flow), and incorporated taxes in the operating schedule. They also validated results for financial reasonableness, showing ownership and understanding of the treatment of depreciation and taxes.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly designed, implemented, and validated sensitivity analyses (revenue -20% and multiple WACC/revenue scenarios), described block-by-block what each sensitivity cell did, and interpreted the outcomes. They claimed execution and showed ownership of results (no deflection to AI for outputs), meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes NPV at the hurdle rate and links a positive NPV to accepting the project (“green light”), showing conceptual understanding. They also consider sensitivity, which supports application. However, they do not explicitly state the NPV accept/reject rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) and hedge on the downside case rather than applying the rule, so the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and used IRR, applied it in base and downside scenarios, and validated it against WACC, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, provide method details, or show numerical results, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies how payback and discounted payback are determined (via cumulative and discounted cumulative cash flows) and notes qualitative results, showing conceptual understanding. However, they provide no explicit payback time, calculations, or deeper analysis, which is required for a thorough PASS under a moderate standard. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic.",
