  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly references running specific code cells and computing outputs (implementation quotes) and then verbally confirms those outputs align with stated assumptions and intuition (validation quotes). The discussion ties assumptions (investment, WACC, cash flows) to the observed outcomes, meeting the criterion for verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a defined Discover stage with problem statement, objectives and data, and states it must be completed prior to implementation. The student also describes represent/planning occurring \"before I wrote any code,\" and then describes implementation—meeting the strict requirement that D-stage was completed and documented before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented a pre-implementation plan (cell-by-cell models, scenarios, metrics) and then showed corresponding implemented cells that matched that plan, demonstrating systematic linkage from representation to execution. This satisfies the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of capital structure trade-offs, no quantification of tax shield from debt versus distress/flexibility costs across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, and no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Work is entirely project-level for Starbucks with depreciation tax shields, which does not satisfy this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never identifies stakeholder gain/loss tradeoffs or incentive misalignments, nor explains asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Content is strictly capital budgeting mechanics and strategic benefits. Under the moderate standard, this omission leads to a FAIL for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how financing choices affect ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Content centers on capital budgeting (NPV/IRR/payback) and operating sensitivity only. Given these gaps, it fails this criterion despite a structured DRIVER workflow.",
