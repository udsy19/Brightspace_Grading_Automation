  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the investment problem, listed key numeric parameters, and stated the decision criterion (8.5% WACC). They also provided a concrete, ordered plan (cash flows → WACC → NPV/IRR/payback → sensitivity → recommendation), meeting the strict requirement for explicit methodology.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly describes constructing year-by-year cash flows and applying valuation metrics (NPV, IRR) and sensitivity analysis, which demonstrates a clear framework for projecting cash flows and evaluating the investment. Multiple DRIVER stages (Discover, Represent, Implement, Validate) are clearly present and tied to the Represent activity, meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The presentation clearly states the project parameters, shows computed results (NPV, IRR), performs sensitivity analysis, and gives a justified recommendation—demonstrating a thorough, professional investment analysis consistent with Discover/Implement/Reflect stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows correct, basic understanding of NPV by identifying the discount rate, laying out cash flows conceptually, and reporting a positive NPV with sensitivity. However, they do not demonstrate the present value calculation or subtracting the initial outlay in detail, and they confuse NPV (a dollar value) with the hurdle rate (a percentage). This supports a satisfactory but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and ties it to the hurdle rate, including a brief sensitivity check, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, the statement comparing NPV to the hurdle rate (“NPV…higher than the hurdle rate”) conflates a dollar metric with a rate, and the treatment is brief rather than thorough. Therefore, the coverage is correct but not comprehensive, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows basic application by presenting an IRR and comparing it to WACC, indicating conceptual use. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, provide no calculation detail, and misstate units (“IR…13.25 million”), so coverage is incomplete rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.",

        "\"so the first thing we want to do is the discover phase, which is kind of just figure out what we wanted to do with the assignment here.\"",
        "\"you want to find out what your whack is. Then you want to find out what your net present value is. Then your what your IRRa is. And then compare your IRRa versus your whack. Find out what your payback period is. And then find your NPV versus the zero decision. Then do a little bit of sensitivity analysis...\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — student defined the assignment goal and laid out parameters (revenues, costs, WACC).  \nImplement — student described building cash flows, computing NPV/IRR/payback, and performed sensitivity analysis with numeric results.  \nReflect — student noted validation/limitations (\"madeup scenario...typically...validate the numbers\") and gave a clear recommendation based on results.",
      "reasoning": "The submission shows a clear, structured application of the DRIVER steps with specific data, computed metrics (NPV, IRR), and a sensitivity check that supports the recommendation. Coverage is concrete and sufficiently detailed for a moderate evaluation—beyond a brief mention but focused and complete—warranting a PASS."
