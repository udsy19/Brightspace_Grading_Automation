  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly opens with the Discover phase and documents the project scope, key parameters, and objective (accept/reject using an 8.5% WACC) before describing modeling steps. This clear, up-front D-stage meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student specified concrete data requirements and a clear sequence of analyses (cash flows → WACC → NPV/IRR → sensitivity) prior to/alongside implementation, and then reported the computed metrics, demonstrating linkage from plan to artifacts. This meets the moderate standard for a systematic methodological approach.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic implementation of the Represent plan by building year-by-year cash flows, calculating WACC/NPV/IRR, and performing sensitivity analysis that ties results back to the decision criteria. Outputs are explicit and linked to goals, meeting the moderate standard for methodological execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - No discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress costs, or flexibility across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, and no linkage to Apple’s capital structure or risk. \n- The submission centers on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis, which does not address the specified capital structure criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and does not identify who gains/loses under different choices. It also omits any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Given the absence of this content, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how leverage or financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, nor does it mention DFL, bankruptcy risk, or coverage metrics. It stays at capital budgeting (WACC/NPV/IRR) without any leverage analysis, which is required for this criterion.",
