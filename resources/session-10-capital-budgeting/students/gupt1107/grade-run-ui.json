  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states that they ran the code, printed key periods, and checked specific line items (depreciation, working capital recovery, terminal value, operating costs) against assumptions, demonstrating both execution and logical validation. Multiple concrete checks and the DRIVER validation steps show thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and repeatedly describes what the charts/tables show and explains the scenarios and units (years, dollars, percentages) tied to the visuals. Sensitivity visuals are verbally interpreted to convey trade-offs (NPV vs. WACC and revenue changes), meeting the criterion with thorough coverage across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the Define & Discover stage was performed before coding and lists comprehensive upfront inputs and assumptions. The student then documents moving those discovered inputs into a parameter dictionary and only thereafter describes implementation, satisfying the strict requirement that D-stage be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off (tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content is focused on a Starbucks project evaluation with project-level tax rate and WACC sensitivity, which is outside the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. Content is limited to project valuation and sensitivity to revenues/WACC, which does not meet the criterion’s requirements.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how financing choice changes ROE/EPS volatility or computes DFL, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Sensitivity to revenue and WACC is not leverage analysis. Thus, under the moderate standard, coverage is missing and the criterion fails.",
