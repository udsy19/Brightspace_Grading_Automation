  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly demonstrated NPV by constructing free cash flows (including initial investment, taxes, depreciation, WC recovery, and terminal value), applying the 8.5% discount rate via an NPV function, and interpreting results. Sensitivity to discount rate and revenue further shows strong conceptual understanding of present value mechanics, satisfying a comprehensive treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by referencing the hurdle rate, computing NPV, and concluding acceptance due to a positive NPV. They also deepen understanding by discussing how changes in the discount rate affect NPV and project attractiveness. Evidence across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages demonstrates a thorough, conceptually solid grasp suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and thoroughly handled both elements: treating the terminal value as an after-tax inflow and recovering working capital in year 10, and showed their inclusion in the model and validation. Multiple DRIVER stages support a clear, comprehensive treatment, satisfying the moderate category’s depth requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and referenced IRR, tied it to the hurdle rate, and used it in the accept/reject decision, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, show the calculated IRR value, or discuss computation details, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included both simple and discounted payback in their model and indicated that results were generated, demonstrating conceptual understanding and implementation. However, they did not present the actual payback period values or discuss what they imply for recovery timing, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes and computes the profitability index but provides only surface-level mention without defining it as PV of benefits divided by initial investment or showing how it was calculated. Under moderate strictness, this demonstrates basic understanding through application but lacks the depth and explanation needed for a PASS.",

Um, we'll be going through the full analytical workflow that I followed, starting with defining the business question, building a structured set of assumptions, coding a capital budgeting model in Google Collab, validating the results, and then evolving the model through sensitivity analysis, and finally reflecting on the project's financial feasibility and strategic implication.\"",
        "\"So I convert the project's financial logic and information into a planned model structure. This is really the design phase of phase of the project.\"",
        "\"I demonstrated how I defined the problem, represented the solution, implemented a full cash flow model in Python, validated the results, evolved the model through sensitivity, and reflected on the strategic meaning of the outputs.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "Discover (clearly stated business question and assumptions), Represent (structured model inputs and design), Implement (coded cash-flow functions and metrics), Validate (printed checks for years 0/1/10), Involve (sensitivity scenarios), Reflect (strategic interpretation and recommendation) — each stage is discussed and linked to outputs.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides a comprehensive, stage-by-stage DRIVER walkthrough with specific numerical assumptions, model design, code implementation, validation checks, sensitivity analysis, and a strategic recommendation. This depth and concrete evidence across multiple DRIVER stages meet the standard for a thorough, clear communication treatment."
