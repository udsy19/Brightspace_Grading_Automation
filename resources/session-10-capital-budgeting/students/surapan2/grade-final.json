  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by stating the discounting formula, correctly incorporating the initial outlay via FCF0, and computing a concrete NPV result. They extend this with sensitivity analyses (WACC, break-even), indicating comprehensive application beyond a basic mention. Under moderate strictness, this depth merits a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if ≤ 0), applies it to the base case, and extends it through sensitivity and break-even analyses, demonstrating when the project would turn unacceptable. Multiple applications and explicit validation within DRIVER show a thorough, accurate understanding that meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero and computed it (12.84%) from modeled cash flows, then applied it in decision-making against WACC and across scenarios. The discussion shows depth beyond a mention (definition, calculation via code, comparison, and use in sensitivity), meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined PI as PV of future cash flows divided by the initial outflow and reported a computed value (1.22) used in decision-making, showing conceptual understanding across Represent, Implement, and Validate. However, treatment is not thorough: there’s no detailed calculation or scenario-based PI analysis, and minor imprecision appears (“1.22 years” and “$122 per $1”). Thus, the coverage is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student conducted internal validation (calculating NPV, IRR, scenario and sensitivity analyses) but provided no external validation or comparison to named external sources/tools as required by the criterion. Under the category-specific standards (moderate), absence of explicit external references means the criterion is not met.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The submission provides a thorough, well-detailed quantitative analysis (metrics, sensitivity, break-even) but the strategic discussion—while present (mitigations, brand value, real options)—is comparatively brief and less developed. Because both sides are addressed but strategic factors lack the same depth as the quantitative work, the criterion is partially met.",

      "reasoning": "The student documents many model assumptions (capex, revenues, tax, salvage, working capital) and implements sensitivity/break-even analyses showing awareness of assumption risk, but they do not justify or validate the real estate/construction cost estimate itself (the $12M) or provide supporting cost breakdowns or external validation. Given correct but incomplete documentation and limited justification of the specific real estate/construction cost, the work meets a partial standard."
