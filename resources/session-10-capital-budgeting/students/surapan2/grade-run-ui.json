  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%, best/base/worst) and explicitly calculated the break-even revenue (-9.32% MPV=0), demonstrating the stakeholder-preference breakpoint. Implementation and validation via the DRIVER stages (model, code, MPV/IRR outputs) support a thorough sensitivity and scenario treatment, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and debugged the code in Colab and verbally confirmed outputs matched the stated metrics (MPV = 2.69M, IRR > WACC). They also explained key assumptions and how cash flows/terminal value were computed, and performed sensitivity checks, demonstrating thorough validation of execution and results.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables/charts show, referencing specific figures, time units (years), currency (millions), and scenario percentages, and interprets sensitivity/MPV profile outputs. Multiple examples across scenarios and the cash flow table demonstrate thorough coverage consistent with the DRIVER Represent/Evolve stages, meeting a PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of capital structure tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor any connection to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content is limited to a Starbucks capital budgeting analysis with operating tax effects (depreciation), not financing choices.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is present; the work focuses solely on project valuation metrics and revenue sensitivity.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It remains at the project (asset) level using NPV/IRR/PI/payback and revenue/WACC sensitivities without capital structure, interest coverage, or bankruptcy considerations. Under the rubric, this misses the criterion entirely, hence FAIL.",
