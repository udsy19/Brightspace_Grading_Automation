  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV by constructing year-by-year cash flows, explicitly treating the initial outlay, and discounting future cash flows at the 8.5% WACC. They computed base-case NPV and explored its sensitivity to both discount rate and revenues, demonstrating strong conceptual and practical understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0 at the hurdle rate) and applies it to the base case and sensitivity scenarios. They compute and interpret NPVs across conditions and link them to accept/reject implications, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR, identified it as the NPV–discount-rate cross, and provided a base-case value (~13.3%) plus a sensitivity-case value (~3.2%), demonstrating understanding and application. Multiple DRIVER stages show method, implementation, and interpretation, meeting thoroughness for a PASS despite a minor phrasing slip elsewhere.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the OCF structure as NOPAT (i.e., EBIT after tax) plus depreciation and identifies the annual depreciation, showing conceptual accuracy. However, they do not provide a detailed, numeric demonstration of EBIT × (1 − T) + Depreciation or sample year calculations, so coverage is correct but basic. Under moderate strictness, this merits a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both salvage/terminal value and working capital recovery in the terminal-year cash flow and explicitly notes treating the $3M as after-tax. However, they do not detail the tax computation (e.g., depreciation recapture implications) or reconcile the “after-tax” statement with adding the full $3M in the FCF formula, leaving gaps in depth. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic, meriting a PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student shows personal implementation and block-level understanding (Represent and Implement) and validated outputs, and they executed downside scenario testing (Evolve). However, they did not present an explicit best-case (upside revenue) scenario — only a base case, a revenue -20% downside, and WACC variations — so scenario modeling is incomplete per the strict criterion.",
