  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran the base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC +/-2%), reported NPV/IRR/payback/PI impacts, and explicitly identified breakpoints where accept/reject shifts (revenue shortfall flipping NPV negative; NPV crossing at ~13.3% IRR). This is a thorough, well-documented sensitivity analysis satisfying the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports executing the model and cites produced metrics (NPV, IRR, payback). They describe concrete validation steps—inspecting free cash flow patterns, plotting NPV vs discount rate to confirm the IRR, and running sensitivity tests—while tying outputs back to stated assumptions, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student performed structured sensitivity tests on major value drivers (revenue and discount rate), quantified impacts on NPV, IRR, payback, and PI, and explained implications for robustness and risk. The model was explicitly set up to enable such testing, and the reflection ties results to decision-making, meeting the thoroughness needed for a PASS in this moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction, nor quantify tax shield benefits or expected distress/optionality costs. It focuses on Starbucks project valuation and never connects to Apple’s capital structure or risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing or payout choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The work is focused on project cash flows and sensitivity only. Given the criterion’s requirements, this is missing and merits a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs. equity financing affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. While the DRIVER stages are applied to NPV/IRR and sensitivity, the criterion-specific leverage analysis is missing, so this fails.",
