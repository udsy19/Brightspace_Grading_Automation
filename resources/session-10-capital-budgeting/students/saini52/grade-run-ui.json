  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built sensitivity testing into the model (function-based scenario runs) across multiple key drivers (revenue growth, COGS, WACC) and presented outputs (NPV/IRR tables). They also explained implications for decision-making and risk focus (e.g., quantifying WACC sensitivity and highlighting revenue/COGS as high-impact), satisfying the criterion with depth appropriate for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documents the project definition (parameters, stakeholders/objectives implied by assignment scope) and states that the model development follows \"with all those project parameters defined,\" demonstrating the D-stage was completed before modeling. Evidence is direct and sequential, meeting the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented the planned models, inputs, and metrics (represent stage) and described/produced the implemented artifacts (annual cash flow printout, NPV/IRR, sensitivity runs), with validation steps noted. This demonstrates a systematic plan and linkage from plan to implementation, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress/optionality costs, or comparisons across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, and it never references Apple’s current balance sheet or risk. Given the criterion’s requirements, even a conceptual treatment is absent, so the student fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Even under moderate strictness, the criterion requires at least conceptual treatment, which is absent; the work focuses solely on project cash flows, metrics, and sensitivity.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or calculation of financial leverage effects (DFL), ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and related coverage metrics. Despite a solid cash flow/NPV/IRR and sensitivity workflow (Discover/Implement/Reflect), the criterion is missing, so it fails under the moderate standard.",
