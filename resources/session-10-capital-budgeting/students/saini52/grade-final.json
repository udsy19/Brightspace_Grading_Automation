  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides block-by-block explanations of the cash-flow construction for all 10 years and shows the model output across the project life, while also stating they independently tested equations and examples to verify correctness. Although initial code generation used Gemini, the student explicitly validated results and demonstrated understanding of the projections, meeting the strict requirements for personal verification and comprehension.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described correct depreciation treatment (straight-line, zero after useful life), proper tax computation (tax = max(0, EBIT*rate)), and adding depreciation back to operating cash flow, and they reported personally verifying the results with examples. Although AI-generated code was used, the student demonstrated block-by-block understanding and personal validation, meeting the strict requirements.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly executed sensitivity analyses on key assumptions (revenue growth, COGS, WACC), described the implementation approach (function + loops), and validated outputs by running manual example checks and interpreting results—meeting the strict requirements for personal execution, block‑level understanding, and ownership.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set up free cash flows including the initial outflow and stated that an NPV function using the 8.5% WACC was implemented, with sensitivity analyses performed, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they did not provide a thorough explanation or explicit present value calculations/derivations for NPV, so coverage is basic rather than comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed NPV and used positive NPV outcomes to recommend acceptance, showing basic understanding of the decision context. However, they did not explicitly articulate the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0, indifferent at 0) or discuss boundary cases, making the treatment correct but not thorough. Therefore, this meets a Partial standard under the moderate criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported IRR values (including in sensitivity analysis), demonstrating basic conceptual application. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show how it is solved, and phrasing like “NPV divided by IRR” suggests limited depth. Therefore, the treatment is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
