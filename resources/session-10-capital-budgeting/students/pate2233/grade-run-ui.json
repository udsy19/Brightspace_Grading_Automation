  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes executing the code, resolving errors, and reporting numeric outputs (NPV, IRR, payback). They verbally confirm key assumptions and check that computed values (depreciation, COGS, taxes) align with expectations and benchmark rates, demonstrating thorough validation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed and documented the Define & Discover stage at the start (problem, objectives, given data) and then proceeded to representation and implementation, so the D-stage was not missing or post-hoc. This meets the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented model components, data inputs, scenarios (revenue -20%, alternative WACCs), and target metrics before coding and then described implementing those same elements in Python to produce NPV/IRR, paybacks, sensitivity tables, and plots. This clear mapping from plan to implemented artifacts meets the REPRESENT criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off, provide any quantification of tax shields vs. distress/flexibility costs, or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Despite use of DRIVER stages, the content is unrelated to the specified criterion, so it fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts or incentives across stakeholders, nor asset substitution or risk‑shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. It centers on NPV/IRR and “adding shareholder value” without discussing bondholders, management, employees, or large holders and their potentially divergent incentives. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It provides only project NPV/IR/payback and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, with no leverage math or coverage/bankruptcy discussion. Given the complete omission of the criterion, this is a fail despite acceptable conceptual treatment being allowed.",
