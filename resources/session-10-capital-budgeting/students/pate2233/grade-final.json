  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly automated capital budgeting calculations, detailing how Python constructs cash flows, computes NPV/IRR/PI/payback, and runs sensitivity scenarios, and reported concrete outputs. The workflow shows strong finance-tech integration and forward-looking enhancements across Discover, Implement, and Evolve stages. Coverage is comprehensive enough to satisfy a knowledgeable reviewer.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student models multi-phase cash flows explicitly (different revenue phases, first-year vs later treatments, working capital recovery and terminal value) and implements them in code, validating key mechanics like taxes and depreciation. The treatment is comprehensive and applied, reflecting strong understanding across Discover, Implement, and Evolve stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student articulates a complete, systematic investment evaluation framework: defining objectives, specifying inputs/assumptions, computing core metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback), and conducting sensitivity and validation. They further outline concrete model enhancements, evidencing depth beyond a basic discussion. Discover, Implement, and Evolve stages are all present and applied coherently.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies NPV mechanics by discounting cash flows (“present value FCF”) at 8.5% and explicitly including the $12M initial outflow, reporting NPV ≈ $3.0M with sensitivity analysis—showing solid conceptual grasp. However, accuracy is undermined by inconsistent inputs (e.g., terminal value listed as 30M earlier vs. “3 million” later) and other parameter slips (e.g., COGS cited as 4% elsewhere), so the treatment is correct but not consistently accurate or thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule and applies it to make an accept decision with NPV ≈ $3M, and acknowledges how WACC/revenue changes affect NPV. However, treatment is basic: they don’t explicitly articulate the reject/indifference cases or walk through decisions under sensitivity scenarios, and there’s minor imprecision (“negative FPV”). This supports a correct but not thorough understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student computed and reported an IRR and discussed discount-rate sensitivity, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero nor demonstrate the zero-NPV crossover; the NPV–WACC discussion focuses on an intersection near $3M, not where NPV equals zero. This meets a correct but incomplete standard, meriting PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
