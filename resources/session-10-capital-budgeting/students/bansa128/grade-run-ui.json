  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly references running code (displaying year-by-year cash flows and metrics) and reports concrete model outputs used for validation. They also enumerate key assumptions (CapEx, depreciation, revenues, WACC) and connect them to the reported results and sensitivity checks, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly presents the D-stage first with a clear problem statement, scope, and decision rule, then moves to R and later to I/implementation. The student also documents the DRIVER summary in their code, demonstrating Define/Discover was completed and recorded before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission explicitly documents a pre-implementation plan (assumptions and required data) and then demonstrates a systematic implementation that uses those inputs to produce year-by-year cash flows, NPV/IRR metrics, and sensitivity analysis. This clear linkage from Represent to Implement (and validation of outputs) meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or Apple. It neither quantifies tax advantages and distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives nor links conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. Mentions of a depreciation tax shield and WACC pertain to project evaluation, not capital structure, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. While it references shareholders and lenders in the context of WACC, there is no depth or conceptual discussion of who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financing choice effects on ROE/EPS, does not compute or explain DFL, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. The work remains at an unlevered capital budgeting level (WACC, NPV/IRR) with only a generic nod to “higher financing costs,” which is insufficient for this criterion under the moderate standard.",
