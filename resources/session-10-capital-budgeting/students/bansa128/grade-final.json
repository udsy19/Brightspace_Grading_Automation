  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct NPV approach: identifies initial outlay, models and discounts future FCF at WACC, includes WC and terminal value, and reports the computed NPV. The workflow is clearly tied to DRIVER stages and supported by specific figures, meeting the depth needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately stated the NPV decision rule and applied it to base-case results and sensitivity scenarios, then used it to make a clear accept/reject recommendation. The discussion includes the correct discount rate context and multiple applications (base case and sensitivities), demonstrating a strong, thorough grasp suitable for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student demonstrates automated capital budgeting by referencing code-generated year-by-year cash flows, automated computation of NPV/IRR/payback, and scenario sensitivities. This reflects a thorough, technology-enabled implementation and validation consistent with the Implement and Validate/Execute stages, with Evolve suggesting further automated extensions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR and applies the proper decision rule, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, they do not explain or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor provide methodological detail, which limits depth. Hence, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported both discounted and undiscounted payback periods and built a year-by-year cash flow model, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain how the payback was derived (e.g., cumulative cash flow crossover, treatment of working capital recovery or terminal value) or interpret its implications. The coverage is correct but basic, meeting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a Profitability Index and demonstrated use of discounted cash flows and the initial outlay, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain how PI is calculated (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show the calculation steps or components, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.
