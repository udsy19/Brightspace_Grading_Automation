  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission provides a clear base-case NPV and explores multiple sensitivities (lower operating cash flows, higher discount rates) including a documented downside breakpoint where NPV turns negative, which signals a stakeholder decision shift. The scenarios are specific and connected to the DRIVER Validate stage, meeting the criterion for thorough scenario and sensitivity analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly frames the problem and strategic question in the Discover section before moving to Represent and Implement (modeling) stages. This sequential, documented ordering meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission clearly documents the planned models, scenarios, and required data (staged cash flows, WACC, salvage, working capital) and then implements that plan by computing NPV and discussing sensitivities. This demonstrates a systematic linkage from representation to implementation consistent with the DRIVER framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project NPV for an unrelated firm (UrbanCharge) and never addresses capital structure trade-offs, tax shield benefits, distress/optionality costs, or the buyback/dividend/debt reduction choice set. It also does not reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Despite clear DRIVER use, the required criterion is missing; hence, Fail.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing or payout choices, or the asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage and buybacks. The work focuses solely on NPV and sensitivity; thus, despite completing DRIVER steps, it fails to meet this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice impacts ROE/EPS volatility. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. While it applies DRIVER to NPV/WACC, it fails to address the criterion’s required leverage math and risk implications.",
