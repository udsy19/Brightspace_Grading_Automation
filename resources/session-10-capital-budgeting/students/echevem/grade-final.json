  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV by specifying all cash flows, discount rate, and working capital/terminal value, then explicitly computing PV of inflows and NPV. They also situated this within DRIVER stages and added sensitivity validation, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule—positive NPV implies value creation and acceptance—and ties it to an execution decision. They compute and interpret NPV, and discuss sensitivity that could turn NPV negative, demonstrating robust conceptual understanding across Implement, Validate, and Execute stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student provides multiple concrete scenario and sensitivity variations (cash flow reductions, WACC increases, combined downside) and interprets their impact on NPV, showing depth beyond a surface mention. This aligns with the DRIVER Validate step and applies results to decision-making, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never defines, computes, or conceptually discusses IRR as the rate that makes NPV equal zero; it only performs an NPV analysis at the given WACC with sensitivity tests. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual explanation would suffice, but even that is absent, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not calculate or discuss the payback period or the time required to recover the initial $42 million outlay. While the Represent stage provides sufficient cash flow data, the Implement and Validate stages exclusively cover NPV, leaving the payback criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculates PV of inflows and identifies the initial outlay but does not compute the profitability index or explain its interpretation. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, yet PI is omitted entirely in favor of NPV, so the criterion is not met.",
