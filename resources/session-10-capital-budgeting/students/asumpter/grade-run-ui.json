  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows the student executed the planned analysis end-to-end: they described the Represent plan, ran and debugged code during Implement, and reported validation outputs (stress scenarios and duration estimates). Intermediate checks and a clear link from plan to results demonstrate a systematic methodological execution consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on bond portfolio construction and duration/credit trade-offs for a pension fund, not on capital structure choices (buybacks vs dividends vs debt reduction), tax shield quantification, or distress/flexibility costs. There is no connection to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, the required capital structure trade-off analysis is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on bond portfolio construction, duration matching, and coding workflow, with no analysis of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders. It also does not address asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Thus, it fails to demonstrate the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on bond portfolio construction, duration matching, and credit quality, with no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the absence of these required elements, even at a conceptual level, the criterion is not met.",
