  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student applies a systematic framework by defining objectives, building a diversified portfolio, and conducting structured stress tests across rate and spread risks, then interpreting results via duration and liability matching. The inclusion of scenario outcomes, modified/Macaulay duration, and credit-quality considerations demonstrates depth beyond a surface mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission shows a systematic implementation: data assembled into a portfolio matrix, code executed and debugged, and scenario-based sensitivity analysis (multiple interest-rate shocks and credit-spread widening) with duration-derived price-change estimates. This meets the moderate DRIVER standard for a systematic NPV/price-sensitivity implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not mention or compute NPV, nor does it conceptually explain discounting cash flows and subtracting the initial investment. While the student discusses duration and rate/credit shocks, those do not satisfy the NPV criterion, even under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on bond portfolio construction, duration matching, and rate/credit stress tests, with no mention or application of the NPV decision rule. Given the absence of any conceptual or applied discussion of accepting/rejecting projects based on NPV, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion, calculation, or conceptual explanation of IRR or the NPV=0 condition. Content focuses on duration, yield, and credit spreads. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but IRR is missing entirely, warranting a FAIL.",
