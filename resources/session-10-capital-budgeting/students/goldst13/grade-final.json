  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applied NPV by modeling the initial outlay, including terminal value and WC recovery, and discounting cash flows at the WACC, reporting a base-case NPV and sensitivity NPV outcomes. They demonstrated depth via multiple scenarios and explicit inclusion of key cash flow components, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to base and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating when to accept and when the project would be underwater. They integrate this into the recommendation, showing thorough, applied understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly automated the cash flow model and capital budgeting metrics using a Python script and documented the logic, then applied automation to scenario analysis. This demonstrates thorough, integrated use of technology for capital budgeting beyond surface-level discussion, satisfying the criterion under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, reported specific values, and showed how IRR changes under sensitivity, demonstrating sound conceptual use. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or describe the computation method in depth, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and interpreted the simple payback period and linked it to the cash flow profile, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is brief with no explanation of the computation (e.g., cumulative cash flow crossing point) or contrast with discounted payback, leaving gaps for a thorough evaluation. Hence, PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and interprets the PI (1.32 implies PV benefits per $1 invested) and references the initial investment, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not detail the calculation (PV of benefits breakdown) or provide deeper discussion/examples. Thus, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL.",
