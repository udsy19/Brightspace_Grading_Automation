  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, presents concrete outputs (NPV, IRR) and describes the model assumptions and cash-flow logic that explain those results, including sensitivity tests. This is a thorough verbal confirmation aligning Represent, Implement, and Validate stages, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly verbalizes what the charts show, cites specific values and units ($, %, years), and explains scenarios (WACC up 2%, revenue down 20%). Multiple visuals are interpreted with decision-relevant implications, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment under a moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built and discussed sensitivity tests on key drivers (WACC and revenue/FCF variability) and clearly explained how outcomes change the project’s risk profile and recommendation (conditional acceptance). While tax rate wasn’t tested, the EVOLVE-stage analysis is thorough enough under the moderate standard to demonstrate meaningful stress testing.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or quantify tax benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction options, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Mention of a depreciation tax shield pertains to project accounting, not leverage-related tax shields. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - No discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and no treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite a solid DRIVER-based valuation, the agency-conflict criterion is missing, warranting a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics appears; the analysis focuses on project valuation and operating risk sensitivity only. Given the criterion specifically requires leverage math and risk implications of financing choice, the required concepts are missing despite a solid DRIVER-based project evaluation.",
