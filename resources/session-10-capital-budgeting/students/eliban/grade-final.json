  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructed and validated NPV by modeling cash flows (including initial outlay and WC), applying the 8.5% discount rate via a proper NPV function, and reporting base-case and sensitivity NPVs. Multiple stages (Represent, Implement, Validate, Reflect) substantiate accurate NPV calculation and nuanced interpretation, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule and applies it to base case and multiple sensitivity scenarios, correctly linking positive NPV to acceptance and negative NPV to rejection risk. Using Validate, Evolve, and Reflect stages, they demonstrate thorough, applied understanding of when to accept or reject based on NPV, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined and applied unlevered free cash flow as NOPAT plus depreciation minus capex and working capital changes, and validated the treatment at launch and in the terminal year. The discussion is specific and thorough enough to demonstrate strong conceptual and applied understanding, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed IRR using appropriate tools and applied the IRR vs WACC decision rule, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic: no explanation that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, and no IRR sensitivity or deeper analysis, with emphasis mainly on NPV. Hence, this meets a basic standard but not the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never determines or discusses the time required to recover the initial investment (no cumulative cash flow or payback calculation). While NPV/IRR analysis is thorough, payback period is missing entirely, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates NPV and IRR thoroughly but contains no mention, calculation, or conceptual discussion of the Profitability Index. Given the criterion specifically requires calculating PV of benefits divided by initial investment, and moderate standards still require at least a conceptual treatment, the absence of PI results in a fail.",
