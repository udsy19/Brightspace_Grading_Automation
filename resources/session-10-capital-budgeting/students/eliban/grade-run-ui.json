  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (cost of capital sweep and a −20% revenue shock), reported numerical NPVs (base positive, −20% → ≈ −$1.9M) and explicitly flagged the breakpoint where the decision flips, then tied this to a conditional recommendation. This is a thorough, specific treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the code was run and presents specific validation checks (capex + working capital, depreciation, NPV/IRR and sensitivity results). These concrete checks across Represent/Implement/Validate demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables/charts show and explains units and scenarios (millions, percentages, years, WACC levels, -20% revenue). Multiple visuals are described and interpreted to illuminate capital allocation trade-offs, satisfying a thorough treatment for a PASS in a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs, nor does it compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives or quantify their effects. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Even under a moderate standard, there is no conceptual treatment of the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR modeling and sensitivity, with no discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Under moderate standards, the core criterion is missing, so this earns a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage and NPV/IRR sensitivity but does not address financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or how financing choice affects downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the criterion specifically requires leverage math and financing-risk discussion, the coverage is missing, resulting in a FAIL.",
