  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports executing code and gives a numeric NPV result, then verbally validates that result by checking inputs (investment, operating cash flows, terminal value), the chosen discount rate (8.5% WACC), and decision logic, plus sensitivity scenarios. This is a thorough, coherent demonstration of valid code execution and result validation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly performs Define & Discover up front, naming the decision question, stakeholders, and objective (MVP > 0 at Apple's WACC). The student then moves to implementation, so the D-stage is documented and completed before modeling, meeting the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented the represent-stage plan (cash-flow timeline and explicit CF0), specified required data and decision metric (NPV), and then implemented that plan in a Python script while describing scenario testing. This systematic plan-to-implementation linkage meets the moderate DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires quantifying tax shield benefits versus expected distress and flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives and connecting the trade-off to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The submission focuses solely on project NPV using WACC, with no discussion or quantification of capital structure trade-offs, tax advantages, distress/optionality costs, or Apple’s current leverage/liquidity position. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The focus is solely on NPV/WACC, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV and discount-rate sensitivity without discussing leverage math (DFL), how debt vs. equity financing would alter EPS/ROE volatility, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Even at a moderate strictness, there is no conceptual treatment of financing choice effects or downside risk, so the criterion is not met.",
