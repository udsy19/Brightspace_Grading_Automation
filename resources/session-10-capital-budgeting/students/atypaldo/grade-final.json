  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and correctly states the NPV accept/reject rule and applies it to a concrete project, concluding acceptance when NPV is positive. They further verify the components and explore sensitivity, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention. These DRIVER stages collectively show thorough understanding suitable for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly models multi-phase cash flows (ramp-up, full production, decline, and a terminal sale), translates them into a timeline, and implements them in code, then verifies completeness and performs sensitivity analysis. This shows thorough, applied understanding of multi-phase cash flow modeling within the DRIVER framework. Minor transcription slips do not detract from the comprehensive treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a thorough, structured capital budgeting framework: defining the decision, laying out cash flows, applying WACC and the NPV decision rule, implementing in Python, and verifying inputs and logic, then extending to sensitivities. This end-to-end, multi-stage treatment demonstrates a systematic investment evaluation framework consistent with the DRIVER method, meeting the PASS standard in a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a solid conceptual grasp of NPV, lays out cash flows, states the formula and decision rule, and implements a computation yielding ~$2.1B, supported by verification and sensitivity discussion. However, multiple numeric inaccuracies (e.g., CF0 as -20,000 vs. -2,000; inconsistent cash flow list) undermine accuracy, so the treatment is correct but not thorough/clean enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV and does not compute or explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero. Under moderate strictness, a conceptual explanation would suffice, but IRR is only mentioned as a future task with no method, calculation, or interpretation provided.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion specifically requires determining the payback period. The submission does not mention or compute the time required to recover the initial investment, nor does it conceptually discuss payback. Despite solid NPV work across DRIVER stages, the payback period is omitted, resulting in a fail for this criterion.",
