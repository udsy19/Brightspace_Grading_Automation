  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly names the investment (Starbucks), lists assumptions/parameters and initial investment, and states decision criteria (NPV, IRR vs. WACC) with numeric results and a recommendation—meeting the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a systematic execution: computing depreciation, building a 0–10 cash flow schedule, implementing the model in Python, and producing NPV/IRR outputs with sensitivity considerations. These elements meet the moderate standard for a PASS under the Implement criterion.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student explicitly applied and narrated the DRIVER stages, produced quantitative outputs (NPV, IRR) and documented the computational method (Python), and linked insights to decision recommendations. This demonstrates a thorough, communicative treatment meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct, applied understanding of NPV by referencing WACC-based discounting over years 0–10, the initial investment, and reporting a specific NPV used for a go/no-go decision. However, the treatment lacks depth and clarity (e.g., no explicit PV mechanics and a confusing reuse of 1,200,000 as both depreciation and initial investment), so it is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly ties a positive NPV to an accept decision and shows they computed NPV, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly articulate the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if < 0, indifferent at 0) or discuss edge cases, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR (10.98%) alongside NPV and references WACC, showing basic understanding and application. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero nor demonstrate how it was computed or validated, leaving gaps in depth required for a PASS.",
