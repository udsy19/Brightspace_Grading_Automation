  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, the company (Starbucks), and revenue assumptions before showing the Python modeling, and the student narrates the DRIVER stages. This demonstrates Define/Discover completed and documented prior to modeling, meeting the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student documented assumptions, a cash-flow driver map, and scenario considerations (years 0–10, sensitivity ranges) before analysis and then implemented those elements in Python to produce NPV/IRR results. This shows a clear plan and direct linkage from representation to implemented artifacts, meeting the moderate DRIVER standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic implementation: they translated the Represent plan into a Python model, executed multi-year NCF calculations, and reported validation outputs (WACC/NPV/IRR) and sensitivity checks. These elements meet the moderate standard for a clear, traceable methodological execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on capital budgeting (NPV/IRR, WACC) for Starbucks and does not discuss, quantify, or compare tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs for buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction. It also fails to connect any trade-off conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Despite using the DRIVER method, the criterion is not addressed, resulting in a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and does not identify who gains/loses under different financing or payout choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The work centers on NPV/IRR/WACC and generic “risks,” so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It centers on NPV/IRR/WACC and project acceptance, leaving the criterion unmet despite use of the DRIVER method.",
