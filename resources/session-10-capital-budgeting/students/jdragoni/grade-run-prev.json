  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructed free cash flows, applied depreciation and taxes, discounted the terminal and yearly cash flows to compute a quantitative NPV (2.69M) and performed sensitivity analysis. The depth and specificity of the cash-flow construction, discounting, and robustness checks meet the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student states the NPV decision rule explicitly, applies it quantitatively (NPV = $2.69M; IRR > WACC), and conducts sensitivity analyses showing conditions that flip NPV negative. This clear definition plus applied calculations and robustness checks meet the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a specific IRR (12.84%), applied it correctly against the 8.5% hurdle, and incorporated that result into the project recommendation and sensitivity analysis. The IRR calculation and application are explicit and used across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports numeric NPV and IRR results and references an implemented model, they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, or ownership of the code (instead citing Gemini assistance). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration of running/verifying code and explaining its components, the submission fails to meet the required evidence of correct technical implementation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents detailed cash‑flow figures and a timeline (Represent) and references a coded implementation (Implement), but does not explicitly demonstrate that they personally ran, verified, or can explain the code step‑by‑step. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and ownership of code, the submission fails to provide the required evidence of accurate, independently validated cash‑flow projections.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly calculated and applied straight‑line depreciation, used EBIT×(1−T) and added back depreciation in operating cash flows, and treated terminal sale net of tax and working‑capital recovery—demonstrating correct conceptual and numerical treatment. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block‑by‑block code/verification (they reference Gemini/code but do not show ownership or stepwise explanation), so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
