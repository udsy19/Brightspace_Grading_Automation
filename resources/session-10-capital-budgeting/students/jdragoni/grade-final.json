  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly and accurately calculated NPV by specifying initial outflows, yearly free cash flows (including depreciation tax shields), working capital recovery, terminal value with taxes, and discounting at the stated WACC, culminating in NPV = 2.69 million. The DRIVER stages show construction, execution, and reflection on the NPV analysis. Minor slips (e.g., a tax typo) do not undermine the correctness or depth of the NPV treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0), applies it to the base case, and demonstrates understanding via sensitivity analysis showing the reject threshold as WACC rises. They also connect IRR vs WACC correctly. Minor phrasing imprecision is outweighed by comprehensive, accurate treatment across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately reported both simple (≈5.3 years) and discounted (≈8.2 years) payback and correctly interpreted their meaning (cash recovery vs. value break-even), tying results to backloaded cash flows and early-exit risk. This reflects a thorough, conceptually sound treatment across Implement and Validation stages, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR (12.84%) and linked it to the accept/reject rule versus WACC, and their sensitivity analysis shows NPV crossing zero near 13%, consistent with the IRR. However, they did not explicitly define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation beyond tool output, so coverage is correct but not thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports a PI of 1.22, indicating they calculated the metric, which supports basic understanding. However, they misinterpret it as $122 per $1 instead of $1.22 and do not explicitly show or discuss the formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). This prevents a thorough PASS but merits PARTIAL for demonstrating the metric with some conceptual grasp.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct-seeming NPV and IRR results and clearly explained the cash-flow construction and validation checks (Represent and Validate). However, under the strict Technical Implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution and block-by-block code understanding (e.g., “I ran and verified this code” or stepwise explanation of each code block); they relied on AI assistance and implied running the code without clear ownership.

      "reasoning": "The student correctly applied Starbucks' WACC as the benchmark and compared project returns (IRR, payback) against it, showing conceptual understanding and sensitivity testing. However, they did not provide broader industry benchmark data or comparative retail return statistics beyond a brief qualitative remark, so treatment is correct but not thorough."
