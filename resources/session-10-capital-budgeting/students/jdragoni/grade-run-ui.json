  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced a clear base-case NPV and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses (WACC, revenue, terminal value), identified specific breakpoints (e.g., NPV turns negative ~13% WACC and with large revenue declines), and discussed implications. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly says the code exists and is run, reports concrete outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) and performs sensitivity/validation analysis tying results back to stated assumptions (terminal value, revenue scenarios). This meets the criterion for verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching explanation of logic, so a PASS is warranted.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the charts/tables show (PV factors over time; WACC and revenue sensitivity curves) and states the units and scenarios (percent WACC, percent revenue changes, NPV in millions). They also connect these visuals to stakeholder implications and capital allocation trade-offs (accept/reject thresholds, shareholder value sensitivity), meeting a thorough, multi-example standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses depreciation tax shields in a project/lease-vs-buy context but does not quantify debt tax shields versus financial distress/flexibility costs, nor compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also omits any connection to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts across stakeholders, nor does it address asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. References to “shareholder value” are generic and do not identify who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. Therefore, despite solid DRIVER execution on NPV, this criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage and NPV versus WACC but does not address financial leverage mechanics (DFL), EPS/ROE sensitivity to EBIT, or coverage/bankruptcy risk under varying debt levels. No leverage math (DFL/EPS/ROE) or coverage metrics are presented, so the criterion is not demonstrated despite broader DRIVER work.",
