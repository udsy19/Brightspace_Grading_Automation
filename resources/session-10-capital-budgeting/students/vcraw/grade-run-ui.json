  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and cross-checked results in Excel, and they verbally explain the calculation logic and assumptions (tax rate, depreciation, cash-flow construction) that produce the reported metrics. These DRIVER stages (IMPLEMENT and VALIDATE, supported by REPRESENT) provide clear, specific evidence of valid code execution and result validation, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures problem statement, acceptance objectives, financial hurdle, and initial assumptions up front before describing the model and calculations. That clear, front-loaded discovery satisfies the requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student defined a clear pre-implementation plan (decision rule, metrics: NPV/IRR, cash-flow structure) and executed it (built the cash-flow model, computed metrics, ran sensitivity scenarios) with explicit linkage to implementation via code and validation in Excel. This meets the moderate-standard requirement for systematic planning and mapping to implemented artifacts.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off, provides no quantification of tax advantages vs. expected distress/flexibility costs for buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, and makes no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. The work centers on Starbucks project evaluation metrics (UFC, NPV, IRR, WACC sensitivity), which is unrelated to the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, despite solid modeling steps, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, stakeholder risk preferences, bankruptcy risk, or coverage metrics. Analysis centers on unlevered cash flows, WACC, and basic sensitivity on revenue/WACC, leaving the leverage criterion unaddressed.",
