You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines and applies NPV, specifies the discount rate, includes the initial outlay, and reports a concrete NPV result, demonstrating more than basic understanding. Sensitivity analysis and verification indicate thorough implementation and reflection, satisfying a comprehensive treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV accept/reject rule, correctly defines and applies NPV using the WACC, and bases the recommendation on a positive NPV, reinforced by sensitivity scenarios. The discussion is specific with figures and demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero and provides specific computed IRR values, applying them in both base and stressed scenarios. They also interpret IRR against the hurdle rate to support the decision, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the discounted payback period and reported a specific result (7.76 years), showing conceptual understanding and implementation. However, they did not provide a cumulative discounted cash flow buildup, intermediate steps, or interpretive discussion (e.g., relation to the 10-year life), so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Under the moderate standard, this merits PARTIAL, not PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of inflows divided by PV of outflows and provides a PI value, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the underlying PV computations, tie the denominator explicitly to the initial outlay, or analyze PI under scenarios, making the treatment brief rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines free cash flow as NOPAT + depreciation and applies it in the year-2 example, omitting the required deductions for capital expenditures and changes in working capital. Although they acknowledge initial working capital and terminal recovery, their stated UFCF formula is inaccurate for the criterion, which requires operating cash flow less capex and working capital changes.
