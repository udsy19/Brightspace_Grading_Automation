  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV accept/reject rule (NPV > 0 → acceptable) and applies it with computed results, including sensitivity scenarios showing negative NPV implications. They also connect NPV to WACC and use the outputs to inform an accept/reject recommendation, demonstrating thorough and accurate understanding across Implement and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined both simple and discounted payback, implemented calculations, and reported concrete results supported by a year-by-year cash flow schedule. This demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of determining the time required to recover the initial investment, meeting the moderate standard for depth.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined PI as PV of future inflows divided by initial outlay, computed a base-case value (~1.2–1.24), and interpreted the >1 threshold in the decision context. This shows solid conceptual understanding and applied calculation within the DRIVER framework, satisfying a thorough treatment for a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Although the student set up cash flows correctly (including the initial outlay and terminal adjustments) and discussed NPV conceptually, they explicitly applied an incorrect present value formula (linear discounting 1 + r·t instead of compound discounting (1 + r)^t). This fundamental accuracy error invalidates the NPV calculation, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly defined IRR, implemented it, and used results to compare against WACC and under sensitivity—showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment lacks depth on computation mechanics (methodology, potential issues like multiple IRRs) and relies on vague implementation notes, so coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly modeled key incremental cash flows (initial outlay, working capital, operating cash flow via EBIT-tax+dep, WC recovery, terminal value) and avoided financing items, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly justify inclusion/exclusion decisions (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, cannibalization/opportunity costs), so coverage is correct but basic rather than comprehensive.",
