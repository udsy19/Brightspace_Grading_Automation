  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student verbally confirmed executing code in their Colab notebook, reported specific numeric outputs (NPV, IRR, payback, PI), and described validation steps tying results back to assumptions and visualizations. They also ran sensitivity scenarios and noted how outputs changed, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the visuals show, cites specific values with units (millions, %, years), and explains scenarios (base case, revenue -20%, WACC shifts) while interpreting the plotted relationships. This goes beyond surface mention and provides multiple concrete examples, meeting the moderate standard for a thorough PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the problem, objectives, and key parameters before describing the modeling approach and implementation, and the student notes a documented \"driver walkthrough\" prior to coding. There is no indication the Discover stage was missing or applied post-hoc, so the criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks project capital budgeting and does not address the required capital structure trade-off (tax shield benefits vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Given the absence of both quantification and conceptual discussion on this criterion, it fails under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts across stakeholders, does not identify who gains/loses under different choices, and does not discuss asset substitution or risk-shifting via leverage/buybacks. Focus remains on NPV/IRR and qualitative brand benefits, so the criterion is missing despite DRIVER elements being used elsewhere.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, DFL, or downside risk. There is no leverage math, no discussion of bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios, and no stakeholder preference linkage—only operating-risk sensitivity. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but leverage is missing entirely, so this criterion fails.",
