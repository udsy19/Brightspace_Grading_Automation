  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Python model and generated outputs (implementation quotes) and describes a validation step that prints and checks NPV/IRR/PI/payback (validation quote). They also tie the numeric assumptions to the computed results (represent quote), demonstrating coherent logic and verification — meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly starts with the D-stage, states the problem, objectives, and decision rule, and then documents that assumptions were mapped \"before writing a single line of logic.\" Modeling is described only after that, satisfying the requirement that Define/Discover be completed and recorded prior to implementation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented the models, metrics, assumptions, and scenarios before coding and then implemented them (year-by-year table, tax/depreciation handling, custom IRR, scenario analysis). This clear plan-to-implementation linkage satisfies the criterion under the moderate DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of the capital structure trade-off (tax shield benefits vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor any quantification thereof, and it does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Discussion of taxes is limited to project-level depreciation and NOPAT, not debt-related tax shields. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: There is no discussion of who gains or loses under different financing or risk choices, no treatment of divergent incentives among stakeholders, and no mention of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The submission focuses on capital budgeting mechanics (NPV/IRR, sensitivity to revenue and WACC) without engaging the agency-conflict criterion, which is required even at a conceptual level under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - No discussion or math on DFL, ROE/EPS volatility under different capital structures, or downside/default risk and coverage ratios. Sensitivity to WACC is not a substitute for leverage analysis. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
