  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV construction: modeling year-0 outflow, annual operating cash flows, working capital timing, terminal value, and discounting all cash flows at WACC to sum to NPV. They also apply NPV in sensitivity analyses (revenue and WACC), demonstrating robust conceptual mastery beyond a surface mention. Although no numeric NPV is shown, the methodology and application across DRIVER stages meet a thorough, comprehensive standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly articulates the NPV accept/reject rule, ties it to the project’s hurdle rate, and demonstrates its application by computing NPV and interpreting positive values as value creation. They extend this to scenario analysis, indicating how decisions might change under different assumptions. Despite not showing the numeric NPV, the conceptual treatment and application are thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero and described implementing it via a custom bisection method, demonstrating solid conceptual and computational understanding. They validated and applied the IRR in decision-making, meeting the criterion with sufficient depth for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both simple and discounted payback and ties them to interpretation, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, no actual payback time values or detailed calculation steps are provided, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, this meets a correct but incomplete standard appropriate for PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes PI in the analysis and demonstrates related components (PV discounting and initial investment), indicating a basic understanding. However, they do not explain the PI formula or show how PV of benefits is divided by the initial investment, nor provide any calculation detail or result, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly includes both working capital recovery and a terminal value and integrates them into the model, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: there’s no discussion of after-tax salvage/recapture, disposal costs, or how terminal value is derived, so depth is insufficient for a PASS under this criterion.",
