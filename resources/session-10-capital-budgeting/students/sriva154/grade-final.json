  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, accurate NPV treatment: they account for the initial outflow (including working capital), discount cash flows at WACC, compute NPV, and validate with decision rules and sensitivity analysis. Multiple DRIVER stages reinforce conceptual correctness and application, meeting the moderate standard for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulated the NPV decision rule and applied it to the base case, then reinforced it through validation (NPV>0 aligns with IRR>WACC and PI>1) and sensitivity discussion. This shows thorough, accurate conceptual understanding and application across DRIVER stages, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer’s expectations.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly built automated sensitivity tests, ran them, and reported specific scenarios and outcomes (revenue shocks, WACC variation, cost increases) with validated impacts on NPV/IRR, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of sensitivity analysis on key assumptions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows correct conceptual understanding that IRR relates to the NPV curve’s zero-crossing and that IRR exceeds WACC, and they implemented code to compute it. However, they do not provide the actual IRR value or explicitly state it as “the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero,” so the treatment is correct but basic, not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly incorporated both simple and discounted payback and concluded they occur within project life, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not determine or report the specific time required to recover the investment or show the calculation, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Thus, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and interpreted the profitability index and stated the result (PI > 1), demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not present the PI formula or show the PV of benefits relative to initial investment with numbers, so treatment is basic rather than thorough, meeting PARTIAL under the moderate standard.",

      "driver_alignment": "Define (clear decision rule and problem framing), Discover (documented assumptions and inputs), Represent (structured the model before coding), Implement/Validate (implemented code and internal checks), Reflect (explicit learning and rationale) — together these stages show consistent application of the DRIVER framework and clear communication of methods and results.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly followed and documented DRIVER stages with specific assumptions, a defined decision rule, a planned model structure, implementation outcomes, validation checks, sensitivity tests, and reflection. This is thorough, specific, and demonstrates strong communication and explanation consistent with PASS standards."
