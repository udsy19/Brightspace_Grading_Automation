  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC +/-2% and up to 10.5%, a 50% revenue stress case), used visual NPV vs WACC analysis, and explicitly noted when NPV approaches break-even or turns negative. This demonstrates thorough, applied scenario analysis and highlights the decision-relevant breakpoints, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the code was run and outputs shown, and provides concrete validation checks (depreciation sum, working capital recovery, NPV/IRR consistency) that link assumptions to results. This is a thorough, coherent verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built sensitivity testing into the model (parameterized assumptions, reusable functions) and executed multiple scenario analyses on key drivers (revenue, WACC, operating costs), explaining impacts on NPV/IRR and project robustness. While tax rate wasn’t varied, the breadth and interpretation of FCF variability and discount rate stresses meet the criterion at a thorough level under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks project-level capital budgeting and never analyzes the capital structure trade-off (tax shields vs. distress/flexibility) across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. While DRIVER is used, it is not used for the required criterion, so the requirement is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on capital budgeting metrics and sensitivity, with no discussion of shareholder vs bondholder/management/employee/large-holder incentives, who gains/loses under financing/strategy options, or asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. Given the complete absence of stakeholder agency analysis across DRIVER stages, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses financial leverage or DFL, nor how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the absence of leverage analysis despite a thorough capital budgeting model, the criterion is not met.",
