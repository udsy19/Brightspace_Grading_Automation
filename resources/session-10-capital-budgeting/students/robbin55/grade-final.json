  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student follows a structured, end-to-end evaluation: they define the decision, map cash flows, build an after-tax model with depreciation, and compute NPV/IRR, while also noting assumption testing and financing options. This demonstrates a comprehensive, systematic framework appropriate for a moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the investment problem (Starbucks roastery, $12M initial outlay) and listed decision criteria (10-year horizon, 8.5% WACC, cashflow mapping, depreciation, working capital). They also described creating a financial timeline and building the model to compute NPV, satisfying the strict requirement for explicit Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described creating a cashflow timeline/graph and building a model, and provided concrete calculations (depreciation, after-tax cashflows) and an NPV result. These clear, specific artifacts satisfy the strict requirement for an explicit, quality framework for projecting cash flows and evaluating the investment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states an NPV at the stated discount rate and references building an after-tax cash flow model including initial investment and working capital, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide a thorough explanation of the NPV calculation steps (discounting detailed cash flows and explicitly netting against the initial outlay), so coverage is basic rather than comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated a positive NPV and recommended proceeding, indicating a basic grasp of accept/reject logic. However, they did not explicitly state the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) or tie their decision to the positive NPV; the justification relied on “how much we will make a year,” leaving gaps for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR-like figure (10.15%) and discussed NPV at the WACC, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, provided no methodological detail, and repeatedly misnamed it as “initial” rate of return. This meets a basic conceptual bar but lacks the depth needed for a PASS.",
