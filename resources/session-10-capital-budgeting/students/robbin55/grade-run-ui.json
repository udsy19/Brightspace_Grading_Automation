  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly records defining the core decision and capturing initial investment parameters up front, then creating a cashflow map before building the model. This clear sequence satisfies the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated a pre-implementation plan (timeline/graph and listed data inputs) and then linked that plan to implemented artifacts (built model, computed cashflows, NPV). The representation is clear though high-level, and the implementation follows the stated plan, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a clear, systematic execution: construction of a model, explicit intermediate calculation (depreciation), and reported validated outputs (NPV and return) tied back to assumptions. These elements satisfy the moderate IMPLEMENT standard for demonstrating a traceable methodological implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off criterion: there is no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs for buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction, nor any linkage to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Instead, the work centers on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR with depreciation and generic financing comments, which is off-scope for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and does not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. Mentioning loans lacks any linkage to agency conflicts or bondholder-shareholder tensions. Under the moderate standard, at least a conceptual discussion is required, which is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission mentions using debt but provides no leverage math (DFL, EPS/ROE effects) and no discussion of volatility, downside risk, bankruptcy probability, or coverage ratios. Given only cash flow/NPV focus and a debt recommendation without risk analysis, it does not meet the criterion even under moderate strictness.",
