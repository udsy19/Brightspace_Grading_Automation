  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the code and observing outputs, and provides specific validation checks (ICF, depreciation = $1.2M, WACC = 8.5%, terminal/working-capital treatment) that align with the model logic. These detailed, concrete checks across REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT/VALIDATE demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the goal and project parameters at the start (\"to start off this assignment...\") and then describes model representation and implementation afterward, demonstrating the Discover stage was completed and documented prior to modeling. No evidence of a post-hoc D-stage appears.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined objectives and detailed project parameters before modeling, specified the components and scenarios to represent, and then described how the code implemented those plans (parameters → cash flows → metrics/sensitivity). This shows a systematic plan and clear linkage from representation to implementation across the Discover, Represent, and Implement stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs (tax shields from debt vs. distress/flexibility costs) across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, nor quantify these elements or connect them to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. References to “tax shield” concern depreciation within a project model, not debt-related tax benefits. Therefore, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under alternatives, or why incentives diverge. It also lacks any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. While DRIVER stages are evident for project evaluation, the specific criterion is missing; thus, FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, provides no DFL/ROE/EPS math, and omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Focus remained on project cash flows and WACC-based capital budgeting, not leverage effects, which is required for this criterion.",
