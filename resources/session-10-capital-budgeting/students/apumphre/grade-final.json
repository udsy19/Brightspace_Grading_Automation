  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and described their code, provided block-by-block explanation of what each part does, and documented validation steps confirming correct cash-flow construction and application of the 8.5% hurdle for NPV/IRR. Those explicit implementation and validation statements satisfy the strict requirements for demonstrating correct NPV and IRR calculations.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly demonstrated representation, implementation, and validation of cash flow projections (ran code, showed yearly ICF/DCFs, and verified depreciation, working capital treatment, terminal value, and WACC). This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level understanding of what the code does, and ownership of validation, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the depreciation method and amount, the corporate tax rate, and that they ran and validated the model outputs including depreciation, tax shields, and working-capital tax effects. These concrete, self-reported checks across Implement and Validate meet the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described discounting cash flows (DCF), applying the 8.5% WACC, and including year-0 outflows, demonstrating a sound conceptual grasp of NPV. However, they did not show the explicit NPV calculation or any numeric NPV result, leaving the treatment short of thorough. Under moderate strictness, this merits a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows they used NPV with the 8.5% hurdle rate and evaluated accept/reject, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly state the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) or present the NPV result, limiting depth. Thus, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and discussed IRR, compared it to WACC, and articulated a key property (intrinsic to cash flows). However, they did not explicitly describe or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero nor provide the computed IRR value, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.",
