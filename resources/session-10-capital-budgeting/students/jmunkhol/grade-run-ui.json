  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed the required base and multiple sensitivity scenarios, reported numeric impacts on NPV/IRR, and explicitly identified the breakpoint (a 20% revenue shortfall flips NPV negative) that changes the accept/reject decision. This demonstrates thorough, actionable sensitivity analysis and alignment with DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code, presents resulting cash flows and metrics, and describes validation steps and how core assumptions (depreciation, working capital, terminal liquidation) produce the observed output. This demonstrates a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student verbally walks through the cash flow table, highlighting specific values, timing, and reasons for peaks/spikes, and then explains the sensitivity scenarios with units (millions, percentages) and their implications for capital allocation decisions. This clear narration of visual outputs and scenario context meets the criterion with sufficient depth for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure choices, tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility trade-offs, or buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Any mention of taxes is limited to project-level cash flow and depreciation effects, not capital structure. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and it omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage/buybacks. It focuses on NPV/IRR, sensitivity to revenue/WACC, and brand risks without stakeholder agency analysis, which is required for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. There is no discussion of debt vs equity, interest coverage, bankruptcy risk, or leverage math; the risk discussion is about operating leverage and revenue sensitivity only. Under the moderate standard, conceptual coverage would suffice, but it is missing here, so this criterion fails.",
