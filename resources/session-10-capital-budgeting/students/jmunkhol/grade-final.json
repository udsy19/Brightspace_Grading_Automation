  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided a full cash flow schedule (including depreciation, taxes, working capital, and terminal value) and computed NPV at the stated 8.5% WACC with a clear accept/reject interpretation, plus sensitivity analyses. Despite a minor formula phrasing and a typographical slip on the Year 0 figure, the implementation and results are accurate and thorough, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied grasp of NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and correctly articulated the NPV decision rule and applied it to the base case and sensitivity scenarios, using results to justify accept/reject implications. The treatment is thorough enough for a moderate standard, connecting rule, computation, and decision across multiple cases.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented and ran sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numeric impacts on NPV/IRR, and described the code structure and validation steps. They demonstrated personal execution, described key code blocks (cash-flow loop, tax/depreciation handling), and carried out verification—meeting the strict requirements for technical implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero and states they computed it via bisection, providing an IRR figure and using it in the decision. However, results are inconsistent (12.84% vs 13.5%) and there’s limited depth (no IRR scenario results or detailed verification), so the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a simple payback period (5.28 years) and showed conceptual understanding by modeling cash flows, but provided only the result with minimal explanation and did not present the discounted payback period requested. Given the basic treatment and missing depth, this meets a correct-but-incomplete standard rather than a thorough one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a profitability index (1.22), indicating they calculated it in the implementation. However, they did not explain the PI concept (present value of benefits divided by initial investment), show how it was computed, or discuss its decision rule, while they did provide explanations for other metrics.

      "reasoning": "The student correctly included and parameterized the stated capex and ran validation checks (depreciation, working capital), showing awareness of assumption management—hence not a fail. However, they did not document or justify the real estate/construction cost (the $12M) with breakdowns, sources, contingencies, or explicit rationale, nor perform sensitivity around capex, so the treatment is correct but incomplete for a thorough PASS."
