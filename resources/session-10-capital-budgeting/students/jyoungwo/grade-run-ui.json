  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (WACC shifts and a 20% revenue shock), reported specific NPVs/IRRs for those cases, and identified a clear breakpoint where a 20% revenue drop flips the decision from accept to reject. They also tied this to conditional recommendations and mitigations, demonstrating thorough, applied sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code and provides multiple validation checks (depreciation arithmetic, terminal/working‑capital reconciliation, and NPV/IRR agreement) that demonstrate the outputs were compared against expectations. These concrete verbal verifications across Implement and Validate stages meet the moderate standard for a thorough confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what the charts show, using specific units (millions of dollars, years, percentages) and values, and ties them to decision trade-offs (accept/reject under different scenarios). Multiple scenarios are verbally explained with corresponding visual cues and metrics, satisfying a comprehensive, in-depth treatment under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the specified criterion: it neither quantifies interest tax shield benefits versus expected distress/optionality costs for capital return alternatives nor links any trade-off to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Mention of a depreciation tax shield within a project cash flow is unrelated to capital structure choices. Therefore, despite use of the DRIVER framework, the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - There is no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts (shareholders vs bondholders vs management/employees/large holders), who gains/loses under financing/operating choices, or of asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The submission focuses solely on project cash flows and revenue sensitivity, leaving the criterion unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, provides no DFL calculations, and omits discussion of bankruptcy risk or interest coverage/DSCR under different debt policies. Sensitivity to WACC and revenue is covered, but leverage-specific analysis is missing, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
