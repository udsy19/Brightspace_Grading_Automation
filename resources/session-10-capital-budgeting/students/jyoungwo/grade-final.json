  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by stating the base-case NPV with acceptance logic, explicitly accounting for the initial outlay, working capital timing, and terminal value, and explaining discounting impacts in sensitivity. Implementation, validation, and reflective scenario analysis together show thorough and accurate application beyond a surface mention, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) and applies it thoroughly to base and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating correct accept and reject decisions. The discussion is integrated across DRIVER stages, showing a strong conceptual grasp and practical application sufficient for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, computes a base-case IRR (13.25%), and uses it against the hurdle rate. They further apply IRR in sensitivity scenarios, accurately noting its independence from WACC and how revenue shocks reduce IRR below the hurdle. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and interpreted the discounted payback period (8.21 years) and linked it to recovering the $12.5M initial investment, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief with no calculation detail, cumulative (discounted) cash flow crossover demonstration, or sensitivity/contrast with simple payback, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows conceptual understanding by incorporating operating cash flows, initial capital expenditures, and working capital changes in the schedule (year 0 outflow and year 10 recovery). However, their free cash flow formula is unclear and omits explicit treatment of CapEx beyond t0, and the OCF description is imprecise. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the main incremental project cash flows (initial capex, NWC outlay and recovery, operating cash flows, terminal value) and builds/validates an incremental schedule. However, the treatment lacks depth and precision: the OCF formula is misstated and there is no explicit discussion of excluding non-incremental items (e.g., financing costs, sunk costs/opportunity costs).

      "reasoning": "The student documents key cost figures and validates the model arithmetic, showing correct application of depreciation, working capital, and terminal value (Discover, Implement, Validate). However, they rely on textbook inputs without further documenting or justifying the real‑estate/construction cost assumptions (no breakdown, market/comparable support, contingencies, or rationale), so the treatment is correct but not thorough. Consequently, PARTIAL is appropriate."
