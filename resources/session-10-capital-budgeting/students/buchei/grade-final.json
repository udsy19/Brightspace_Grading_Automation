  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly calculated NPV using an 8.5% discount rate, referenced a comprehensive cash flow build (including depreciation, taxes, working capital, and terminal value), and reported the NPV result. Sensitivity analysis across revenue and WACC shows depth beyond basics. The Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages collectively demonstrate a thorough, accurate NPV treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the NPV decision rule by tying acceptance to a positive NPV at the firm’s WACC and recognizing that a negative NPV under adverse conditions would undermine acceptance. They reinforced understanding with multiple scenarios (base case and sensitivities) and a clear recommendation aligned with NPV outcomes, demonstrating thorough, accurate grasp.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated capital budgeting calculations by coding and executing the cash flow schedule and key metrics (NPV, IRR, payback, PI) and extended it with automated sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios. Multiple outputs and scenario runs demonstrate thorough application and integration of finance with technology, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, compared it to the hurdle rate, and discussed sensitivity, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail how it was computed, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly reports a payback period and references the cash flow path and working capital recovery, demonstrating basic understanding. However, there’s no explanation of the method, no distinction between simple vs discounted payback, and no discussion of how 5.28 years is derived. This is correct but not thorough, so it merits a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student acknowledges PI, ties it to WACC-based discounting, and interprets a positive PI, showing correct conceptual understanding. However, they neither present the PI value nor explain its calculation as PV of benefits divided by initial investment, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",
