  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base-case NPV/IRR and ran multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC variations) with numeric results. They explicitly identified the breakpoint (20% revenue drop) that flips NPV negative and reduces IRR below the hurdle, demonstrating the required scenario/sensitivity analysis and stakeholder-impact insight.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms executing the code and reports specific numeric outputs (NPV, IRR, payback). They then validate those outputs against the 8.5% hurdle and sensitivity tests (revenue drop/WACC), tying results back to stated assumptions—meeting the criterion with thorough verbal confirmation and interpretation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built and executed a sensitivity analysis on key value drivers (revenue and WACC), provided specific quantitative impacts on NPV and IRR, and clearly explained how these shifts affect the project’s risk profile (fragility to revenue declines, resilience to higher WACC). This meets the moderate standard with sufficient depth and application to merit a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress/flexibility costs, or comparison across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor any connection to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The work focuses on Starbucks project NPV/IRR and sensitivity, which does not satisfy the specified capital structure criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Content is limited to project valuation and sensitivity, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission analyzes project viability and sensitivity to revenue and WACC but does not address financial leverage effects or DFL, nor how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. It also omits any bankruptcy risk or interest/coverage metrics. Given the criterion’s focus, this is missing core content, resulting in a fail.",
