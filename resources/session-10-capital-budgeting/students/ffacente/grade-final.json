  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly sets the discount rate (8.5%), models full free cash flows including initial outlay and terminal value, and explicitly discounts cash flows to year zero using a financial library, then reports and interprets NPV. They further apply NPV in validation and sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding beyond a basic mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV>0 at the firm’s WACC and recognizes that negative NPV implies value destruction. They provide specific figures and sensitivity analysis, linking decisions to NPV across scenarios and aligning them with DRIVER stages, demonstrating a thorough, accurate understanding.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described block‑by‑block cash‑flow calculations (EBIT, taxes, addback depreciation, capex, working capital, terminal value), implemented and ran the code, and validated outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) including sensitivity tests. This meets the strict requirements for personal execution, ownership, and clear technical understanding, so the criterion is passed.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and used IRR appropriately in decision-making, indicating basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and reported inconsistent IRR values (12.84% vs 13.5%), indicating gaps in accuracy and thoroughness. This supports a Partial rather than a Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets the discounted payback period, showing conceptual understanding of time to recover invested capital. However, they provide only a brief result with no methodological detail (e.g., cumulative discounted cash flow timeline or sensitivity to assumptions), so the treatment is accurate but not thorough. Hence, PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never defines or calculates the profitability index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While discounting and other metrics are shown, there is no conceptual discussion or computation of PI, which is required for this criterion even under moderate strictness. Therefore, this criterion is not met.",
