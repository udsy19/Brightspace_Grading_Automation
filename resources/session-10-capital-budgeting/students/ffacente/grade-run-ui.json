  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities, reported quantitative outcomes (NPV/IRR) for each, and identified the key breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts (revenue -20% flips NPV negative while cost-of-capital ±2% does not). Coverage is specific, actionable, and tied to DRIVER stages, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the analysis function and inspected console output, and they clearly describe the key assumptions and cash-flow logic that produce the reported metrics. They also report specific validation results (e.g., MPV/IRR in the transcript) and ran sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the visuals show (cash flow bars, NPV scenario bars) and interprets results with units and scenarios (dollars, percentages, years), directly addressing capital allocation trade-offs and shareholder value impact. Coverage spans base-case outputs and sensitivity charts, meeting the moderate standard with thorough, specific descriptions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission contains no analysis of buyback/dividend/debt reduction options, no quantification of tax advantages vs. expected distress/optionality costs, and no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. It is a project evaluation for a Starbucks store, not a capital structure trade-off discussion. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission provides no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. The work stays strictly within project cash flows and sensitivity analysis, so it does not meet the criterion’s required conceptual coverage.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity changes EPS/ROE volatility. No treatment of downside/bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios; only WACC sensitivity is shown. Thus, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
