You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, thorough grasp of NPV by constructing free cash flows over the horizon, explicitly including the initial outlay, discounting via a proper financial library, and correctly handling terminal value and taxes. They present concrete results and sensitivity analysis, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applies the NPV decision rule, showing acceptance when NPV is positive and identifying failure when NPV turns negative under a sales decline. They support this with base-case and sensitivity scenarios and explicitly implement NPV calculations, demonstrating thorough and correct understanding.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described block-by-block logic for cash-flow construction, used numpy_financial for NPV/IRR, executed the code (console output), and reported numeric results and sensitivity checks. This demonstrates personal execution, understanding of the functions, and ownership—meeting the strict Technical Implementation standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported IRR using an appropriate method and interpreted it against a hurdle rate, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or provide deeper exploration or examples, so coverage is adequate but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly computed and reported a simple payback and described an appropriate method to find the exact crossover, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: no discounted payback, no sensitivity or comparative discussion of payback, and limited elaboration beyond the single result, so it falls short of a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never calculates or discusses the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). They focus on NPV, IRR, and payback across Implement and Reflect, with no mention of PI or its formula. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is absent, so this criterion fails.",
