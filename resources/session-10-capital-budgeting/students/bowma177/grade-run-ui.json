  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented base-case plus multiple sensitivities (WACC range and a 20% revenue drop), reported numeric outcomes, and explicitly identified the breakpoint where stakeholder preference should change (revenue shortfall causes project failure). This is a thorough, well-supported sensitivity analysis consistent with the DRIVER stages, meriting a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports executing the code (\"base case output in the console\") and describes sensitivity tests (revenue shock and discount-rate range), satisfying the run-and-validate requirement. They also verbally explain key assumptions (terminal sale taxation, depreciation, cash-flow construction) and link those to reported results (NPV/IRR/payback), demonstrating a thorough, consistent treatment across REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the visual/console outputs show (base case cash flows, NPV, IRR, payback) and explains scenarios with units (millions, percent, years). They also verbally interpret sensitivity chart results across WACC and revenue scenarios, offering multiple concrete examples. This meets a thorough, conceptually solid description suitable for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, provides no quantification of tax shields or expected distress/optionality costs, and makes no connection to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. All DRIVER stages center on a Starbucks project DCF, not the required Apple capital structure analysis. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor why their incentives diverge. It also does not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics connected to leverage or buybacks. All DRIVER stages concentrate on modeling and operating sensitivity, not agency conflicts.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage and discount rate sensitivity but does not address financial leverage effects, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion of financial leverage is still required; none is provided, so the criterion is not met.",
