You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly operationalizes NPV as discounted future cash flows minus the initial investment and demonstrates it via a coded implementation with clear parameters. They extend the analysis with validation and sensitivity (different WACCs, higher cash flows), showing thorough understanding beyond basics, aligned with multiple DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented and ran sensitivity checks on the key assumptions (discount rate and cash-flow magnitude), described the compute_npv function block-by-block, and reported printed results—meeting the strict requirement for personal execution, understanding, and ownership.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated capital budgeting calculations by coding a reusable NPV function and extending it to run sensitivity and scenario analyses, showing depth beyond a single calculation. Their Implement, Validate, and Evolve steps explicitly integrate finance logic with Python, meeting the criterion thoroughly under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) and ties it to value creation, with sensitivity checks to WACC. However, treatment is basic: no explicit final decision, no discussion of the zero-NPV indifference case or broader decision contexts. Hence, solid but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses entirely on NPV and WACC-based sensitivity, with no computation, description, or approximation of IRR. Given the criterion specifically requires computing the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, the absence of any IRR treatment results in a fail despite sound NPV analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the Payback Period concept or compute the time to recover the initial $50,000 investment. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided; all analysis centers on NPV and WACC sensitivity. Therefore, this criterion fails.",
