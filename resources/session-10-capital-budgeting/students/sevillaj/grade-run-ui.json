  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Python script in Colab, printed the base-case NPV, and re-ran the calculation for multiple WACC scenarios and a +10% cash-flow case, demonstrating active validation of outputs. Their verbal explanation of assumptions and the observed sensitivity (NPV falls as WACC rises; increases with higher cash flows) aligns with the results, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly defines the problem, stakeholders (BrightScooters), objectives (assess NPV at 8% WACC) before describing representation and coding steps. Because the D-stage is documented up front and precedes the modeling, the criterion is fully satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly mapped the representation (timeline, inputs, WACC, NPV metric) before coding and then implemented those elements with a compute_npv function in Colab. They also planned and executed scenario analyses (multiple WACCs and a +10% cash-flow case), demonstrating linkage from plan to implemented artifacts.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shields, financial distress/flexibility costs, or alternatives across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, and it does not reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk. The focus is solely on a toy NPV example for BrightScooters. Given the absence of the required capital structure analysis, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No content identifies gains/losses or incentive divergence among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and there is no discussion of leverage, buybacks, asset substitution, or risk-shifting. The analysis is limited to capital budgeting mechanics, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/WACC sensitivity and implementation in Python, with no treatment of how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, nor any mention of DFL or coverage/bankruptcy considerations. Given the criterion requires leverage effects and risk implications, even at a conceptual level, this omission results in a FAIL.",
