  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented sensitivity tests (parallel 100 bp rate shock and spread widening), described the methodology (modified-duration first-order approximation), ran the code and reported numeric outcomes. This meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of sensitivity analysis on key assumptions.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a structured, end-to-end evaluation framework: clear objectives, an optimization-based construction with explicit constraints, quantified stress tests, and discussion of trade-offs and next steps. The depth (specific targets, constraints, metrics, and scenario results) demonstrates a thorough and systematic approach suitable for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the investment problem and the decision criteria (objective function and hard constraints), describes the planned workflow, and indicates they ran the implementation to produce results. These explicit statements satisfy the strict DRIVER requirement for Define & Discover.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not calculate or explicitly discuss NPV (present value of future cash flows minus initial investment). While PV and duration effects are mentioned conceptually, there is no NPV methodology, examples, or results. Under moderate strictness, this remains insufficient for the NPV criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not mention NPV, define it, or apply the accept/reject decision rule, nor provide any example of NPV-based project evaluation. Given the moderate standard allows conceptual discussion, the complete absence of NPV content leads to a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never defines or computes IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor connects YTM to an IRR/NPV framework. All technical work centers on yield, duration matching, and stress testing, with no IRR methodology or example provided. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion.",
