  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports executing the code in Colab and provides concrete validation checks (specific Year 0 FCF and expected cash‑flow shape) that align with their stated assumptions and calculation logic. These clear, example-based confirmations demonstrate valid code execution and reasonable matching between assumptions and results, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly shows a documented Discover stage with problem, stakeholders/objectives, and detailed assumptions, and it states a pre-coding outline was created before implementation. This satisfies the requirement that Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to modeling, so the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a detailed pre-coding plan (models, metrics, scenarios) and then stated they implemented that plan in Python, with validation showing expected Year 0 cash flow—demonstrating clear linkage from representation to implemented artifacts. This meets the moderate-standard requirement for systematic methodology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss or quantify tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. It focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and sensitivity to WACC, which does not meet the specified criterion. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. It also lacks any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. Despite solid DRIVER execution on valuation, the criterion is missing; thus, FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission treats financing only via WACC sensitivity and never addresses leverage math (DFL), EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the criterion requires discussing how financing choice changes ROE/EPS volatility and risk, the absence of any leverage or coverage analysis results in a fail despite the solid capital budgeting work.",
