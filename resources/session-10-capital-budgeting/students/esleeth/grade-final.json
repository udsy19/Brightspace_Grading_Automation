  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the NPV process: building free cash flows, including working capital and terminal value, discounting at the WACC, and recognizing the initial outlay in Year 0. They implemented the calculation and validated key elements, then analyzed NPV sensitivity, demonstrating thorough conceptual mastery consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusted for capital expenditures and working capital changes, outlining the steps (NOPAT + depreciation, then WC and capex) and implementing them in a model. They also validate with a concrete check (Year 0 FCF = –$12.5M from capex + NWC), satisfying the criterion with thorough, specific evidence.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly specified straight-line depreciation and a 25% tax rate and described the stepwise treatment (EBIT → taxes → NOPAT → add back depreciation) before implementing. They built and ran the model in Python and validated outputs, demonstrating personal execution and correct conceptual handling of depreciation and taxes.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies the NPV decision rule by recommending acceptance when NPV is positive and confirms robustness via sensitivity. However, they do not explicitly articulate the rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if < 0) or discuss edge cases, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes IRR, reports results relative to the hurdle rate, and examines sensitivity, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes payback and notes the model calculates both payback and discounted payback, offering a qualitative conclusion that payback occurs well before Year 10. However, they provide no numeric payback period, method explanation, or sensitivity/interpretation beyond the brief statement. Under moderate standards this shows correct but basic understanding, warranting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.",

However, they do not justify or externally validate the key real estate/construction cost inputs (e.g., the $12M capex, rent level, or terminal value) with benchmarks, sources, or rationale, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
