  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined NPV and applied it by constructing cash flows including the initial outlay, discounting at WACC, and interpreting NPV for decision-making. Multiple scenario analyses (base, revenue drop, WACC changes) and clear acceptance rules show thorough, correct treatment consistent with a strong grasp of NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the NPV decision rule and applies it correctly to multiple scenarios (base, -20% revenue), demonstrating depth beyond a surface mention. The DRIVER stages show conceptual setup, implementation with results, and reflective decision-making aligned to NPV, satisfying a thorough treatment for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately computed and interpreted both simple and discounted payback, explained why discounted payback is longer (TVM), and contextualized the result against the project’s 10-year life. Evidence across Discover, Implement, and Reflect shows thorough, conceptually sound treatment beyond a surface mention, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero and applies it correctly in base and downside scenarios, comparing to WACC to drive decisions. However, the treatment is brief and lacks deeper methodological explanation or exploration beyond basic usage, so it demonstrates correct but basic understanding consistent with PARTIAL under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines PI as PV of cash flows relative to upfront cost and provides a computed value with clear interpretation, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: no explicit formula application is shown and PI isn’t extended to sensitivity scenarios, limiting depth. Under moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies the components (OCF, CapEx, working capital) and produces an FCF timeline, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly apply the FCF formula (OCF minus CapEx minus changes in working capital) and at one point equate OCF and FCF despite noting a working capital outflow, suggesting incomplete or possibly inaccurate application.
