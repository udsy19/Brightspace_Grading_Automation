  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran the required base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numeric outcomes (NPV +$3M base; NPV -$2M at -20% revenue) and clearly identified the decision breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts (accept → reject). The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate/Evolve) support a thorough, applied sensitivity analysis, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Colab code, reports specific outputs (NPV, IRR, payback, PI), and verbally compares those outputs to their hand-calculated expectations, noting agreement. The Represent→Implement→Validate progression provides clear evidence of running and validating the code and that the logic and assumptions match the stated results, meeting the criterion for a thorough verbal confirmation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the charts show (timeline losses and recoveries, inverse NPV–WACC relationship) and states units and scenarios (dollars, percentages, base vs −20% revenue, ±2% WACC). Multiple visuals are verbally interpreted and linked to capital allocation decisions (accept/reject, shareholder value), meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off criterion. It neither quantifies tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction options nor connects conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The work focuses on a Starbucks project evaluation (NPV/IRR/WACC sensitivity) with no capital structure analysis, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor who gains/loses under different financing or policy choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Aside from a brief nod to “shareholder value,” there is no stakeholder or agency analysis, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, provide DFL math, or discuss bankruptcy/coverage metrics. The work focuses on project valuation and WACC sensitivity, not leverage mechanics or downside risk from debt. Despite clear DRIVER structure, the criterion is missing; therefore, FAIL.",
