  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports executing code, iterating on it (\"tweak the code\"), and performing manual verification of key outputs (NPV/MPV and taxes) that matched the code. Those Implement and Validate statements show a clear, correct verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the problem statement, benchmark facts, and hurdle rate at the start (Discover) and then clearly states the planned modeling approach (Represent) before describing implementation, meeting the requirement that Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a prior plan of models, scenarios, and metrics (Represent) and then implemented that plan in code, produced the incremental cash flows and core metrics, and ran sensitivity tests (Implement/Validate/Evolve). This demonstrates a systematic linkage from plan to implemented artifacts, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, tax shield benefits of debt, or financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it tie any analysis to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. References to “tax shields” are limited to depreciation within a Starbucks project NPV, which is unrelated to the specified criterion. Despite DRIVER elements being present, they are misaligned with this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no identification of who gains/loses across stakeholders and no discussion of incentive divergence. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite adequate DRIVER process on valuation mechanics, the specific criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address leverage math (DFL/ROE/EPS), volatility implications, stakeholder preferences, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. It remains at project NPV/IRR analysis without capital structure considerations. Therefore, it fails this criterion.",
