  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the project scope, all key numeric inputs, and the decision criterion (8.5% WACC), and described a concrete representation (incremental cash-flow schedule) to evaluate NPV/IRR. This meets the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic implementation: an organized cash‑flow model, computed NPV/IRR/payback/profitability index, manual validation, and multiple sensitivity scenarios. Minor inconsistent verbal claims about scenario outcomes do not undermine that the methodological execution and sensitivity analysis were performed, meeting the moderate DRIVER standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly ran and reported sensitivity analyses (Evolve) and tied results to a recommendation that balances financial metrics, strategic fit, brand considerations, and risk. They also demonstrated implementation and validation of the model, providing clear, actionable evidence that capital budgeting outputs were used to inform corporate decisions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual grasp of NPV, identifies the discount rate, builds incremental cash flows, computes NPV, and claims validation via the formula. However, details are sparse and there is a notable inconsistency in sensitivity results (NPV negative vs. “remains positive” under a 20% revenue drop), which weakens accuracy and thoroughness. This supports a correct-but-basic treatment, not a comprehensive one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV>0, reject if NPV<0) and applies it in multiple scenarios, showing conceptual understanding. However, contradictory statements (e.g., claiming both negative and positive NPV under the same sensitivity and rejecting despite a positive base-case NPV) indicate gaps and inconsistency, preventing a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student neither computes nor states an IRR value and shows a misconception by implying IRR is calculated “using the WACC,” rather than as the discount rate that makes NPV zero. References to IRR are only qualitative (“goes down”) without definition, method, or results, failing to demonstrate even basic conceptual accuracy for this criterion.",
