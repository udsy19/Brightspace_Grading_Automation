  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applies NPV by discounting cash flows at 8.5%, incorporates initial outlay (including working capital) and terminal value, and reports a computed NPV corroborated via an external calculator. Multiple scenarios demonstrate robust application and understanding across DRIVER stages, meeting thoroughness for a PASS despite minor typos.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines the NPV decision rule, applies it to the base case, and consistently uses it in multiple sensitivity scenarios to accept or reject. Coverage is thorough across DRIVER stages, showing strong conceptual grasp and application of the accept-if-NPV>0, reject-if-NPV<0 rule.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated core capital budgeting calculations (NPV, IRR, paybacks, PI) via code, produced the PV schedule, and extended automation to scenario analysis, demonstrating depth beyond basic calculation. Validation against an external calculator and multiple scenario runs show comprehensive and accurate use of technology across Represent, Implement, and Evolve stages, meeting a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR (e.g., 13.25% base case; 3.19% under a 20% revenue drop) and compares it to the hurdle rate across scenarios, showing sound conceptual use. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate/verify that condition, nor provide a thorough method for how IRR was computed. This reflects correct but basic treatment, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and reports both simple and discounted payback periods and briefly interprets the discounted payback against the project horizon, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, there is no detailed explanation of the calculation method (e.g., cumulative cash flows), no walk-through, and no deeper analysis or sensitivity specific to payback, so coverage is accurate but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes and computes the profitability index and references PV calculations, indicating basic understanding. However, they do not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment, show the actual formula or components, or discuss interpretation beyond reporting a single value. This meets a correct but basic treatment, not a thorough one.",

      "reasoning": "The student applies the company's WACC and computes project returns and sensitivities (Discover/Implement/Evolve), but nowhere compares these results to industry benchmark returns for retail locations or cites comparable retail benchmarks. Because the assignment criterion specifically requires industry benchmark comparison and that analysis is missing, the submission fails this criterion."

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents key cost assumptions (initial investment, working capital, rent, COGS, etc.) and demonstrates model validation for calculations. However, they do not justify or validate the real estate/construction cost assumptions themselves (e.g., source or rationale for the $12M, $8M rent/utilities), relying instead on treating them as fixed inputs.
