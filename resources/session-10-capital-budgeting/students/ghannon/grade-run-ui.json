  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC ±2%), reported quantitative outcomes, and explicitly identified that a 20% revenue drop flips the recommendation (accept → reject). This meets the criterion with clear scenario analysis and highlighted the breakpoint where stakeholder preference changes.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the model in Colab, reports computed metrics, and describes using an external NPV calculator that matched the code output. They also clearly articulate key assumptions and link them to results (base case and sensitivity scenarios), satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, objectives, constraints, data inventory, and success measures during the Define/Discover discussion and notes that the D-stage was performed prior to the Represent/Implement modeling. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit, up-front D-stage, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress/optionality costs, or payout/debt choices, and it does not reference Apple. Given the criterion requires analysis of capital structure trade-offs and Apple-specific linkage, the content is missing despite otherwise solid DRIVER execution on a different topic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses, or agency issues, and does not address asset substitution or risk-shifting related to leverage/buybacks. Given the complete absence of this content across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, it fails this criterion under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, degree of financial leverage, or downside/bankruptcy risk, nor does it discuss coverage metrics. It focuses solely on project evaluation metrics and WACC sensitivity, which does not meet this criterion’s requirements.",
