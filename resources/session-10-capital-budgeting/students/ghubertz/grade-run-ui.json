  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the model in Python/Colab and reports computed metrics (NPV, IRR, payback). They also describe the cash‑flow logic (depreciation, FCF formula) and performed sensitivity validation showing results align with assumptions, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states a Discover stage with the project definition, upfront assumptions, and objective (NPV at 8.5%) before moving into the Represent/modeling stage. Stakeholder focus on Starbucks/shareholders and key parameters are documented up front, meeting the strict requirement that D-stage be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified the modeling approach, required data and metrics before coding (Represent) and then implemented those artifacts in code with resulting NPV/IRR/payback and sensitivity analysis (Implement/Validate), demonstrating systematic linkage from plan to execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax shield benefits or expected distress/flexibility costs, or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices. It also does not connect any analysis to Apple’s balance sheet or risk. Despite using the DRIVER framework, the work focuses solely on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR assessment, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR, sensitivity, and revenue risk but does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. Given the complete absence of this content across DRIVER stages, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics or stakeholder risk preferences. It relies on WACC-based NPV/IRR and revenue sensitivity, leaving leverage effects unaddressed.",
