  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0), applies it by computing NPV at the hurdle rate, and makes an accept/reject decision based on that result. Validation via sensitivity further reinforces correct application, demonstrating thorough understanding sufficient for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly modeled multi-phase cash flows (distinct revenue phases, differing marketing costs, and explicit terminal/NWC recovery) and computed time-specific outputs (e.g., year-10 FCF). Implementation in Python plus sensitivity analysis indicates comprehensive treatment beyond a basic discussion, meeting the depth expected for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student applied a complete, methodical investment evaluation framework: structured setup, detailed FCF modeling, core metrics (NPV/IRR/payback), and sensitivity analysis, followed by risk-focused next steps. This depth across DRIVER stages demonstrates a strong, systematic approach that meets a thorough standard under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding of NPV, including discounting at WACC, FCF formulation, treatment of working capital and terminal value, and provides a computed NPV. However, the inconsistency between the stated $20M upfront outlay and the $12.5M used in the calculation undermines accuracy, preventing a thorough, error-free demonstration. Thus, this meets the criterion at a basic but not comprehensive level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and provides a computed value, then applies it against the hurdle rate, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the calculation mechanics or demonstrate NPV equals zero at the stated rate, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and computes the payback period and provides a fractional-year calculation, showing conceptual understanding and application (Implement stage). However, they do not present the annual cash flows supporting the 2.3/2.7 figures and there is inconsistency in the stated initial outlay ($20M vs $12.5M), limiting thoroughness.
