  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by constructing free cash flows (including working capital and after-tax salvage), discounting them at 8.5%, summing present values, and subtracting the initial outlay to arrive at ~$2.7M. They explained the PV formula, showed year-by-year discounting, and validated results via code and a calculator, plus explored sensitivity impacts on NPV. This depth and application across DRIVER stages meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV>0) and applies it to the base case to accept the project. They also evaluate a downside scenario where NPV becomes negative and infer rejection, demonstrating contextual understanding. Coverage across stages with calculation and application satisfies a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately determined the payback period using a cumulative cash flow schedule and the standard fractional-year method (5.28 years), and provided a clear explanation of the recovery point between years 5 and 6. Minor typos/inconsistencies aside, the concept and calculation are treated thoroughly and validated via implementation, satisfying a moderate standard for depth and accuracy.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed an IRR (12.84%) and provided a basic interpretation relative to the 8.5% WACC, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or demonstrate/verify NPV=0 at the IRR, and the explanation was brief with minor imprecision. Thus, coverage is correct but not thorough, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified salvage as taxable given zero book value and computed the after-tax salvage (2.25m), and correctly modeled full working capital recovery in year 10. However, they inconsistently added 2.5m (not 2.25m) as terminal value in the final FCF, indicating an application error. Conceptual understanding is evident but not thorough due to this inconsistency, hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates correct NPV numbers with explicit year-by-year PV calculations and reports an IRR (12.84%) produced by code, and they state they validated outputs. However, under the strict Technical Implementation standard they did not provide block-by-block explanation of the code or show detailed personal walkthrough of the implementation (only reporting outputs and claiming validation), so full PASS is not met.",

      "reasoning": "The submission presents detailed projected revenues and a rigorous discounted cash flow implementation, but never cites or uses comparable Starbucks store performance metrics to validate those projections. Discovery and Implementation steps show reliance on assumed numbers and computational validation only, so the criterion requiring comparable store performance data is not met."
