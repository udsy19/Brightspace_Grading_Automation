  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran code, reported the program outputs (NPV, IRR, payback), and stated they validated their hand calculations against the Python output and an online PV calculator. They also verbally connected key assumptions (depreciation tax shield, revenues, costs) to the resulting cash flows, satisfying the criterion fully.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes what the charts/tables show (cash flows, cumulative payback, code outputs) and explicitly states units (millions) and scenarios (base case vs. -20% revenue). Multiple visuals are verbally interpreted, satisfying both evaluation points with thoroughness appropriate for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performs and documents the Define & Discover stage at the start, capturing problem, parameters, objective, and stakeholder focus (shareholder value). Modeling and implementation steps (cash flows, code) occur afterward, satisfying the strict requirement that D be completed and documented before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off criterion. It neither quantifies debt tax shield versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction options nor links conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Content centers on project-level depreciation tax shield and NPV/IRR for Starbucks, which is unrelated to the required analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no substantive analysis of agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing/payout choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Content centers on project valuation and sensitivity, not stakeholder incentive divergence. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage or DFL, nor does it discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk. References to WACC and a revenue sensitivity reflect operating risk and hurdle-rate use, not leverage math, DFL, EPS/ROE impacts, or coverage ratios. Thus, it fails this criterion.",
