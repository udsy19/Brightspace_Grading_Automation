  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by discounting yearly cash flows at 8.5%, including initial investment, terminal value, and working capital recovery, and reported a precise NPV. They extended analysis with multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue and WACC) and reflected on implications, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp. Evidence spans Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, meeting the criterion comprehensively.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applies the NPV decision rule, explicitly accepting the project when NPV > 0 and rejecting when NPV < 0, and does so across multiple scenarios (base case, revenue reduction, WACC changes). The discussion links NPV sign to investment viability and demonstrates understanding beyond a single example, satisfying a thorough, conceptually solid treatment for a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both computed IRR (10.19%) and accurately defined it as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, then applied it across scenarios (including sensitivity), demonstrating strong conceptual grasp. Implementation evidence shows they operationalized the computation, and their reflection ties IRR meaningfully to decision thresholds (WACC). Minor phrasing issues aside, coverage is thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and correctly interpreted a profitability index of 1.08 and demonstrated discounted cash flow work with an explicit hurdle rate, supporting that PI was based on present values. However, they did not explicitly present the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show the calculation steps linking PV totals to the PI figure. The treatment is correct but basic, so this earns a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses operating cash flow, initial capex, and working capital recovery to build project cash flows, showing conceptual understanding of FCF components. However, they do not explicitly present FCF as OCF less capex and changes in working capital, nor quantify or discuss working capital changes beyond the upfront and end recovery, limiting depth. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies project-specific inflows/outflows and correctly treats working capital recovery and terminal value, showing a basic understanding of project-driven cash flows. However, they do not explicitly discuss the incremental principle (e.g., excluding sunk costs, non-incremental overhead/financing, opportunity costs, cannibalization), so coverage is not thorough.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented key cost and project assumptions (initial investment, operating costs, WACC, terminal value) and ran sensitivity tests, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not validate or justify the $12M construction/real-estate figure or the $3M terminal value (no breakdown, source, or rationale), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

      "reasoning": "The student clearly communicates the analysis workflow (Define/Discover, Implement, Reflect), provides specific numerical inputs and outcome metrics (e.g., NPV/IRR), and draws actionable conclusions about sensitivity and risk. Coverage is detailed and coherent across DRIVER stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough explanation."
