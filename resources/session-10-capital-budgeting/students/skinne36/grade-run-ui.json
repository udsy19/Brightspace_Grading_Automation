  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a clear base-case NPV/IRR and runs at least two sensitivities (20% revenue drop and ±2% WACC) with quantitative outcomes showing where the project flips from viable to not (NPV positive → negative; IRR < WACC). They also discuss implications and mitigation, meeting the criterion's requirement for base plus sensitivities and highlighting stakeholder-preference breakpoints.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they stored data and wrote/used code, reports concrete computed outputs, and verbally links those outputs to key assumptions (terminal value, revenue reduction, WACC). This shows both execution of code and validation of results against expectations, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student repeatedly and clearly narrates what the tables/charts show, citing specific figures, units (dollars, percentages, years), and scenarios (base, revenue reduction, WACC changes). The walkthrough covers inputs, operating and consolidated cash flows, discount factors, and scenario NPVs/IRR, providing thorough, comprehensible descriptions that support capital allocation decisions.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, provides no quantification of tax advantages or expected distress/optionality costs for payout vs. debt reduction choices, and makes no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. The DRIVER stages applied to a Starbucks project evaluation, not the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting. Despite adequate DRIVER process on capital budgeting, the criterion is missing entirely, so it fails under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The analysis focuses on project cash flows, WACC changes, and revenue sensitivity without connecting capital structure to equity returns or risk, which is required for this criterion.",
