  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly references a Python script, states they implemented it, and presents concrete outputs (IRR = 17.65%, NPV = $5.47M) tied to stated assumptions (8.5% WACC, revenue/COGS/depreciation). They also interpret those outputs against expectations (IRR > WACC → accept) and discuss sensitivity, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, stakeholder context, and the objective (earn more than WACC) at the start and explicitly notes that Define & Discover were completed before representation and implementation. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit, up-front D-stage, so the criterion passes.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission specifies the metrics to be produced, describes a represent step before implementation, and demonstrates linkage by producing computed outputs and sensitivity scenarios via a Python script. This shows a systematic plan-to-implementation workflow consistent with the DRIVER framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off among buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, does not quantify tax shield benefits or expected distress/optionality costs, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. It focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and hurdle rate, which is outside the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor who gains/loses under different choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the absence of these concepts, even at a conceptual level, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not present DFL or leverage math, and omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. While it discusses WACC, revenue sensitivity, and general risk, it never analyzes leverage effects or debt-related downside, which are required for this criterion.",
