  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained NPV conceptually, applied the 8.5% WACC, incorporated initial investment and cash flow drivers, and produced a specific NPV result with sensitivity analysis. The DISCOVER, REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE stages collectively demonstrate thorough and accurate treatment suitable for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV, calculates it, and applies the decision rule by accepting when NPV is positive and rejecting under adverse scenarios, also checking sensitivity to WACC. Multiple applications (base case, downside, and WACC sensitivity) show a thorough, decision-oriented use of NPV, meeting the criterion at a PASS level under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated capital budgeting calculations via a Python script and reported multiple computed metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback) along with sensitivity insights, demonstrating application beyond a single calculation. The linkage to DRIVER (implementing code, validating outputs) and the inclusion of scenario analysis provide sufficient depth for a thorough, PASS-level treatment under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR and applies the decision rule (IRR > WACC) but does not explain or demonstrate that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor show how it was computed from cash flows. Given the moderate standard, this shows basic understanding but lacks the depth and explicit linkage to the NPV=0 definition needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified the payback timing as occurring in year six and linked it to project risk, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not provide detailed cumulative cash flow analysis or clarify simple vs. discounted payback, offering only selected-year figures. Given the moderate standard, this is accurate but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies the PI value (1.44) and correctly notes that PI > 1 indicates acceptance, showing conceptual understanding. However, they misstate the interpretation (“$144” per $1 instead of $1.44) and do not demonstrate or explain the calculation as PV of benefits divided by initial investment.

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — student clearly defined the problem, key parameters, and assumptions; Implement — student built and ran a Python script and reported outputs; Represent/Validate — student interpreted IRR, NPV, PI, performed sensitivity checks and discussed strategic risks and benefits.",
      "reasoning": "The student demonstrates a thorough, structured use of the DRIVER framework: they defined the scenario and assumptions (Discover), implemented calculations with code (Implement), and interpreted results including sensitivity and qualitative factors (Represent/Validate). Explanations include specific metrics (NPV $5.47M, IRR 17.65%, WACC 8.5%) and clear decision rationale, meeting the standard for a PASS."
