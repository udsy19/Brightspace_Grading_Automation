  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the problem context and laid out a three-step plan (go/no-go, engine room, stress test) at the start, then proceeded to build models in subsequent blocks. This meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be documented and completed before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly described a pre-implementation plan of models, scenarios, and metrics (go/no-go, engine room, stress test) and then mapped that plan to implemented artifacts (cash-flow arrays, tax/depreciation handling, NPV/IRR outputs and sensitivity graph). This demonstrates a systematic represent-to-implement linkage, meeting the moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student outlined a clear multi-stage plan and then executed it: running blocks (library install and metric calculations), building operating cash flows with depreciation/tax-shield mechanics, and performing verification and sensitivity visualization. These traceable steps align implementation with the Represent plan and include intermediate checks, meeting the moderate PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off among buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction, does not quantify tax shield benefits versus expected distress/flexibility costs for each alternative, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on project NPV and depreciation tax shield for a Starbucks case, which misses this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and it omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Content remains on NPV/IRR mechanics and tax shields, with only a cursory mention of “shareholder value,” so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how financing choice or leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, does not present DFL/ROE/EPS math, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Content is limited to NPV/IRR, cash flow tax shields, and WACC sensitivity, which does not meet this criterion even under moderate strictness.",
