  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains NPV, structures cash flows with a negative t=0 outlay, discounts future flows at WACC, and reports/interprets a computed NPV. They further apply NPV in stress testing and integrate it with constructed operating cash flows, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention. This meets the moderate standard for thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both computed IRR and demonstrated correct conceptual understanding that IRR is the discount rate where NPV equals zero, evidenced by the zero-crossing explanation and the reported IRR value. The combination of calculation and visualization reflects a thorough, applied treatment consistent with the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly constructed cash flows, ran the code themselves using numpy_financial, and reported numeric NPV and IRR outputs while describing verification and stress-testing steps. This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level understanding, and ownership, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV accept/reject rule and applies it to a concrete example, concluding acceptance due to a positive NPV, and supports it with a sensitivity visualization. However, the treatment is brief and lacks deeper coverage (e.g., edge cases or broader decision contexts), so it demonstrates correct but basic understanding suitable for PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated a payback period (“four years”), showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain the method (cumulative cash flow recovery), provide supporting cash flow detail, or specify simple vs. discounted payback. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never defines, calculates, or interprets the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). Although they present initial outlay and PV of operating cash flows, they do not form the PI ratio or discuss its meaning. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual mention would suffice, but it is absent; thus, the criterion fails.",
