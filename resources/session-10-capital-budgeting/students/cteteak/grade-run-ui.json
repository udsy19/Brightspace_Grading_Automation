  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides a clear base-case model and at least two explicit sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), quantifies their impacts, and identifies breakpoints where the recommendation changes (large negative NPV on revenue shock; IRR < WACC at 10.5%). Coverage is specific and shows a strong, applied understanding of scenario/sensitivity analysis.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables/charts show (cash flow schedule, metric outputs) and explains units and scenarios (dollars, percentages, base vs 20% revenue cut, WACC shifts), including implications for shareholders and liquidity. Multiple scenarios and detailed figures indicate thorough treatment across Represent, Implement, and Validate stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built and discussed sensitivity/stress tests on key drivers (revenue/FCF variability and WACC), quantified impacts on NPV/IRR, and explicitly showed how results change the preferred option and risk profile. While tax rate wasn’t tested, the depth across multiple sensitivities and clear decision implications meet the moderate standard for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion or quantification of tax advantages versus expected financial distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices is provided, and there is no linkage to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. The submission focuses on Starbucks project NPV/IRR sensitivities, which does not address this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss stakeholder incentive divergence, who gains/loses, or agency conflicts, and omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. A single mention of “shareholder value” is insufficient for this criterion, even under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how leverage changes ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or explain DFL, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics under different debt choices. The work remains at NPV/IRR/WACC sensitivity, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
