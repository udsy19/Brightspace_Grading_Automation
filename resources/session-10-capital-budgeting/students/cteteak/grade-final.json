  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified the initial investment, constructed detailed future free cash flows, and applied the stated discount rate to compute and report NPV. They also used NPV in sensitivity analysis and decision-making, demonstrating depth beyond a basic mention. This satisfies a thorough, conceptually strong treatment appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule (positive NPV adds value/accept; negative NPV implies reject) and demonstrates it across multiple scenarios (base case, WACC increase, revenue drop). The discussion ties NPV sign to the accept/reject decision and shows awareness of how assumption changes flip the decision, meeting a thorough, application-oriented understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed IRR, compared it to the hurdle rate, and re-estimated IRR under a downside scenario, showing application beyond a single case. They also articulated that IRR is internal to cash flows and independent of the discount rate used for NPV sensitivity, demonstrating solid conceptual understanding. This depth and correct usage across DRIVER stages merits a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a PI of 1.05 and provided the intuitive interpretation (“just over a dollar for every dollar invested”), showing conceptual understanding. They also set up discounted cash flows and the initial outlay, implying the correct basis for PI. However, they did not show or discuss the actual “PV of benefits” figure or the formula, and provided no deeper analysis or sensitivity of PI, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly includes capex and working capital changes (initial deployment and recovery) and builds FCF from after-tax operating results with a depreciation add-back, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is not thorough: they do not explicitly articulate FCF as operating cash flow less capex and changes in working capital across periods or provide detailed calculations, so coverage remains basic rather than in-depth.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly outlines key incremental cash flow elements (capex, working capital investment and recovery, NOPAT with depreciation add-back, terminal value) and separates discounting via WACC. However, they do not explicitly address excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, cannibalization/opportunity costs), so coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.",
