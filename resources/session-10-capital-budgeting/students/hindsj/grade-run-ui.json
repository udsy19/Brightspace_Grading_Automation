  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a clear base case (NPV $2.6M, IRR 12.84% > 8.5% hurdle) and multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%) with quantified effects. They explicitly identify a decision breakpoint (revenue -20% causes NPV/IRR to fall below the hurdle and flips the recommendation) and discuss stakeholder implications, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running code in Google Colab and presents concrete results (NPV, IRR, payback) plus sensitivity checks (20% revenue shock and WACC shifts), demonstrating they validated outputs against expectations. They also explain key assumptions and how those drive the reported outcomes, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes what the charts/tables show and interprets results with specific units (millions of dollars, percentages, years) and scenarios (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%). They connect these visuals to capital allocation trade-offs by highlighting how scenario changes affect NPV and IRR. This is thorough and aligned with the DRIVER stages, satisfying a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off (debt tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs) or compare buybacks/dividends/debt reduction. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Mention of depreciation tax shields is project-level, not capital-structure, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts, who gains/loses, or why incentives diverge, and does not mention leverage, buybacks, asset substitution, or risk-shifting. All DRIVER stages are applied to valuation mechanics and revenue risk, leaving this criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or demonstrate DFL, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The analysis centers on WACC-based valuation and revenue sensitivity, with no leverage math or capital structure implications. Hence, under this criterion, it fails.",
