  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, applied grasp of NPV: they specify the initial outlay, construct a 0–10 year cash flow schedule, apply the 8.5% WACC, report an NPV ($2.6M), and analyze sensitivity to discount rate and revenue. This goes beyond a basic mention by showing comprehensive application and implications, satisfying the moderate standard for thoroughness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated comprehensive capital budgeting calculations (FCF build, NPV, IRR, paybacks, PI) and scenario analysis via Python, indicating depth beyond basic execution. Evidence of code-driven workflow, an executive dashboard, and sensitivity analysis demonstrates thorough, applied integration of finance and technology suitable for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student performed a multi-scenario sensitivity analysis with quantified impacts on NPV and IRR and drew actionable insights about revenue-volume risk. Implementation details (Python/Colab, visualization) and the Evolve-stage discussion show a thorough, not just superficial, treatment appropriate for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed a positive NPV and recommended acceptance, showing basic understanding that the project creates value at the 8.5% WACC. However, they did not explicitly articulate the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) and leaned on IRR and payback for justification, with imprecise phrasing around NPV. This supports a correct but incomplete treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and used IRR (12.84%) appropriately in decision-making and sensitivity discussion, showing basic understanding. However, their explanation of IRR was superficial and somewhat inaccurate (describing it as “how much we’re going to return”), without articulating that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero. Depth and conceptual precision are insufficient for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and stated both simple and discounted payback and accurately interpreted simple payback. However, the treatment is basic: no methodological detail, limited discussion of discounted vs. simple payback implications, and reliance on the simple metric in the narrative. This shows sound understanding but not thorough coverage, warranting PARTIAL.",
