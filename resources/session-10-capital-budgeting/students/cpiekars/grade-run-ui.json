  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly announces and documents a Define/Discover stage and lists project inputs and analysis requirements before showing the code/modeling. There is no indication the D-stage was done post‑hoc, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified the modeling plan (cash-flow schedule, metrics, and sensitivity scenarios) before implementation and then implemented those elements in code (helper functions, cash flows, NPV/IRR, and sensitivity runs). This shows a systematic linkage from the Represent-stage plan to implemented artifacts, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student shows a systematic execution of the Represent plan: they defined helper functions, constructed year-by-year cash flows (including working capital and terminal value), computed core metrics, and ran sensitivity scenarios with printed outputs for validation. This traceable workflow across Represent → Implement → Validate meets the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs at all, nor Apple. It only covers project-level cash flows and metrics and mentions depreciation tax shields, not interest tax shields or financial distress/flexibility costs. Given the complete mismatch with the criterion and lack of quantification or Apple linkage, this fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across stakeholders, who gains/loses, or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite using DRIVER stages, the content does not engage this criterion, so the score is FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or calculations of financial leverage effects, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. It focuses on capital budgeting (WACC, NPV/IRR, sensitivity) without addressing financing choice impacts, which are required for this criterion even at a conceptual level.",
