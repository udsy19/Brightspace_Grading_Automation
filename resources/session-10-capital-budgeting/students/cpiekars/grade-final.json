  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly planned and executed the required sensitivity tests (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%) using Python and reported the resulting NPV/IRR values, demonstrating implementation and validation. They described the code structure (helper functions, cash-flow construction) and presented outputs, meeting the strict requirement for explicit execution and block-level understanding.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated a comprehensive capital budgeting workflow in Python, including programmatic cash flow construction, core metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback, discounted payback), and sensitivity analyses on revenue and WACC, and presented computed outputs. Given the moderate standard, the detailed description of helper functions, loops, and multiple automated outputs demonstrates thorough integration of technology in capital budgeting, aligned with Discover and Implement stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the investment problem (size, duration, revenues/costs) and the decision criterion (8.5% WACC) and stated they would use the DRIVER framework to define variables and build the cash-flow model. These clear, specific statements demonstrate the Define & Discover stage as required.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and reports NPV using the stated discount rate, includes the initial outlay, and performs relevant sensitivity, demonstrating a sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief and lacks detailed explanation of the NPV mechanics or step-by-step present value aggregation, so it falls short of the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated NPV at the stated WACC and observed scenarios where NPV turns negative, showing basic understanding that NPV informs accept/reject. However, they did not explicitly articulate the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) or give a clear accept/reject conclusion based on their results. Coverage is correct but brief, so Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR value and included it among the project metrics, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain that IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero, nor did they demonstrate or validate this property, resulting in a correct but surface-level treatment. Therefore, this meets a basic standard but lacks the thoroughness needed for a PASS.",
