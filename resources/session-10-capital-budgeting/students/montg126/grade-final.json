  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by explicitly including CF0 (not discounted), discounting future cash flows at WACC, and incorporating terminal value and working capital timing. They provide a base-case NPV with figures and multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%) that affect NPV as expected. This is thorough and application-driven, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule across base and multiple sensitivity scenarios, explicitly accepting when NPV is positive and rejecting when negative, using WACC as the hurdle rate. Multiple applications and clear accept/reject statements show a strong, thorough grasp consistent with a PASS under a moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described and implemented the cash-flow calculation blocks, ran the model code, and produced quantitative outputs (NPV, IRR) along with sensitivity tests, demonstrating ownership and verification of projections. These concrete statements across Represent, Implement, and Validate meet the strict Technical Implementation requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (13.25%) and compared it to WACC to inform the decision, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or show deeper analysis (e.g., methodology, IRR sensitivity), so the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and reported both simple and discounted payback, demonstrating conceptual understanding and implementation. However, they did not provide a detailed explanation of the calculation method, show cumulative cash flow recovery steps, or discuss implications of the payback results. Thus, coverage is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported a PI (1.242) and showed awareness that the initial outlay (CF0) is not discounted, indicating basic understanding. However, they did not explicitly explain PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment or show the PV of benefits, so coverage is correct but not thorough.",
