  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%) and reported resulting NPVs and decisions. They explicitly identified a breakpoint where a 20% revenue shortfall flips accept → reject, satisfying the requirement to highlight where stakeholder preference shifts. The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) are present and used to generate and interpret these scenarios.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, printed results, and performed validation scenarios. They also link key assumptions (revenues, depreciation, WACC) to numeric outcomes (NPV, IRR, sensitivity), demonstrating a coherent verification of outputs.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student embedded sensitivity testing (revenue and WACC) into the model, quantified impacts on NPV, and explicitly linked results to accept/reject decisions and risk posture. While taxes weren’t varied, the analysis is sufficiently thorough for a moderate standard, demonstrating how key driver shocks alter the project’s risk profile and decision.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis and does not discuss buyback/dividend/debt reduction trade-offs, quantify tax shield benefits vs. distress/flexibility costs, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. While DRIVER is used, it structures a different task, not the required capital structure trade-off analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing/payout choices, or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Across the DRIVER stages, the work remains limited to project cash flows and sensitivity, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Risk discussion is limited to operating/revenue sensitivity rather than financial leverage implications. Despite clear DRIVER use for cash flow modeling, the criterion’s leverage-specific requirements are missing.",
