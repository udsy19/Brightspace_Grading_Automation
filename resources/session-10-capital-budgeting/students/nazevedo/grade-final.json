  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid, applied understanding of NPV: defines the rule in present-value terms, explicitly accounts for the initial outlay at year 0, and describes discounting future cash flows using the hurdle rate. They compute and interpret NPV results, including sensitivities, showing comprehensive application across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0) and applies it to the base case and multiple sensitivities, explicitly tying accept/reject to the sign of NPV. They use the 8.5% WACC as the hurdle/discount rate and demonstrate decisions across scenarios, showing a thorough and correct understanding aligned with DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identified and treated only project-caused cash flows: upfront investment, working capital changes, operating cash flows, terminal value, and working capital recovery. They also emphasized non-cash depreciation and its tax effect on FCF, showing sound incremental cash flow reasoning. This coverage is thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes IRR, computes it in code, and applies it by comparing IRR to the hurdle rate, including under sensitivity scenarios. However, they do not explain IRR conceptually as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, show the computation mechanics, or provide specific IRR values. The treatment is correct but basic, aligning with a PARTIAL under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student only mentions payback period as an intended metric but provides no conceptual explanation, calculation, or result for either simple or discounted payback. Given the moderate standard, at least a brief conceptual determination or stated payback year was needed; since none is provided across Implement/Validate/Reflect, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never defines or calculates the profitability index as present value of benefits divided by initial investment. While PI is listed among intended metrics, the implemented analysis and conclusions rely on NPV and IRR only, with no conceptual or numerical treatment of PI. Under moderate strictness, a conceptual explanation would suffice, but it is absent.",
