  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included a base case plus explicit sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC variations), provided numeric outcomes (best/worst NPV) and identified that a ~20% revenue drop flips the decision — plus recommended mitigation. The Represent/Implement/Validate stages collectively demonstrate a thorough sensitivity analysis and clear breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, performed stress tests, and recalculated scenarios, and provides numeric outcomes. They also verbally explain key assumptions (e.g., depreciation as non‑cash leading to positive FCF) that align with the reported results, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the problem statement, stakeholders/objective, and catalogs inputs before modeling (\"don't miss anything before we actually start coding\") and states that coding began only after those definitions. Although sensitivity scenarios were added later in validate, the D-stage was clearly completed and documented prior to implementation, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off (tax shield benefits vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) or compare buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/WACC/sensitivity, with no quantification of tax advantages or distress/optionality costs.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across stakeholders, who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Content focuses on project NPV and operating sensitivity, not financial leverage or incentive divergence. Under the moderate standard, this remains missing, so the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on operating leverage and NPV/WACC sensitivity, not financial leverage. It lacks DFL math, any link to ROE/EPS volatility, and does not address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Given these omissions, it does not meet the criterion.",
