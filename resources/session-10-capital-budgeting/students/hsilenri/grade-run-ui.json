  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base-case valuation plus multiple sensitivities (20% revenue shock and WACC sweep), quantified outcomes (NPV +2.69M base, -3.08M downside) and explicitly identified breakpoints (discount-rate break-even ~10.5% and revenue level causing NPV to flip). Their Evolve and Implement stages show applied scenario analysis and translated results into stakeholder implications, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran a Python script and showed outputs, documents the model logic and key assumptions (revenues, fixed costs, depreciation), and verbally confirms a manual year‑1 calculation matches the model. This clear implement+validate sequence demonstrates valid code execution and reasonable verification, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly describes what the visuals show (bars for cash flows, axes for NPV vs discount rate) and explains units and scenarios with specific figures, covering base case and sensitivities. The Implement and Evolve stages explicitly reference and interpret the charts/tables, meeting the criterion at a detailed, decision-relevant level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs (buybacks/dividends/debt reduction) or quantify debt tax shields vs. expected distress/flexibility costs, nor does it connect to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Content focuses on a Starbucks project’s depreciation tax shield and NPV, which is off-scope for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across stakeholders, nor identification of who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. While the DRIVER stages are present, they focus on NPV mechanics and operating risk, not the required agency-conflict analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage or DFL, provide EPS/ROE volatility implications under different financing choices, or address bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. While operating leverage and revenue risk are covered, the specific criterion on financial leverage effects is missing, leading to a fail under the moderate standard.",
