  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applies NPV: defines the rule, specifies discount rate, details initial outlay and cash flows, reports computed NPV, and analyzes sensitivity to discount rate and revenue. The Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages substantiate correct calculation and understanding beyond surface level, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV accept/reject rule and applies it with specific results (positive base-case NPV leading to acceptance; negative NPV under revenue stress signaling risk). They also examine discount-rate sensitivity, demonstrating robust application beyond a surface mention. Minor verbal slips (MPV/MPB) do not detract from a thorough, correct treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately modeled free cash flow as operating results (after tax, with depreciation add-back) and explicitly incorporated capital expenditures and working capital changes (initial injection and recovery), with specific dollar amounts. They validated a period’s FCF manually and tied it to the model output, demonstrating a thorough, correct application across DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly reports an IRR (12.84%) and conceptually links NPV vs discount rate to a break-even point, then applies IRR in the decision. However, they do not thoroughly explain or demonstrate computing IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero (no method or verification that NPV=0 at 12.84%), so coverage is correct but basic, fitting PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never determines or discusses the time required to recover the initial investment. While the cash flow schedule would allow such a calculation, they only report NPV, IRR, and PI, with no payback metric or timing stated. Given the omission, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a Profitability Index (1.22x) and provides the initial investment and cash flow context, indicating they likely computed it. However, they do not explain the PI concept (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show the calculation, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",
