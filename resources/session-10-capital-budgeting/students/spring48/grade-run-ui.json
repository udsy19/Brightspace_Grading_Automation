  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a clear base-case valuation and multiple sensitivity scenarios (20% revenue drop and ±2% WACC), and explicitly identifies that a 20% revenue decline flips NPV negative and IRR below WACC — a stakeholder preference breakpoint from accept to reject. This meets the criterion for scenario/sensitivity analysis with highlighted breakpoints; depth is adequate for a moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described a pre-implementation plan (cash‑flow structure, metrics, scenarios) and then implemented it, producing the 10-year pro forma, core capital‑budgeting metrics, and sensitivity analyses. This clear plan-to-artifact linkage demonstrates a systematic approach consistent with the REPRESENT → IMPLEMENT stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed the planned analysis in a systematic way: they described and built the specified year 0–10 incremental cash-flow schedule, produced core outputs (NPV, IRR, PI, payback), and ran sensitivity scenarios tied to decision rules. Intermediate commentary links execution to goals (accept/reject based on NPV and IRR), satisfying the Implement-stage requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, nor quantify tax advantages or distress/flexibility costs. It is entirely a project valuation for Starbucks and lacks any linkage to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify stakeholder gains/losses or divergent incentives across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and it omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage/buybacks. Given the absence of these concepts across the DRIVER stages, it fails this criterion despite otherwise solid capital budgeting analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage (DFL), EPS/ROE sensitivity to financing choice, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. It centers on NPV/IRR and revenue/WACC sensitivities only, which is insufficient for this criterion under the moderate standard.",
