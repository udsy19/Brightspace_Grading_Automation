  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately set up NPV with WACC 8.5%, included the initial outlay (12M plus 0.5M working capital), and reported an NPV of about $2.3M, demonstrating correct interpretation of accept/reject criteria. Sensitivity to discount rate further shows applied understanding of present value mechanics. Given the moderate standard, this constitutes a thorough and correct treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule and applies it to the project, explicitly accepting when NPV > 0. They compute and use NPV in the base case and discuss sensitivity, indicating awareness that negative NPV implies rejection. This demonstrates thorough, conceptually sound treatment aligned with DRIVER stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: Student explicitly states they automated the calculations in Python and produced a full multi-year cash flow model with NPV, IRR, PI, and payback, plus scenario analyses, indicating comprehensive application. Under moderate strictness, this demonstrates thorough integration of technology to automate capital budgeting.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (base case and a revenue-downside scenario) and used it for decision-making, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero or show computation detail/derivation, and coverage was brief rather than thorough, so this meets a basic but not comprehensive standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported both simple and discounted payback, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is not thorough (no methodology or cumulative cash flow demonstration) and includes an accuracy issue (discounted payback stated as a percent rather than years). This supports a Partial rather than a Pass under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes a profitability index and interprets the >1 decision rule, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain or show that PI is calculated as the present value of benefits divided by the initial investment, and they mislabel it as a percent. Depth and calculation details are missing, so this meets basic but not thorough treatment.",
