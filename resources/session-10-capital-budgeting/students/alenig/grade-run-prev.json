  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV, states the discounting and subtraction of the initial investment, and demonstrates application with computed NPVs across base and sensitivity scenarios. The discussion connects NPV to decision-making and shows understanding of drivers (WACC, revenue), meeting the moderate standard with thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if positive, reject if negative) and applies it to base and sensitivity cases with specific NPVs. They integrate this into the accept/reject recommendation, demonstrating a thorough, accurate understanding suitable for the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and applies it by computing IRR for base and sensitivity cases. They interpret results against WACC and note IRR’s invariance to WACC changes, demonstrating a solid, applied understanding suitable for the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the concept of payback and discounted payback and applies them, noting recovery occurs beyond the project life. However, they misstate the simple payback formula (using average cash flows) and incorrectly claim discounted payback decreases when WACC increases. These inaccuracies indicate a basic but incomplete understanding, warranting a partial score under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student includes the correct components (operating items, capex, and working capital changes) in constructing project cash flows, implicitly aligning with FCF. However, they do not explicitly define or separate operating cash flow from free cash flow nor state the FCF formula (OCF − Capex − ΔWC), making the treatment basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student constructs project-specific cash flows (capex, working capital changes, operating cash items, terminal value), which aligns with incremental cash-flow modeling. However, they do not explicitly state the incremental principle or discuss exclusions like sunk costs, financing flows, or opportunity costs/cannibalization, leaving gaps for a thorough treatment. Hence, a partial score is warranted under the moderate standard.",
