  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines NPV, describes discounting and subtracting the initial investment, and applies it using the project’s WACC. They present concrete NPV results for the base case and multiple sensitivity scenarios, and interpret implications for decision-making. This demonstrates thorough conceptual understanding and application sufficient for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and then applied it with computed values for the base case and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating understanding beyond a surface-level definition. They also correctly noted that changing WACC does not change IRR, using IRR in decision-making comparisons, which reflects thorough and accurate conceptual and applied grasp under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines PI as present value of future benefits divided by the initial investment and applies the >1 threshold. They also compute and interpret PI across scenarios (e.g., base PI 1.24), demonstrating application and understanding. This satisfies a thorough, conceptually solid treatment under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; negative NPV implies value destruction) to the base case and a sensitivity scenario. However, the treatment is basic, lacking deeper discussion (e.g., zero NPV indifference, choosing among alternatives, prioritization of NPV versus other metrics). Hence, this meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguished simple vs. discounted payback and produced a (discounted) payback estimate, interpreting that recovery exceeds the project life. However, they included inaccuracies (simple payback as initial investment divided by average cash flows; claiming discounted payback decreases when WACC increases), indicating gaps in accuracy. This supports a correct-but-incomplete understanding, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly incorporated operating items, initial CapEx, and working capital changes into the cash-flow build, demonstrating a basic conceptual grasp of free cash flow. However, they did not explicitly define or calculate FCF as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus changes in working capital, nor did they show the OCF step distinctly. Given the moderate standard, this supports a correct but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student documents key cost inputs (12M initial investment, working capital) and encodes them in the model, and they reflect on construction/execution risk. However they do not validate or justify the real estate/construction cost assumptions in detail (no breakdown, no sources, no contingency quantified in the base case), only high-level discussion and an admission that overruns were not modeled. This merits PARTIAL."
