  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported quantitative outcomes, and explicitly noted that a 20% revenue decline flips the project from positive NPV/PI>1 to negative NPV/PI<1—i.e., a stakeholder decision breakpoint. Coverage is specific, numerically supported, and tied to decision implications, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student verbally indicates code execution, presents specific numerical outputs (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity cases), and links those results back to stated assumptions and logic, meeting the criterion for confirmation and validation. Under the moderate standard, this depth of discussion and reported outputs warrants a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what the tables/visuals show, identifying units (millions, percentages), key rows, cumulative cash flows, and scenario outputs. They explicitly explain scenarios and interpret differences across them, clarifying capital allocation trade-offs. Given the moderate standard, this depth and specificity merit a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off at all: no quantification of debt tax shield benefits, distress/optionality costs, or comparison of buyback/dividend/debt reduction. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The only “tax shield” reference is project-level depreciation, not financing-related.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. While the student executed and reflected on valuation metrics and operational risks, they omitted stakeholder incentive misalignments entirely, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financing choice, DFL math, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside/bankruptcy risk, nor does it discuss coverage metrics. It focuses on project valuation (NPV/IRR/payback/PI) and revenue/WACC sensitivity, leaving the leverage criterion unaddressed.",
