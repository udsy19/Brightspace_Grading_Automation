  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed a base case plus multiple sensitivities (WAC ±2% and revenue ±20%), reported quantitative impacts (NPV/IRR/PI) and explicitly identified breakpoints where the project shifts from value-creating to value-destroying (revenue -20% → NPV negative; WAC threshold ~6.5–10.5). This meets the criterion thoroughly, with both analysis and actionable interpretation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student verbally reports specific computed outputs (NPV, IRR, PI), shows that assumptions were parameterized, and ties results to expectations (IRR > WAC, revenue downside flips NPV). They also describe sensitivity testing and interpretation, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matched logic.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what each chart/table shows, references units (millions, percent WACC, years), and explains scenarios (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%) and their effects on NPV/IRR. They connect visuals to capital allocation trade-offs over time (initial outlay vs terminal inflow) and risk impacts on shareholder value. Given the depth and clarity across multiple visuals and scenarios, this meets a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires evaluating the capital structure trade-off—quantifying tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices—and tying conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet. The submission focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis, with only a depreciation tax shield mention and no discussion or quantification of capital structure trade-offs or Apple-specific context. Thus, despite clear DRIVER usage, the required concept is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Focus remained on capital budgeting metrics and demand/WACC sensitivity, which does not satisfy this criterion even under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or debt coverage metrics. While the student thoroughly handles unlevered cash flows and WACC sensitivity, there is no conceptual or quantitative treatment of leverage effects, which is required for this criterion even under moderate strictness.",
