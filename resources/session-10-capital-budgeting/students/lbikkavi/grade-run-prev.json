  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly modeled discounted cash flows, explicitly computed NPV (~$3M), and analyzed its sensitivity to WACC and revenue, correctly explaining that NPV declines as the discount rate rises and identifying the IRR where NPV equals zero. Multiple applications (base case, WACC, and revenue scenarios) and clear interpretation demonstrate a strong, comprehensive grasp of NPV within the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV > 0 (base case ≈ $3M) and recognize value destruction/rejection when NPV < 0 (−20% revenue scenario). They reinforce this via DRIVER stages with implementation and sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a specific IRR (~13.3%), explained its relationship to NPV=0 via the NPV–WACC graph, and applied it in decision-making against WACC. This shows accurate conceptual understanding and practical application across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness needed for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported NPV (~$3M) and IRR (~13.3%) and referenced functions plus an NPV–WACC crossover for validation. However, under strict technical standards, they did not explicitly demonstrate the code logic, step-by-step verification, or show that plugging the IRR yields NPV ≈ 0. Thus, evidence supports understanding and results but lacks explicit implementation proof, earning PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student identifies all drivers and components and narrates the 0–10 cash-flow build with some concrete figures (e.g., -$12.5M at t0, $1.2M depreciation annually, year-10 WC recovery and terminal value leading to ~$5.3M inflow). However, under strict standards, they do not explicitly show the per-year cash-flow table, code logic, or a step-by-step verification of accuracy. This demonstrates partial but not fully explicit technical implementation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly explains the mechanics (straight-line depreciation, tax shield, taxes on EBIT only when positive) and ties them to OCF, but under strict standards they do not explicitly demonstrate code or per-year tax/depreciation calculations. The stated \"tax rate 200 percent\" also introduces a parameter error not resolved. Hence, solid conceptual grasp but insufficient explicit technical proof yields PARTIAL.",
