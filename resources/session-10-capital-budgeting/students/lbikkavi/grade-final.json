  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied and interpreted NPV: constructed incremental cash flows, discounted at WACC, included initial outlay and terminal/wc recovery, reported base-case NPV, and analyzed sensitivity to discount rate and revenue. The DRIVER stages show implementation with code, validation via scenarios, and reflection on NPV implications, meeting a comprehensive, conceptually accurate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule, recommending acceptance with a positive NPV and identifying value destruction when NPV turns negative. They deepen this with sensitivity analysis and interpretation across DRIVER stages, showing thorough, conceptually sound understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported IRR, correctly related it to the hurdle rate, and explicitly recognized IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero via the NPV–WACC graph. The inclusion of coded functions, a numeric IRR, and validation through sensitivity analysis demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with a PASS in a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and interprets the profitability index and provides a specific value (1.24) tied to decision-making, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not demonstrate the calculation mechanics (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or detail how PV benefits were derived, so coverage is correct but brief rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual understanding of OCF mechanics (EBIT less taxes plus depreciation) and applies it across the timeline, noting the depreciation tax shield and OCF behavior. However, they do not explicitly present the OCF formula (EBIT × (1–T) + Depreciation) or work through a concrete numeric example, so the treatment is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies and includes both working capital recovery and a terminal (salvage) value, and explains their impact on year-10 cash flow. However, treatment lacks depth: there’s no discussion of after-tax treatment of salvage proceeds or potential selling costs. Given the moderate standard, this shows sound conceptual understanding but not thorough coverage, so PARTIAL.",

        "\"The goal of my assignment is we're taking a company, Starbucks, which is very well known, and we're considering a $12 million flagship roastery that runs for 10 years, right? So this is like the business that we're currently evaluating.\"",
        "\"for the actual driver framework i think i did go through this pretty decently but i'll just quickly skim through it here but um again define i state that very clearly at the beginning identify what the required outputs are discover i do gather all the information that i need so all the project assumptions...\"",
        "\"NPV is approximately 3 million, IRR is approximately 13.3%, and the PI is going to be 1.24... final recommendation base case is value creating... recommend accept but monitor demand such traffic risk carefully.\""

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: clearly stated task, scope, and assumptions (project, revenues, costs).\n- Represent: converted assumptions into a parameterized model and documented variables/ depreciation/ revenue schedule.\n- Implement: ran base-case metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback) and showed code/functions.\n- Validate/Evolve: performed sensitivity (WACC ±2%, revenue shock) and reported impacts.\n- Reflect: interpreted results and gave a recommendation with risk caveats.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides a thorough, structured explanation following the DRIVER stages, with specific assumptions, modeled metrics, sensitivity analysis, and a clear recommendation. This level of detail and explicit mapping to DRIVER demonstrates strong, comprehensive communication and satisfies the PASS standard."
