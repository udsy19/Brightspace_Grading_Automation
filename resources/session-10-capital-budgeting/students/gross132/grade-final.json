You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by discounting future cash flows, explicitly including the initial outflow in year 0, and summing to an NPV figure, while explaining the time value rationale and acceptance rule. Implementation details and results are presented, and reflection connects NPV to decision-making and sensitivity, meeting a comprehensive, conceptually solid treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and correctly applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0) and explains why, showing conceptual understanding. They connect the rule to time value of money and apply it to the project’s computed NPV, demonstrating thoroughness consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the correct OCF formula (OCF = EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation), correctly defines EBIT with depreciation included in operating costs, and details depreciation treatment. This is a thorough, accurate application within the context of the project, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR in decision-making and contextualized it on an NPV profile, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly define IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero nor detail how the computation achieves that, so coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a discounted payback period and linked it to the cumulative discounted cash flow visualization, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic: no step-by-step derivation, no contrast with simple payback, and limited depth on methodology. Under moderate standards, this supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a profitability index value and demonstrated discounted cash flow computation, implying PV of benefits was calculated. However, they did not explain the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show how the 1.22 was derived, limiting depth. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "The student explicitly used and named stages across the framework: Discover/Define (problem description and parameters), Represent/Implement (Python code, calculations), Validate/Evolve (J‑curve, NPV profile and sensitivity), and Reflect (final recommendation and conceptual summary). These stages show organized application of the DRIVER framework to explain and evaluate the investment.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, specific explanation of capital‑budgeting concepts, applies them with numerical results, and walks through DRIVER stages from definition to reflection. The combination of conceptual explanation, worked example with outputs, and explicit framework steps demonstrates thorough understanding and satisfies the PASS standard."
