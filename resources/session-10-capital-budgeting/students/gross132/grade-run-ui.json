  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus at least one clear sensitivity analysis (NPV profile across discount rates) and illustrated breakpoints (8.2-year discounted payback and the IRR vs WACC intersection/margin of safety). DRIVER stages (Implement, Validate, Evolve) were used to produce and interpret these analyses, demonstrating a complete and conceptually thorough treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran the code and reported specific output values (NPV, IRR, PI, payback). They explained key assumptions (parameters, discounting, depreciation) and interpreted results against expectations (NPV>0 and IRR>WACC), demonstrating a thorough, aligned implementation and validation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrates what the charts show, including values, units (dollars, years, percentages), and scenarios (varying discount rates). They interpret both the J-curve (break-even at 8.2 years, end value ~$2.7M) and the NPV profile (IRR vs WACC, inverse relationship, margin of safety), which conveys capital allocation trade-offs. These descriptions align with Implement/Validate/Evolve stages, meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project capital budgeting for Starbucks and does not analyze capital structure choices or quantify tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs. It also does not reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The work is exclusively metric-based (NPV/IRR), so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It focuses solely on project evaluation (NPV/IRR/WACC) without capital structure analysis. Given the absence of leverage math or conceptual treatment, it fails this criterion despite completing DRIVER stages.",
