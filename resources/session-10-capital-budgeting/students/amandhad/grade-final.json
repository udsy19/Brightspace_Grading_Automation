  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explained and applied NPV: defined the decision rule, structured FCFs, implemented a custom NPV function that discounts cash flows (including t=0), and validated calculations with manual checks. They reported a base-case NPV and conducted sensitivity analyses, demonstrating strong conceptual and practical mastery consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the correct NPV decision rule and applies it to the base case and adverse scenarios, interpreting positive NPV as accept and negative NPV as reject. Custom implementation and scenario analysis demonstrate depth beyond a surface mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero and implements it via bisection, demonstrating sound computational understanding. They report IRR results for base and scenario cases and correctly note IRR’s independence from WACC, showing depth beyond a surface mention. The DRIVER stages used provide thorough, credible evidence of accurate IRR computation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly defined simple and discounted payback and applied them to the base case, reporting approximate recovery years. However, the treatment stays basic: results are approximate and slightly inconsistent (year 10 vs year 9), with no detailed cumulative schedule, fractional-year interpolation, or sensitivity discussion. This demonstrates understanding but not the thoroughness needed for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly implemented and validated the base case and a downside (20% revenue) scenario and tested WACC variations, demonstrating personal execution and ownership. However, they did not explicitly present a revenue-based best‑case (upside) scenario labelled as such, so the scenario‑modeling requirement (best/base/worst) is only partially satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed solid internal validation checks and explicitly compared project metrics (NPV, IRR) to the firm's 8.5% hurdle rate, fulfilling testing assumptions and hurdle comparison. However, they did not cite or use any external calculators, benchmarks, or third‑party sources to cross-check results, so per the category standard this meets validation partially rather than fully.",

Because the criterion asks for industry benchmark context and that is missing, the submission fails this criterion."

However, they do not justify or externally validate the $12M real estate/construction cost nor run sensitivity/contingency analysis on capex or construction risk, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
