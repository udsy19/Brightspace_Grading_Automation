  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue downside and WACC shifts), consolidates results into a sensitivity table/visuals, and explicitly highlights the breakpoint where a 20% revenue decline flips NPV negative and IRR below the hurdle—linking this to the approval recommendation. This treatment is thorough and actionable, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the model and presents numeric results, and describes multiple concrete validation checks (sign check, terminal tax, manual discounting) that confirm logic and outputs. Combined REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE stages provide thorough, specific evidence that the code was executed and its results were verified, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and specifically narrates what the visualizations show (FCF bar chart pattern, year-10 bump) and explains the sensitivity table’s scenarios and metrics, including units and scenario results. This verbal walkthrough clarifies capital allocation trade-offs (revenue vs WACC sensitivity) and satisfies the criterion at a thorough level under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off (debt tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. It focuses on a Starbucks project NPV with a depreciation tax shield, which is unrelated to the criterion’s scope.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No identification of who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, and no discussion of incentive misalignment. Absent any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Even under moderate standards, the criterion is not addressed beyond generic references to “shareholder/stakeholder value.”\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage (DFL), EPS/ROE volatility under different financing choices, or bankruptcy/coverage risk. While thorough on NPV/IRR and sensitivity to WACC and revenues, it omits leverage effects and risk metrics required by the criterion, so it fails under the moderate standard.",
