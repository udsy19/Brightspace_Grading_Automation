  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the Python model and that it worked, and they narrate validation checks (cash-flow completeness, tax/depreciation handling, terminal/NWC recovery) aligned with stated assumptions (e.g., WACC, straight-line depreciation). This is a thorough, conceptually clear verbal confirmation meeting the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Discover stage (problem, parameters, and objective) and states that mathematical definitions were completed \"before we write the code,\" with modeling described afterward. This satisfies the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a pre‑implementation visualization and stated planned models/metrics (cash‑flow model, NPV/IRR, sensitivity tests) and then implemented those elements in Python with verification of cash flows. Represent, Implement, and Validate evidence shows a systematic plan and linkage from plan to artifacts, meeting the moderate DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or quantify tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across payout or debt choices, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on project capital budgeting for Starbucks and a depreciation tax shield, which is unrelated to the required capital structure analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses shareholder-focused decision rules (hurdle rate, NPV/IRR) but does not analyze agency conflicts across stakeholders. It lacks identification of who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices and omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze financial leverage or DFL, provide EPS/ROE effects under different financing choices, or discuss bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Discussion centers on operating leverage and unlevered cash flows, leaving the core criterion unaddressed.",
