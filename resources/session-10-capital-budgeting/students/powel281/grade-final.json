  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student built a comprehensive cash-flow schedule (including initial outlay, annual FCFs, terminal value tax effects, and NWC recovery) and discounted them at 8.5% to arrive at NPV ≈ $2.69M. Despite a minor verbal sign slip in the formula description, the calculation, components, and sensitivity discussion show strong conceptual and applied mastery of NPV. Hence, PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid grasp of the NPV decision rule: using the 8.5% hurdle to assess value creation, accepting when NPV is positive in the base case, and rejecting under adverse scenarios (e.g., revenue −20%). Their sensitivity discussion and linkage of NPV to accept/reject decisions across discount rates and assumptions show thorough, conceptually accurate application consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid, applied understanding of free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusted for capital expenditures and working capital changes, including depreciation add-back, initial capex, NWC outflow/recovery, and terminal value with taxes. They mapped this into an annual cash flow schedule and validated construction of unlevered free cash flow. Minor wording inconsistencies do not undermine the thorough, correct treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes IRR as a key metric, attempts to compute it, and uses it in decision framing against the hurdle rate. However, the IRR value reported (“IR 2.84”) is unclear and likely inaccurate, and there is no demonstration or explanation that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero. Given the conceptual linkage but lack of clear, accurate computation and depth, this merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly reports a “payback of 28 years,” which is inconsistent with their own cash flow schedule (undiscounted recovery would occur around year 6, not 28). Although they reference implementing a payback metric, the inaccurate result shows a fundamental error in determining the time to recover the initial investment, failing this criterion under financial accuracy.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not define, discuss, or calculate the Profitability Index (present value of benefits divided by initial investment). Despite covering other metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) and building a cash flow model, there is no conceptual or computational treatment of PI in any DRIVER stage, so the criterion is not met.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents key cost assumptions (capex, NWC, depreciation method, taxes and operating cost items) and implements them in a model with sensitivity tests, showing partial validation. However, they do not justify or source the real estate/construction figures (e.g., origin of the $12M, rent/construction breakdown) and acknowledge reliance on external help, so treatment is correct but incomplete."
