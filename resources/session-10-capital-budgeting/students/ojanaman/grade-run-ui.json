  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue −20% and WACC variation) and explicitly identifies a breakpoint (~80% of revenue) where the project becomes unviable, with numeric implications for NPV/IRR. These concrete tests and the linkage to decision outcomes demonstrate a thorough, actionable sensitivity analysis meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms executing the notebook and running multiple validation checks, stating results matched expectations and describing how key assumptions (depreciation, revenue shocks, WACC) affected NPV/IRR. This demonstrates both running the code and verbally validating outputs with aligned logic, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documents the Define/Discover information up front (project, stakeholders/objectives, inputs and decision rules) before proceeding to representation and implementation of the model. This satisfies the strict requirement that D-stage be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission does not discuss, quantify, or compare the debt tax shield against expected financial distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Work is focused on a Starbucks project appraisal; only a depreciation tax shield is mentioned, which is not the criterion’s topic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR, sensitivity, and decision rules but does not discuss stakeholder incentive conflicts or identify winners/losers under different choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage/buybacks. Given the complete absence of this content, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or compute/interpret DFL. It lacks coverage of downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics under different debt policies. While DRIVER stages are present, they center on operating risk and hurdle-rate sensitivity, not financial leverage, so the criterion is not met.",
