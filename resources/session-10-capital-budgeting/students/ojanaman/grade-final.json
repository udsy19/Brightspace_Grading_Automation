  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed NPV using the stated discount rate, recognized the initial outlay as a large negative Year 0 cash flow, and incorporated comprehensive cash flow components. Validation and sensitivity discussion further demonstrate thorough, applied understanding of NPV, meeting the PASS standard for depth in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule, applies it to the base case using the specified hurdle rate, and discusses accept/reject implications under sensitivity scenarios. This shows a strong conceptual grasp of when to accept (NPV > 0) and when to reject (NPV turns negative), satisfying a thorough treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student determined the simple payback period clearly (year 6) and supported it with specific free cash flow figures, showing how cumulative recovery occurs. They also framed this within the DRIVER process (Represent → Implement → Reflect), demonstrating sound conceptual understanding consistent with a moderate evaluation standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR (13.25%) and applies the decision rule relative to WACC, showing basic conceptual understanding and application. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero, nor do they show or discuss the computation method or provide detailed supporting calculations. This is adequate for a basic demonstration but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and discussed a profitability metric (0.242 per dollar invested), showing conceptual understanding. However, they reported NPV per dollar rather than explicitly calculating the profitability index as PV of benefits divided by initial investment (which would be ~1.242) and did not provide a thorough explanation. Hence, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies free cash flow including operating cash flow components, capital expenditures, and working capital changes, and provides sample FCF outputs. However, the treatment is summary-level without detailed year-by-year operating cash flow derivation or explicit working capital change calculations beyond initial outlay and recovery.

      "reasoning": "The submission clearly lists numerical assumptions for real estate/construction (12M building, 500k WC, straight-line depreciation) and performs checks/sensitivities, showing partial validation. However, the student does not justify why those cost figures, working-capital size, terminal value, or depreciation choices were chosen (no market/comparable evidence or rationale), so documentation is correct but insufficiently justified."
