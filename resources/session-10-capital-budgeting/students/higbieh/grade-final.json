  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined NPV, described how time-zero is treated, and applied it to a detailed cash flow schedule to produce a specific NPV result and decision. Sensitivity discussion further shows understanding of how changes affect NPV. This depth across Represent and Implement (with validation) meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV accept/reject rule and applies it in both base-case acceptance and a revenue-down scenario leading to rejection, showing correct decision-making. They also tie the analysis to the DRIVER stages by implementing calculations and reflecting via sensitivity, demonstrating thorough understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly presented multiple equivalent formulations of OCF, including the EBIT(1−T)+Dep/NOPAT+Dep approach, and embedded OCF in the model’s cash flow schedule. They further verified the OCF with an alternative calculation and provided a numerical check (Year 1 OCF = 1.2), demonstrating depth beyond a surface mention. This satisfies a thorough, conceptually solid treatment under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied a base-case IRR and showed conceptual understanding, satisfying moderate standards. However, they acknowledged the IRR was only approximate and did not recompute IRR in sensitivities (“IRR would be the same”), revealing gaps in thoroughness. Thus, the treatment is correct but not comprehensive enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified both simple and discounted payback periods and conceptually described how discounted payback is computed, showing sound understanding. However, they did not thoroughly demonstrate the calculation (e.g., cumulative recovery by year) or interpret decision implications, so coverage is accurate but not in-depth enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the PI, decision rule, and provided a PI result, showing conceptual understanding and application across Represent and Implement. However, they did not explicitly show the calculation from PV of benefits and initial outlay, and labeled the ratio as a percent with inconsistent supporting numbers, limiting depth.
