  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WAC ±2%), quantifies NPV/IRR outcomes, and explicitly identifies the breakpoint where revenue decline flips the decision to reject. Depth of scenarios and interpretation meets the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the model and presents numeric outputs (NPV, IRR) and interprets them relative to assumptions. They also describe validation steps (peer comparison and year‑one EBT/OCF checks) demonstrating that outputs were checked against expectations, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly verbalizes what the tables show (line items, years, units in millions) and explains scenario outputs and their implications for NPV/IRR. Multiple scenarios are described with specific numbers, satisfying the requirement to explain units and scenarios and clarifying capital allocation trade-offs.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between interest tax shields and financial distress/flexibility costs, nor does it compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives or quantify their impacts. It is centered on a Starbucks project NPV analysis and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: There is no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under financing/payout options, or asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. The submission remains on project valuation mechanics and sensitivity, so this criterion is not demonstrated even at a conceptual level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR, WACC, and revenue sensitivity but does not discuss leverage math (DFL), how debt affects EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the absence of capital structure/leverage analysis, the criterion is not demonstrated despite sound DRIVER process on other topics.",
