  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined NPV, applied the 8.5% WACC to a constructed cash flow schedule, and reported a specific positive NPV (~$3M) with decision implications. Sensitivity analysis further demonstrated depth by showing NPV turning negative under a 20% revenue drop and responding to WACC changes. This reflects thorough, accurate treatment aligned with multiple DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV and applies the accept/reject rule (accept when NPV > 0; reject when NPV < 0) across base and sensitivity scenarios, linking positive NPV to value creation. Multiple applications (base case and revenue/WACC sensitivities) and an explicit recommendation demonstrate a strong, thorough grasp adequate for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting via Python, generating a full cash flow schedule and computing core metrics (NPV, IRR, payback, PI), plus automated sensitivity analyses and visualizations. This demonstrates thorough integration of technology with finance across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages, satisfying a knowledgeable reviewer's expectations despite minor inconsistencies.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and claims to compute it, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the reported IRR is inconsistently stated (0.13% yet “much higher” than 8.5%), indicating accuracy issues in interpretation/presentation. Given the moderate standard, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines payback and provides base (≈5–5.28 years) and sensitivity (9.39 years) results, indicating applied understanding. However, the explanation that year-10’s higher cash flow is “because we are finally getting the payback” is inaccurate and contradicts the earlier 5-year payback, revealing conceptual gaps. Thus, understanding is present but not thorough, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly interprets PI as value per dollar invested and reports a computed PI of 1.24, applying it in the decision, which demonstrates conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly define PI as the present value of benefits divided by initial investment or show the calculation details, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly defines the problem, objectives, and inputs; Implement — describes building/running the cash‑flow and metrics code; Reflect (and Validate/Evolve) — interprets results, runs sensitivity tests, and gives a recommendation with risks.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides clear, correct explanations of key financial concepts, constructs and runs the cash‑flow/metric implementation, and interprets base and sensitivity results to support a recommendation. Coverage is comprehensive—definitions, calculations, sensitivity analysis, and risk-aware recommendation—meeting the threshold for thorough communication under the DRIVER stages."
