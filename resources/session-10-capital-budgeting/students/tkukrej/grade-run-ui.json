  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), reported numerical outcomes (NPV turning negative, payback increasing to ~9.39 years) and identified the clear breakpoint where recommendation flips (revenue -20%). That meets the criterion fully and demonstrates thorough, applied sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the code and presents validation steps (depreciation/tax checks and sensitivity analyses) with concrete outcomes. They verbally tie assumptions (revenue shock, WACC changes) to observed results (NPV/IRR/payback), meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Define & Discover stage (problem statement, parameters, and objectives) before moving to modeling (\"In the code...\"). That meets the strict requirement for an up-front D-stage, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure trade-offs, payout alternatives, or Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Tax is only treated within project cash flows (not debt tax shields), and there is no quantification of distress or flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify stakeholder winners/losers or divergent incentives, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting linked to leverage or buybacks. Aside from a brief mention of “shareholder value,” there is no agency-conflict analysis, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, provide DFL math, or address bankruptcy/coverage metrics. It focuses on project valuation (NPV/IRR, payback) and WACC sensitivity only. Given the absence of leverage analysis, this criterion is not demonstrated.",
