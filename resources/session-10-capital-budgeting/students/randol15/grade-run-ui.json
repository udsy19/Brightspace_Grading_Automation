  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numeric NPVs for each, and explicitly noted that a 20% revenue decline flips NPV negative—identifying a clear breakpoint that would change stakeholder preference. Implementation and validation evidence support that the sensitivity analysis was executed and interpreted.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and that it finished, reports computed outputs, and describes validation checks and CSV verification that confirm outputs behave consistently with assumed parameter changes. They also discuss key assumptions and limitations, so the verbal confirmation and matching logic meet the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript clearly documents a Discover stage (problem, objectives, key concepts, assumptions) before stating the Represent/modeling step, meeting the requirement for explicit up‑front D-stage. Therefore the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback, dividend, or debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. It only references a generic financing assumption and WACC, plus depreciation tax shields, which are unrelated to interest tax shields and capital return choices required by the criterion. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission lacks any discussion of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and it does not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the moderate standard, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but it is missing; thus the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address degree of financial leverage (DFL) or how financing choice affects EPS/ROE volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Aside from a brief note about cheaper debt and WACC, there is no conceptual or quantitative leverage analysis, which does not meet even a basic treatment for this criterion.",
