  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates the NPV decision rule by linking positive NPV to value creation and an accept decision, while acknowledging that negative NPV under sensitivity indicates risk. They apply the rule across scenarios and explicitly base their recommendation on a positive NPV and PI>1, showing thorough, conceptually sound understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined both payback period methods, computed base-case values, and analyzed sensitivity (WACC changes and revenue downside) including the case where discounted payback is not achieved. Despite minor unit wording issues, the treatment is thorough and demonstrates strong conceptual understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined the PI formula, implemented a calculation within their model, produced a numeric PI (~1.24), and used it appropriately for ranking and acceptance decisions. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with moderate strictness standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual understanding of NPV (discount future cash flows at WACC and compare to the initial outlay) and applies it in a model with scenario analysis. However, inconsistent and erroneous figures (initial investment stated as both 1,200 million and 12 million; unit issues like “Year two 270 million”) undermine calculation accuracy. Given moderate strictness, this supports a correct but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported IRR values across scenarios and recognized IRR as a root-finding problem, correctly noting IRR should exceed WACC when NPV is positive. However, the treatment is not thorough: the definition (discount rate making NPV=0) isn’t clearly articulated, results are inconsistently presented, and the computation method is only vaguely referenced. Hence, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL, not PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual understanding by acknowledging capex, depreciation tax shield, and working capital investment/recovery—core elements of free cash flow. However, they do not explicitly articulate FCF as operating cash flow less capex and changes in working capital, and the reported cash flow figures are inconsistent, indicating gaps in thoroughness. Thus, coverage is correct but basic, warranting a partial pass.",
