  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly and accurately calculated NPV by constructing free cash flows including the Year 0 outlay, discounting them at the 8.5% WACC, and reporting a specific NPV. They further demonstrated understanding through implementation details and sensitivity analysis, satisfying a comprehensive, conceptually solid treatment under the DRIVER framework.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule (positive NPV ⇒ accept) and tests it across multiple scenarios, noting when NPV turns negative and when the decision remains accept. They integrate these results into a final recommendation, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding aligned with DRIVER stages (Validate, Evolve, Reflect).\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: PASS because the student accurately defines IRR, implements a method to compute it, and reports a concrete IRR (12.84%) used in decision-making. They also interpret IRR relative to WACC and across scenarios, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding within the DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both terminal value and working capital recovery in Year 10 and integrates them through Represent, Implement, and Validate. However, they do not address the after-tax treatment of terminal/salvage proceeds or their relation to book value, implying potential omission of taxes on salvage. This is a correct but basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed internal validation and compared IRR to the WACC and ran WACC sensitivity, showing understanding of the investment hurdle. However, they did not cite any external sources or tools (e.g., calculators, published benchmarks) as required for a full PASS, so the validation is general/internal and thus scores PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly identifies and consistently uses 8.5% as the WACC and treats it conceptually as the hurdle rate, including sensitivity analysis showing its impact. However, they do not justify or derive why 8.5% is appropriate for Starbucks (no source or decomposition of WACC), so the treatment is correct and applied but not thoroughly defended, meriting PARTIAL.",

However, they do not justify why $12M (or the $0.5M working capital) is appropriate nor validate those cost assumptions against external data or sensitivity analysis on capex, so treatment is correct but incomplete."
