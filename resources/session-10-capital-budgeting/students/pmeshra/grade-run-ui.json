  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reports numeric outcomes for each, and explicitly identifies the breakpoint where a 20% revenue miss flips NPV negative and thus the accept/reject decision. This is a thorough, clear treatment of scenario and sensitivity analysis, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running code in Colab, describes the implemented functions and parameters, and reports specific printed outputs. They also verbally validate those outputs against stated assumptions and finance intuition and run scenario tests, satisfying thorough confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly narrates what the tables and charts show, specifying units (millions, dollars, years) and clearly explaining scenarios (base, revenue -20%, WACC 6.5%/10.5%). Descriptions of both the FCF schedule and the NPV sensitivity chart demonstrate comprehensive, accurate interpretation aligned with DRIVER’s Validate and Evolve stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not quantify interest tax shield benefits or expected distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Content is limited to a Starbucks capital budgeting analysis; the only “tax shield” mentioned is depreciation, not leverage-related.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project NPV/IRR and shareholder value without discussing divergent stakeholder incentives, who gains/loses, or agency issues. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage and buybacks. Given the absence of required concepts across the DRIVER stages, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - No discussion or math on degree of financial leverage (DFL), nor how debt vs equity would change EPS/ROE volatility or downside risk. No mention of interest, coverage ratios, or bankruptcy risk when altering debt levels. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is absent; hence FAIL.",
