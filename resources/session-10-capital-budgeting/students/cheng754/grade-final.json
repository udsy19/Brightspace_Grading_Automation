  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct and thorough NPV application: defining the hurdle rate, constructing appropriate free cash flows, incorporating initial investment and terminal/working capital effects, computing NPV in code, and discussing sensitivity and results ($2.5M positive NPV). Multiple DRIVER stages reinforce a comprehensive, conceptually sound treatment suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and correctly defined unlevered FCF and explicitly included operating cash flow components, capex, and working capital changes, then implemented and validated them in a model. The discussion covers mechanics (depreciation add-back, taxes, ΔWC, capex) and application (year 0 outflow, year 10 recovery), meeting a thorough standard for this moderate criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student comprehensively identified project-only cash flows: initial capex and working capital, unlevered operating cash flows with tax and depreciation adjustments, tax shields, and terminal value plus WC recovery, while avoiding financing flows. Implementation and validation steps explicitly confirm the correct treatment of bookend incremental cash flows, meeting the criterion at a thorough level under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by linking a positive NPV at the chosen hurdle rate to an accept recommendation and reinforces with sensitivity checks. However, treatment is basic: they don’t explicitly articulate the general accept/reject rule (NPV > 0 accept; NPV < 0 reject, NPV = 0 indifferent) or explore counter-cases in depth. Hence, solid but not thorough, yielding a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, comparing it to the hurdle rate, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate the computation beyond reliance on a library, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly mentions calculating the payback period and references cash flow timing, showing basic understanding. However, they do not report the payback time, clarify method (simple vs discounted), or interpret its implications. Under a moderate standard, this is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",
