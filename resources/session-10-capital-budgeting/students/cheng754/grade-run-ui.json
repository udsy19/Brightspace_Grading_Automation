  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the code and that it produced expected metrics, cites specific output checks (year 0 and year 10) and affirms the math, and also clearly explains the modelling assumptions and logic that lead to those results. This meets the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the visuals show (cash flow table’s year 0 outflow and year 10 spike) and interprets a bar chart, including scenarios (revenue -20%, WACC 6.5–10.5%) and outcome direction (NPV positive, breakeven context). This provides sufficient detail and multiple examples to clarify trade-offs relevant to stakeholders (shareholder value, risk), satisfying a thorough, moderate-standard pass.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Define/Discover stage up front with objective and key parameters before describing representation and implementation. The sequence (\"starting with define and discover\" → parameters → \"moving to representing...\") meets the strict requirement that D-stage be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs or quantify debt tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction. It is a project-level capital budgeting analysis for Starbucks, not Apple, and contains no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk. Even with moderate strictness, the required concept is missing, so the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts across stakeholders, nor identify who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits discussion of asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Even under moderate strictness, only a shareholder-centric view and operational notes are provided, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses leverage math (DFL) or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. The work focuses on unlevered FCF, NPV/IRR, and revenue/discount-rate sensitivities, which do not satisfy this criterion.",
