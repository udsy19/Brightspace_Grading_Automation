  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), reported numeric outcomes (NPV negative, IRR falling) and explicitly identified that a 20% revenue drop flips the project from acceptable to unacceptable, and explained WACC effects. This demonstrates a thorough, actionable sensitivity analysis and highlights the breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, walked through implementation details, and performed manual Excel checks comparing EBIT, taxes, depreciation, free cash flow, and discounted cash flows, confirming outputs and correcting a minor mistake. Their verbal validation and clear statement of key assumptions demonstrate thorough confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly narrates what the tables/outputs show, cites specific figures with units (millions, percentages), and explains multiple scenarios (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%) and their effects. This clearly describes visual results and scenarios, meeting the criterion at a comprehensive level under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project valuation for Starbucks, not capital structure trade-offs, and does not analyze buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. While taxes and depreciation are mentioned, there is no quantification of interest tax shields, distress or optionality costs, nor any linkage to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different financing/payout options. It also does not address asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the absence of these required elements, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk, nor does it use coverage metrics; it focuses solely on project appraisal (NPV/IRR/payback) and sensitivity to revenue/WACC. Given the criterion requires discussing how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and risk, the absence of leverage math or risk metrics results in a FAIL despite a solid capital budgeting analysis.",
