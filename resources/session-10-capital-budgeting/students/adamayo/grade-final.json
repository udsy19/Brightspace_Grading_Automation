  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV: identified and discounted future cash flows at WACC, included year-0 outlay and working-capital timing, validated discounting with an explicit calculation, and reported/interpreted NPV across base and sensitivity cases. This demonstrates strong conceptual and applied understanding beyond a basic mention, meeting a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulated and applied the NPV decision rule: positive NPV → accept, negative NPV → reject, and tied this to their decision. They reinforced this with sensitivity analysis showing how a negative NPV under revenue stress would reverse the decision. This demonstrates thorough, conceptually solid treatment appropriate for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero, computes and reports IRR (12.5%) from the model, compares it to WACC for decision-making, and explores IRR behavior under sensitivity (-20% revenue). This shows a strong, applied understanding beyond basics, satisfying the moderate standard for thoroughness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes working capital recovery (outflow at t=0, inflow at year 10) and conceptually addresses terminal value with salvage sold at book (no tax), and includes salvage in the depreciation base. However, they do not thoroughly demonstrate or verify the explicit inclusion of terminal salvage proceeds and WC recovery in the terminal-year cash flow, leaving the treatment at a basic conceptual level rather than a detailed, confirmed application. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student correctly conducted and discussed sensitivity of NPV to key drivers (revenue, WACC) and interpreted implications, showing conceptual understanding. However, there is no clear visualization (e.g., charts/tornado/table) of NPV sensitivity, and coverage is limited to a few scenarios, so treatment is basic rather than thorough.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student clearly presents detailed quantitative analysis (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity with numeric outcomes) but the strategic discussion, while present, is high-level and not deeply developed or quantified. That balance demonstrates correct understanding but is not sufficiently thorough on the strategic side to merit a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly listed and implemented several core assumptions (tax rate, COGS, depreciation/salvage, working capital) and validated calculations, showing understanding and correction of an error. However, several parameter choices (e.g., why COGS = 40%, salvage = $3M) lack explicit justification, and some real estate/construction cost choices are not deeply defended, so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly justified."

Implement — described the AI/code implementation, step‑by‑step cash‑flow calculations and validation checks.

Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows depth and comprehensive communication consistent with a PASS."
