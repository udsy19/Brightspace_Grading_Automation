  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports outputs \"generated by the code\" (NPV, IRR, payback) and describes the methods used to compute and validate them (discounting, numpy_financial, scenario multipliers). Their verbal explanation ties key assumptions (depreciation, taxes, terminal value, parameterization) to the reported results, demonstrating execution and validation of the code.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and specifically narrates what the charts show, including scenarios (Revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), units (dollars, years, percent), and outcomes (breakeven timing, NPV direction). This thorough verbal walk-through of multiple visuals meets the moderate standard and demonstrates strong grasp of how visuals clarify trade-offs for capital budgeting.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states and documents the Define/Discover stage (problem, goal, scope) before describing representation and then implementation of the model. This meets the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off among buybacks, dividends, and debt reduction, nor quantify interest tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Mentioning a depreciation tax shield reflects operating accounting, not capital structure.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts across stakeholders or identify who gains/loses under differing financing or operating choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage and buybacks. Even under moderate standards, there is no conceptual treatment of the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice or financial leverage affects ROE/EPS volatility, DFL, downside risk, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. It remains at an unlevered capital budgeting analysis (WACC, NPV/IRR) without any leverage math or discussion of interest coverage/DSCR, so it fails this criterion.",
