  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately explains NPV as discounting future free cash flows using WACC and incorporates the initial outlay via a Year 0 cash flow, demonstrating correct methodology. They thoroughly model key cash flow components (tax shield, after-tax salvage, WC recovery) and provide base-case NPV plus sensitivity to revenue and WACC, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes having written and run a cash-flow function with block-level detail (depreciation, EBIT, taxes, add-back, terminal value) and reports concrete NPV/IRR results. They also state the precise validation methods (WACC discounting and numpy_financial IRR), demonstrating personal execution, ownership, and sufficient technical understanding required by the strict standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly parameterized inputs, described each cash-flow computation step (depreciation, operating cash flow, terminal value, working-capital recovery), and reported model outputs and scenario checks, showing personal implementation and verification. This meets the strict technical-implementation requirements for accurate cash-flow projections over the project life.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the NPV decision rule by linking a positive NPV to value creation and an accept decision, and acknowledged the implication of potentially negative NPV in sensitivity. However, they did not explicitly articulate the full accept/reject rule (e.g., accept if NPV ≥ 0, reject if NPV < 0) or provide a comprehensive discussion of boundary cases, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and computes IRR and interprets it relative to the hurdle rate, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: only a single IRR result is reported and sensitivity/diagnostics focus on NPV rather than IRR, with no deeper discussion (e.g., cash flow sign issues or multiple IRRs). This supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and computed the simple payback period, provided an approximate result, and supported it with a breakeven chart, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth (no cumulative schedule, no discounted payback, and no scenario-specific payback analysis), so it is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.",
