  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly calculated NPV from a well-defined free cash flow schedule, applied the correct discount rate, reported specific NPV figures, and examined NPV sensitivity to WACC and revenues. The treatment is thorough and accurate overall, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding across Represent, Implement, and Validate/Evolve stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV decision rule and applies it across base and sensitivity scenarios, then explicitly bases the final accept recommendation on positive NPV. The treatment is thorough, with multiple applications (base, revenue sensitivity, WACC sensitivity) demonstrating strong conceptual grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately computed and interpreted both simple and discounted payback periods, provided specific values, and tied them to decision criteria. The Implement and Represent stages show the mechanics behind the calculation, and the Define/Discover stage shows its role in evaluation. This demonstrates a thorough and accurate treatment suitable for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR in the base case and a sensitivity scenario, showing functional understanding and usage within their model. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or connect it to the NPV–discount rate crossover, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, the criterion is met at a satisfactory but not comprehensive level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and interprets the profitability index (reports ~1.24) and explains its meaning as PV of returns per dollar invested, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: no explicit formula or calculation steps, no sensitivity or deeper discussion, and repeated misnaming as “probability index” reduces accuracy. Thus, it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly builds project free cash flows using capex, working capital investment and recovery, depreciation tax shield, and terminal value, and implicitly excludes financing flows by working from EBIT. However, they do not explicitly address excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead), opportunity costs, or cannibalization effects.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented key assumptions (capex, depreciation schedule, working capital, cost structure, tax rate, terminal value) and validated their implementation through model checks and sensitivity analysis. However, justification for some specific choices (e.g., origin or rationale for the $3M terminal value and $500k working capital beyond \"assignment gives us\") is limited, so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough."
