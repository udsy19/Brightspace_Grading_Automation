  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC shifts), quantified outcomes (NPV/IRR) and explicitly identified the breakpoint where the project becomes value-destructive under a ~20% revenue shortfall. DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) are evidenced and used to support the sensitivity analysis and its implications, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms executing the Collab notebook and that cells ran successfully, reusing functions for scenario runs. They also verbally validate outputs against assumptions (cash flows, depreciation, tax treatment) and note internal consistency of KPIs, satisfying both execution confirmation and logical validation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly verbalized what the visuals show, naming axes, units (years, dollars, percentages), and scenarios, and interpreting results. They used multiple visuals (FCF bars; NPV vs WACC curve) and sensitivity cases to clarify capital allocation trade-offs and shareholder impact, meeting the criterion at a comprehensive level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission performs project-level NPV/IRR analysis for Starbucks and mentions taxes and WACC, but does not evaluate the capital structure trade-off, quantify tax shield benefits, or weigh expected financial distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. It focuses entirely on NPV/IRR and sensitivity for shareholders. Under moderate standards, the required concepts are missing, so this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice impacts ROE/EPS volatility. There is no leverage math (DFL/EPS/ROE), nor discussion of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics; the analysis remains unlevered and limited to WACC sensitivity.
