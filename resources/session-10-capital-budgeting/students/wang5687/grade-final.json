  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and applied NPV by constructing year-by-year FCFs, including the initial investment, discounting at 8.5%, and reporting a numeric NPV. They demonstrated depth through validation and sensitivity analyses that show how NPV changes with revenues and discount rates, and reflected accurately on NPV’s meaning. This goes beyond basic mention and satisfies a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV accept/reject rule, applies it to a computed positive base-case NPV, and analyzes a scenario where NPV turns negative, implying rejection. Reflection emphasizes NPV as the primary decision metric. This depth across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages satisfies a thorough, conceptually strong treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero, computed a concrete IRR (30.25%), and applied it in scenario interpretation relative to WACC. Their reflection on IRR’s limitations with non-conventional cash flows shows solid conceptual depth beyond basic calculation, satisfying a thorough treatment under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported a PI and applied the correct decision rule, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly present the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or detail the components used, limiting depth. This meets a correct but basic standard, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key incremental cash flow components (initial investment, OCFs, working capital investment/recovery, terminal value) and operationalizes them in the model. However, treatment is basic and lacks thorough discussion of excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, financing flows, cannibalization/opportunity costs) or multiple detailed examples. Hence, solid but not comprehensive, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding that OCF derives from EBIT and that depreciation is a non-cash item creating a tax shield, but they do not explicitly state or thoroughly work through OCF = EBIT × (1 − T) + Depreciation with detailed steps or examples. Given moderate strictness, this is accurate but basic coverage, warranting a PARTIAL.",
