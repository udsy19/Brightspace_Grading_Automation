  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported quantitative outcomes, and explicitly identified a breakpoint (revenue -20% makes NPV negative and flips the accept/reject decision). The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) are evident and support a thorough, applied sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code, printing results, and gives numeric outputs (NPV/IRR/payback/PI and cash‑flow components). They also articulate validation checks and how assumptions (revenues, WACC) explain the results, meeting the criterion for verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly described the tables/plots, stated units (millions), and verbally interpreted scenario-based visual outputs (NPV patterns with revenue and W changes), explaining trade-offs in capital allocation. Their Implement and Evolve stages provide thorough, scenario-driven descriptions meeting the criterion at a PASS level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt alternatives, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Content focuses on project evaluation for Starbucks, with only a generic note on depreciation tax effects, which is unrelated to the required Apple capital structure analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting linked to leverage or buybacks. Given this criterion requires at least conceptual coverage, the absence of any relevant content results in a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on capital budgeting (NPV/IRR/payback) and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, with no discussion or calculations of financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage ratios. Given the absence of these required elements, it fails this criterion.",
