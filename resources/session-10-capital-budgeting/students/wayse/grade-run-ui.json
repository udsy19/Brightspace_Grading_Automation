  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios, reports quantitative impacts (NPV/IRR) for each, and explicitly shows that a 20% revenue shortfall flips the decision from Accept to Reject. The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) provide both the planned tests and their executed interpretation, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission explicitly states the model was implemented and executed in Python and that sensitivity tests and rule-based validations were run, producing numeric outputs. The student also detected and explained a concrete coding/logic error (payback calculation) and adjusted the interpretation, demonstrating active validation and alignment between assumptions, logic, and results.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes what the tables show (acceptance based on NPV/IRR/PI) and explicitly explains units and scenario changes (e.g., $M, %, 200 bps, -20% revenue) while interpreting their impacts. Multiple scenarios are verbally summarized, satisfying a thorough, conceptually clear narration of visual outputs under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion is not addressed: there is no analysis of the debt tax shield versus financial distress/flexibility costs across capital allocation options, nor any connection to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. The work focuses on Starbucks project-level capital budgeting metrics; even the tax shield mention is depreciation-related, not capital structure. Under the moderate standard, basic conceptual discussion would earn partial, but this topic is effectively missing, warranting a fail.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The evidence shows a shareholder-only lens centered on NPV/IRR without any stakeholder incentive analysis, so this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage or DFL, nor how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It focuses on operating leverage and WACC sensitivity, with no coverage metrics or bankruptcy risk analysis, which is insufficient even for a moderate standard.",
