  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV, builds FCF components including initial outlay, working capital timing, and after-tax terminal value, and explicitly applies WACC to discount cash flows. They provide a computed NPV and sensitivity outcomes, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery aligned with multiple DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0 using the WACC) and applies it consistently across base and sensitivity scenarios, including rejecting when NPV is negative. Multiple stages (Discover, Implement, Validate) show thorough, correct application, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp and comprehensive treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined FCF as OCF minus capital expenditures and changes in working capital, and explicitly addressed timing and tax treatment for WC and terminal value. Their Represent and Implement stages show clear application of the formula within a cash flow model, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, presented base and scenario results, and showed awareness that IRR is independent of WACC. However, they did not explicitly define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or verify NPV≈0 at the reported IRRs, limiting depth. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows solid conceptual understanding by planning for both simple and discounted payback, computing them, and then diagnosing and correcting the logic error with a reasonable estimate and rationale. However, the Implement stage includes incorrect reported payback values and no finalized corrected discounted payback, leaving gaps in accuracy and completeness. Therefore, the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes PI, applies the acceptance threshold, and recognizes initial outlay composition, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they neither define the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) nor demonstrate its calculation, and the reported PI (1.347) appears inconsistent with the stated NPV and initial outlay, indicating accuracy gaps.

However, they did not cite or compare the project's returns to external industry benchmarks for retail locations (typical IRRs, cap rates, or sector return expectations), so treatment of \"industry benchmark returns for retail locations\" is incomplete."
