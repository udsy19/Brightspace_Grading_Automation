  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructs the NPV framework: explicit initial outflow, operating cash flows, terminal value and working capital recovery, and applies WACC to compute a concrete NPV (3.023M) with sensitivity analysis. Their DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages show strong conceptual grasp and application of NPV as present value of future cash flows net of the initial investment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule (accept when NPV > 0) and supports it with base-case results and downside sensitivity where NPV turns negative. They further demonstrate depth by discussing the NPV=0 break-even threshold and sensitivity to discount rate, showing strong conceptual grasp across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states treatment of depreciation (straight-line) and that tax rate is an input used in the operating cash flow calculation, and they ran and validated the code outputs for specific years. That demonstrates personal execution, block-level understanding of how depreciation and taxes feed into OCF/FCF, and ownership of verification, meeting the strict criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported IRR and used it to make an accept/reject decision, and explored discount-rate sensitivity, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly define IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or discuss how it is computed, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Thus, this meets a correct but not comprehensive standard, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions payback period as a metric but provides no calculation, value, or conceptual explanation of how the payback period is determined or why it matters. Implementation and reflection focus solely on NPV and IRR, with payback only name-checked. Under the moderate standard, a basic conceptual discussion would suffice; since that is missing, the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions the profitability index but neither defines it as PV of benefits divided by initial investment nor computes or interprets it. Under moderate strictness, mere mention without calculation or explanation is insufficient; the provided outputs and reflections focus only on NPV and IRR.",

      "reasoning": "The submission consistently uses Starbucks' WACC (8.5%) as the comparison benchmark and reports project IRR/NPV, but it contains no discussion or comparison to industry benchmark returns for retail locations. Because the criterion specifically asks for industry benchmark returns and that topic is missing, the work fails this criterion."

      "reasoning": "The student documents core assumptions and cost components clearly (investment amount, working capital, WACC, cost line items) but largely relies on assignment defaults and numeric checks rather than justifying or validating the real estate/construction cost choices. Because the submission lists assumptions and tests sensitivity but lacks deeper justification or external validation of the construction/real-estate cost figures, it meets a correct but incomplete treatment."
