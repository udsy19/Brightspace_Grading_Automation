  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (WACC ±2% and revenue −20%), and shows that the revenue drop flips NPV from +3.023M to −2.753M, evidencing a stakeholder preference shift (accept → reject). They also propose break-even and Monte Carlo extensions, demonstrating a strong, conceptually thorough treatment of scenario and sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code, shows outputs (inputs, cash flow table, NPV/IRR), and describes a concrete validation procedure (recomputing year 2 and year 10 with ChatGPT and comparing results). They also explain how key assumptions feed into results, demonstrating both execution and logical consistency—meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables show (cash flow table, NPV/IRR), cites specific units (millions, percentages), and explains scenarios (base, WACC ±2%, revenue −20%) while linking to an accept/reject decision for shareholder value. This constitutes a thorough verbal description of visual outputs and scenarios, meeting the moderate standard for integration of finance and technology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, and it does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. It focuses solely on Starbucks project NPV/IRR and sensitivities. Under the moderate standard, conceptual treatment would suffice, but it is entirely missing here.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it address risk-shifting/asset substitution tied to leverage or buybacks. It stays purely on NPV/IRR and sensitivity, providing no conceptual treatment of the specified criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity financing affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the moderate standard, at least a conceptual treatment was needed; none is present, so this criterion fails.",
