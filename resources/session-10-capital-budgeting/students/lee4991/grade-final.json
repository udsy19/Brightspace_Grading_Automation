  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule—accept if NPV > 0—anchored to the stated WACC and reinforced with sensitivity discussion showing NPV remains positive. Despite a minor contradictory slip elsewhere, the overall treatment is thorough and accurate, demonstrating strong conceptual understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines FCF as operating cash flow less capex and changes in working capital and correctly specifies OCF as after-tax EBIT plus depreciation, also recognizing WC recovery in the terminal year. Despite some numerical inconsistencies elsewhere, the treatment of the FCF construction is conceptually thorough and applied within an FCF schedule, meeting the criterion at a PASS level.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting calculations by using AI-assisted Python code, describing implemented formulas (depreciation, EBIT, OCF, FCF, NPV) and generating metrics and visuals. The parameterized, reusable model and scenario testing show comprehensive, technology-enabled automation beyond basic discussion, meeting the moderate standard for a full PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates conceptual understanding of NPV (discounting FCFs at WACC, inclusion of working capital and terminal value, and applying the NPV>0 decision rule). However, there are notable inaccuracies and inconsistencies (e.g., conflicting initial outlay figures and contradictory NPV results/formula phrasing) that reduce accuracy and thoroughness. Given the moderate standard, this merits a Partial rather than a Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and used IRR (19.31%) and correctly compared it to the 8.5% WACC, indicating basic conceptual understanding, and cited an implementation approach. However, they did not articulate IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or verify it via an NPV=0 check, and presented an inconsistent sensitivity case (positive NPV at 8.5% with IRR 4.88%). Thus, coverage is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains payback and discounted payback, provides both values (≈4.05 years and ≈5.17 years), and interprets them relative to project life, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is not thorough: there’s no calculation detail/cumulative cash flow demonstration and minor inconsistencies/typos (e.g., “discounted payback period is 7,” conflicting initial outlay figures), so it falls short of a PASS.",
