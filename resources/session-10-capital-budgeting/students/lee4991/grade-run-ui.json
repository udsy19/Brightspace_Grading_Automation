  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they created and used Python code and refers to the code outputs (\"m code values will show\"), and they describe running sensitivity scenarios as the validation step (testing cost-of-capital shocks). Those statements together demonstrate verbal confirmation of execution and that outputs were checked against expected behavior, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly described what each visualization shows, referenced the time units (years 0–10), and articulated specific scenarios (WACC shifts, 20% revenue drop) with resulting impacts. They also connected the sensitivity visuals to managerial focus, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level consistent with the DRIVER Implement and Evolve stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student ran and explained multiple sensitivities (discount rate and revenue/FCF variability) and described their impact on NPV/IRR and the project’s risk profile, including where management should focus mitigation. Using a coded model and scenario analysis shows solid integration of finance and technology, satisfying the criterion at a thorough, conceptually strong level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off between debt tax shields and financial distress/flexibility costs, nor does it compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives or connect to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The only “tax shield” discussed is depreciation at the project level, which is not the required capital structure tax benefit analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identify who gains/loses under alternative financing/actions. It also omits discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite solid DRIVER execution on valuation, the criterion is missing, warranting a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project valuation (NPV, IRR, payback) and WACC sensitivity, but does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choices affect ROE/EPS volatility. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the criterion requires leverage math and risk implications, the treatment is missing, warranting a FAIL.",
