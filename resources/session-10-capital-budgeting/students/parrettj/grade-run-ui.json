  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a Discover stage up front (goal, objectives, and detailed input parameters) and then states transition to Represent before building the model. This clear, chronological articulation meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated the objective, selected metrics (NPV, IRR), and listed required data before modeling, then explicitly mapped that plan into building the cash-flow model and running scenarios. Evidence shows a clear plan in Represent and a direct linkage to implemented artifacts in Implement and Validate, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic implementation: they built the cash-flow model tied to the Represent plan, produced concrete outputs (NPV/IRR) for base and sensitivity scenarios, and documented an iterative fix during execution. These elements meet the moderate standard for a PASS on methodological execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs for buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, or connect conclusions to Apple’s risk profile. Mentioning a tax rate and WACC within a project NPV context is insufficient and off-topic relative to the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - There is no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor of asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. The submission focuses solely on capital budgeting metrics (NPV/IRR) and sensitivities, which does not meet the criterion even under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Focus remained on NPV/IRR and WACC sensitivity, and EBIT was misdefined without linking interest or leverage. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
