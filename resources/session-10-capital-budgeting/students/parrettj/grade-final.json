You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly stated the investment question, defined NPV and IRR, listed critical assumptions/inputs, and described a plan to build cash flows and apply decision rules (IRR > WACC). These explicit statements satisfy the Define & Discover requirement under the strict DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows basic conceptual understanding and application of NPV with scenario and WACC sensitivity, but offers an imprecise definition (omits discounting) and presents contradictory results (earlier positive NPVs vs later “negative in all scenarios”), without clearly showing present value calculations or netting against initial investment. This supports a correct-but-incomplete treatment consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule to reject the project when NPV is negative and references this across scenarios, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not clearly articulate the full rule (accept if NPV > 0) and present contradictory NPV results while concluding rejection, indicating gaps and inconsistency. Hence, the treatment is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and reports IRR values for base and sensitivity scenarios, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the treatment is basic: no computation method is discussed, and there are minor inconsistencies/confusions in the analysis, falling short of a thorough, detailed treatment required for a PASS.",
