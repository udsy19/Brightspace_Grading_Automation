  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains NPV as the sum of discounted future cash flows and explicitly includes the initial investment at year 0, then implements the calculation in code and uses the result for decision-making. Inclusion of WACC-based discounting and year-0 outlay shows correct application, meeting the criterion with sufficient depth for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV rule, defines NPV, and applies the decision rule to computed results, concluding acceptance when NPV is positive. They further reinforce understanding by testing sensitivities while maintaining the accept decision. This demonstrates a thorough, applied grasp suitable for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined and executed sensitivity tests (WACC ±2% and revenue -20%), ran the code in Colab, reported numeric outcomes, and described the methods/functions used. This shows concrete, owned sensitivity analysis on key assumptions consistent with the DRIVER stages, satisfying the strict evidence requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and reports a computed IRR, comparing it to WACC, demonstrating conceptual understanding and application. However, the treatment is brief and relies on a black-box function without showing validation (e.g., NPV=0 at reported IRR), methodological details, or deeper discussion, so it falls short of a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes both simple and discounted payback and claims they were included in the analysis, demonstrating basic conceptual awareness. However, they provide no payback period values, no explanation of how it was determined, and offer an ambiguous statement about which version applies. This shows correct but superficial treatment, meriting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the PI formula and notes it was computed, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not present a PI value, show its calculation, or discuss its interpretation, falling short of the thorough treatment required for a PASS.",
