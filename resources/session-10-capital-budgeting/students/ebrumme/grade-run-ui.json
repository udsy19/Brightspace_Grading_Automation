  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code (\"did my code in collab\"), describes the formulas and functions used (R stage), and reports validation steps (checking data source and sensitivity analysis) with specific results (NPV, IRR). This demonstrates a clear, conceptually thorough confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly identifies a Define & Discover stage with clear goals, decision criteria, and key questions before moving to Represent/Implement. Because the D-stage is documented up front and precedes modeling, the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified models, metrics, scenarios, and data needs before coding (Discover + Represent) and then implemented those same elements in code and outputs (Implement), including the planned sensitivities. This shows a coherent plan-to-implementation linkage consistent with the DRIVER criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the required capital structure trade-off (tax shield benefits vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it quantify these or tie them to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. All evidence centers on Starbucks project capital budgeting (NPV/IRR), not capital structure or Apple. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any discussion of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside/bankruptcy risk, nor does it reference coverage metrics. It focuses on capital budgeting (NPV, IRR, payback, WACC sensitivity) only, leaving the criterion unaddressed despite adequate DRIVER process steps.",
