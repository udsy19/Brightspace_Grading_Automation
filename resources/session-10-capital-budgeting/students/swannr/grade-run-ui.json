  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Python implementation and that it produced the expected intermediate and final cash flows, and they verbally validated key assumptions (depreciation, working capital treatment, terminal value timing). These concrete execution and validation statements satisfy the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly presents a Define stage (project question and objectives) and a Discover stage (detailed assumptions) and states the model was designed before coding. There is clear, chronological evidence that Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to implementation, satisfying the strict DRIVER requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a pre-implementation representation (clear plan of tables, metrics, and code structure) and then demonstrated that plan was implemented in Python to produce the expected cash-flow schedule and metrics, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks project capital budgeting and does not analyze capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax shields versus distress/flexibility costs, or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify who gains or loses among different stakeholders or explain incentive misalignments. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage and buybacks. Despite using the DRIVER framework, the analysis remains shareholder-centric and misses the required agency-conflict content.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity financing affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it mention bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. It remains purely a project NPV/IRR analysis under a given WACC across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, leaving the criterion unmet.",
