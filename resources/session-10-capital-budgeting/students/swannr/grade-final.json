  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student links project acceptance to NPV at the firm’s WACC, reports a positive NPV, and interprets this as value creation leading to acceptance. Sensitivity analysis showing NPV remains positive at higher discount rates reinforces correct application of the NPV decision rule.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly planned the cash‑flow construction, implemented it in code, and ran validation checks demonstrating personal execution and verification of intermediate and final cash flows. These steps satisfy the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of accurate cash‑flow projections over the project life.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly planned, executed, and reported sensitivity tests on key assumptions (revenue and WACC), ran the Python model end-to-end, and interpreted results (NPV/IRR behavior) — meeting the strict requirement for personal execution and explicit demonstration of sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies the discount rate, constructs relevant cash flows (including initial outlay, terminal value, and working capital), reports an NPV, and performs discount-rate sensitivity—showing correct conceptual use of NPV. However, they provide limited detail on the discounting mechanics and state \"discounting was unnecessary,\" a conceptual error for NPV. This prevents a thorough PASS, yielding a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student computed and reported an IRR and used it appropriately in decision-making, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero and presented inconsistent IRR values (13.25% vs 18.25%), reducing accuracy and thoroughness. This supports a correct but basic treatment, not a comprehensive one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported both simple and discounted payback periods, supported by an implemented cash flow model. However, they did not detail the methodology for determining the recovery point and included a contradictory statement that “discounting was unnecessary,” which undermines thoroughness. Given moderate strictness, this reflects a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.",

Validate — performed internal consistency checks (depreciation, working capital, terminal value) but did not externally validate or justify the real estate/construction cost assumptions.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented numerical assumptions (including the $12M initial investment) and used them in the model, showing correct DRIVER Discover and Implement work. However, they did not justify or benchmark the real estate/construction cost (no breakdown, sources, or rationale), and validation focused on internal consistency rather than external cost validation, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
