  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately identified the initial outlay, constructed after-tax operating cash flows, included terminal value and working capital recovery, and then discounted at the stated WACC to report NPV and sensitivities. Multiple scenario results and a validation check demonstrate thorough, conceptually sound NPV treatment. Minor phrasing slips do not undermine the correctness or depth.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV acceptance rule (accept if NPV > 0 at WACC) and applies it to both the base case and adverse scenarios, linking negative NPV to value destruction. Multiple scenarios and validation steps show depth beyond a basic mention, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly identifies all key incremental cash flows: initial investment and working capital, annual operating cash flows net of tax with depreciation add-back, and terminal salvage plus working capital recovery, while treating depreciation as non-cash and using WACC for discounting. The Represent, Implement, and Validate stages collectively show a solid, comprehensive application of incremental cash flow principles suitable for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported IRR and showed its sensitivity to revenue, demonstrating basic understanding and application. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or describe the computation approach, falling short of the thorough conceptual treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports both simple and discounted payback, indicating conceptual understanding and implementation. However, they do not show how the payback was derived (cumulative cash flow crossing point), nor discuss implications or sensitivity of payback, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Under moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a Profitability Index and acknowledged the initial investment, showing basic understanding. However, they did not define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment or demonstrate its calculation, and the reported PI appears inconsistent with the stated NPV and outlay. This meets a basic but not thorough treatment, warranting PARTIAL.",
