  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a base-case outcome and multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC shifts) and explicitly identifies a decision-relevant breakpoint (revenue < $9M / 20% drop leading to negative NPV) with recommended monitoring—meeting and exceeding the criterion for scenario and sensitivity analysis. The DRIVER stages (Implement → Evolve → Reflect) show both technical execution and actionable interpretation, supporting a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes using Python, reports concrete computed metrics, and verbally verifies key model mechanics (tax shield, terminal value) and sensitivity scenarios. These statements demonstrate execution of code and validation of outputs consistent with the Represent→Implement→Validate stages, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Discover stage—problem statement, objectives, and key parameters—before describing modeling. The student then describes Represent and only afterward states they implemented the model in Python, satisfying the requirement that Define/Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor quantify these or tie them to Apple’s risk profile. The only “tax shield” discussed is depreciation within a Starbucks project model, which is unrelated to the required capital structure criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting linked to leverage or buybacks. Despite a thorough NPV-focused DRIVER process, the required stakeholder incentive analysis is missing, so the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage or DFL, nor how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. There is no discussion of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics; leverage comments are limited to operating leverage. Under the moderate standard, the absence of DFL/ROE/EPS and debt-risk coverage warrants a FAIL.",
