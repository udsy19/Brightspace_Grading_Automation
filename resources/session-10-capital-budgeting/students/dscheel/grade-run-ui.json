  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numeric NPVs/IRRs, and explicitly identified that a 20% revenue decline flips the stakeholder decision (accept → reject). This meets the criterion and shows applied understanding of breakpoints and driver importance.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes running and inspecting their code, reports concrete numeric outputs, and verbally links those results to the stated assumptions (e.g., why IRR is unchanged, how NPV responds to revenue and WACC changes). This demonstrates thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching logical interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly describes what the tables show, references table structure, and interprets results in dollars, percentages, and years across multiple scenarios. They link outcomes to stakeholder impacts (equity burn) and capital allocation trade-offs (WACC changes and accept/reject decisions), demonstrating thorough, scenario-based verbal explanation aligned to the Implement and Evolve stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off (debt tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction options, nor does it quantify tax benefits or expected costs for each alternative. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile; the work centers on a Starbucks project evaluation with depreciation tax shields only. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project valuation metrics and sensitivity to revenue/WACC but does not identify gains/losses across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor explain incentive conflicts. It also lacks discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is absent.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or calculate DFL. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. References to equity/debt are generic and not supported by leverage math, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
