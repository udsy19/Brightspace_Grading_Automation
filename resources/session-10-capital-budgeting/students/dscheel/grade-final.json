  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV mechanics (discounting future cash flows and handling the year-0 investment), applies it to a detailed 10-year cash flow with WC and terminal value, and provides base-case and sensitivity NPV results with correct acceptance logic. Despite minor phrasing slips, the discussion and applications across Discover, Implement, and Reflect demonstrate strong conceptual mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept when NPV > 0, reject when NPV < 0) to the base case and multiple sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating depth beyond a single example. Despite minor phrasing slips, the discussion shows solid conceptual understanding and comprehensive application across DRIVER stages, meeting the standard for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the rate that makes NPV equal zero and applies it with computed results (base IRR 13.25% and a sensitivity case at 3.19%). They also correctly note IRR’s independence from the chosen hurdle rate and use IRR appropriately in accept/reject decisions. Despite minor phrasing slips, the treatment is thorough and conceptually strong, meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains simple vs. discounted payback and provides specific payback results, demonstrating functional understanding. However, treatment is not thorough: methods (e.g., partial-year interpolation) and inclusion of all initial outflows (e.g., working capital) are not clearly addressed, and wording shows uncertainty (“which I believe was 12 million,” “5.28 to eight years”). This supports a correct but basic coverage—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a PI value and explained its interpretation and decision rule (>1), showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not detail or demonstrate the calculation as “present value of benefits divided by initial investment,” nor provide supporting numbers or methodology, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes and includes key components affecting free cash flow (depreciation/taxes, working capital, initial capex) and discusses their treatment, showing conceptual understanding. However, they incorrectly characterize project cash flow as “revenue minus operating cost,” omitting taxes, depreciation/tax shield, capex, and working capital changes in the stated formula.

Working capital is 500,000 deployed at launch and recovered in year 10. Revenues are 8 million in year 1, 11 million in years 2 to 5, 9 million in years 6 to 10. And then for operating costs we have cost of goods sold are 40% of the revenue. Labor is 2.5 million. Rent and utilities are uh 800,000. marketing is 300,000 in year one and 1 million year or 100,000 year after and then taxes the corporate rate is 25% and the terminal value of 3 million at the end of year 10.\"",

Along with this, please calculate the discount period, simple payback period, and create a profitability index.\"",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented many key assumptions (costs, revenues, depreciation, working capital, tax rate) and implemented them in code, and they justified concern about revenue risk via sensitivity analysis and reflection. However, justification of several specific choices is limited (some parameter values ambiguous or inconsistent with the prompt—e.g., 10M vs 12M initial outlay—and marketing numbers are unclear), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough to earn a full PASS."
