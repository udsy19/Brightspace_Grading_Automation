  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly tied acceptance to creating value over the 8.5% WACC, computed NPV, and used it to make an accept/reject recommendation, also noting near break-even under a downside scenario. The reflection on why NPV (value after cost of capital and time) matters shows conceptual depth consistent with a thorough understanding for this criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student demonstrates thorough automation: parameterized inputs, programmatic cash-flow construction, computation of standard capital budgeting metrics, sensitivity analysis, and validation of components. Multiple DRIVER stages (Implement, Validate, Represent, Evolve) substantiate a strong, comprehensive integration of finance calculations with code-based automation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student modeled distinct phases—initial outlay, operating years with varying revenues and costs, and terminal value/working capital recovery—and implemented them in a coded cash flow table. The detailed timeline, specific assumptions, and verification of all major cash flow components demonstrate a thorough, multi-phase cash flow model sufficient for a PASS under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct, applied understanding of NPV by discounting at WACC, building full cash flows, and using NPV in recommendation and sensitivity. However, they do not show the actual NPV calculation or result, and there’s ambiguity (terminal value timing), so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly indicates that IRR was computed within their model and used for decision-making, demonstrating basic understanding. However, they provide no numeric IRR, no explanation of IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero, and no methodological detail, so coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and included payback period analysis in their model and workflow, showing conceptual understanding. However, they provided no payback calculation, result, or explanation of methodology, so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",
