  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the Python code and observing intermediate outputs, and they verbally confirm validation steps (component inclusion and scenario responses) that align with stated assumptions. Although numeric output details are not shown, the moderate evaluation standard accepts this conceptual confirmation as sufficient.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states a Defined stage and a Discovery stage with concrete assumptions and cash-flow components, and then describes Represent as planning (no calculation) followed by Implementation. This shows Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to modeling, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented a pre-implementation representation (timeline, model order, and the explicit goal to plan rather than compute) and then demonstrated linkage by implementing those elements in code (assumptions block, cash-flow table, scenarios, and metrics). This systematic plan-to-implementation trace meets the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires analyzing the leverage trade-off—quantifying tax shield benefits versus expected distress/optionality costs across payout/debt choices—and tying conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk. The submission focuses on Starbucks project NPV/IRR and never discusses buybacks, dividends, debt reduction, tax shields from leverage, distress costs, or Apple. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR modeling and sensitivity but provides no discussion of incentive divergences across stakeholders, who gains/loses under financing or payout options, or asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics. Under the moderate standard, at least a conceptual treatment was required; none is present.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage effects, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It concentrates on project valuation (NPV/IRR) and sensitivity to WACC/revenue, which is outside this criterion. Therefore, it fails this criterion.",
