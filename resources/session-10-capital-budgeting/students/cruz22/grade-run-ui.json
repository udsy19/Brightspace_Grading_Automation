  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly verifies code execution (debugged and ran in Colab), reports specific numeric outputs (NPV $4.34M, IRR ~13.25%, sensitivity: NPV 4.3 → 3.4) and explains why the results change with discount rate, satisfying both execution confirmation and logical validation. These show thorough, consistent verbal confirmation aligned with the DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documents the problem statement, objectives, and key parameters at the start (Discover) and then proceeds to include those parameters in code and run NPV/IRR calculations (Represent/Implement). There is no evidence the Discover stage was done post-hoc, meeting the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified models, scenarios, and metrics (initial investment, horizon, discount rate, cash flows, NPV/IRR) before and during implementation and then mapped those inputs to implemented artifacts (parameterized Python model, cash-flow table, NPV/IRR calculations and sensitivity tests). This demonstrates a systematic plan-to-implementation linkage consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off (tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility costs), does not compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, provides no quantification of tax advantages or distress/optionality costs, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The work centers on project evaluation (NPV/IRR) for Starbucks, which is unrelated to the specified criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR and shareholder value with no discussion of conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor who gains/loses under different actions. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Hence it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses project valuation (NPV/IRR, WACC, sensitivity) but does not address financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
