  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed an IRR (~13.25%) and accurately interpreted it as the discount rate at which NPV equals zero (“break even”), then reinforced understanding via a sensitivity check showing NPV declines as the discount rate approaches IRR. This demonstrates solid conceptual grasp and application consistent with a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student used Python in Colab to automate core capital budgeting calculations (NPV, IRR) and produce a cash flow table, then demonstrated parameterized recalculation for sensitivity analysis. This shows substantive integration of technology with finance and multiple applications, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a structured capital budgeting framework: sets parameters, computes NPV and IRR, examines cash flows, and conducts sensitivity analysis, showing a systematic approach. Despite minor imprecision in phrasing decision rules, the coverage is detailed and applied across multiple facets, satisfying a thorough treatment for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied NPV at a stated discount rate, reported a positive NPV, and explored sensitivity and IRR, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the conflation of “positive cash flow” with an acceptable project indicates a notable conceptual error about NPV decision criteria. Given the moderate standard, this is sufficient for a basic but incomplete treatment, not a thorough, error-free one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and ties it to the discount rate, showing applied understanding. However, they conflate positive cash flow with the acceptance criterion, which is inaccurate for NPV decisions. Given this noticeable conceptual gap, the treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never determines or states the payback period (the year cumulative cash flows recover the $12M). While they compute NPV/IRR and mention annual cash flows, they do not translate these into a recovery time, leaving the criterion unaddressed under the moderate standard.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — student states project parameters (initial investment, 10-year life, 8.5% discount) and goal of assessing shareholder value.  \nImplement — student reports calculating NPV/IRR in Collab, presents numeric results and a sensitivity test (NPV falling from $4.34M to $3.4M at a higher discount).  \nReflect — student interprets results: positive NPV => accept, explains how increasing discount rate (WACC/risk) reduces NPV and affects decision margin.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides specific numeric results (NPV, IRR, cash-flow magnitudes), describes the computational approach, and performs sensitivity analysis while explaining the economic rationale (risk, WACC, acceptance rule). These elements show a thorough, conceptually grounded explanation consistent with the DRIVER stages, satisfying the PASS standard."
