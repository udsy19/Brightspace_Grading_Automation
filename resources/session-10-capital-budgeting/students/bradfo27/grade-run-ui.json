  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, describes the key modeling assumptions that underpin outputs, and confirms the outputs (MPV ~ $3–4M) are consistent and intuitive. Together, these provide thorough verbal confirmation of execution and validation across the REPRESENT→IMPLEMENT→VALIDATE stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, objectives, and project parameters up front and documents the required components before any coding, satisfying the requirement that Define & Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling. Representative planning (\"Before writing any of my code...\") and the subsequent transition to Implement confirm the correct sequence.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented a pre-implementation representation of models, inputs, and planned metrics, then explicitly linked that plan to implemented code (parameter dictionary, cash flow generation, sensitivity analysis). This demonstrates a systematic represent-to-implement workflow consistent with the DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, tax shield benefits, financial distress/flexibility costs, or payout versus debt reduction choices, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. It focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis instead. Even under moderate strictness, there is no conceptual or quantitative treatment of the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it address asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. It focuses solely on shareholder NPV and process, leaving the required stakeholder-incentive analysis absent.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of leverage math (DFL), ROE/EPS volatility under different financing choices, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. The work focuses on unlevered project appraisal (NPV/IRR at WACC) and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, which does not satisfy this leverage-specific criterion.",
