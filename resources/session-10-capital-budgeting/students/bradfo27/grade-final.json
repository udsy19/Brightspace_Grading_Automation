  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting calculations by coding a parameterized Python model that generates multi-year cash flows and computes NPV/IRR/PI/paybacks, plus automated sensitivity analyses and visualizations. The Represent, Implement, and Validate stages collectively show a thorough, applied approach beyond surface-level discussion, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly modeled multiple phases: initial investment (Year 0), operating years, and terminal value with working capital recovery (Year 10), and implemented this in Python to generate year 0–10 cash flows with tax/depreciation effects. The discussion shows comprehensive coverage and phase distinctions, meeting the moderate standard for depth and application.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a comprehensive, systematic investment evaluation framework: scoped components, built an annual incremental cash flow model including WC and terminal value, applied multiple decision metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback), and performed sensitivity analysis. The DISCOVER, REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE/EVOLVE stages collectively demonstrate thoroughness beyond basic discussion, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of NPV by identifying relevant cash flows, including Year 0 outlay and terminal items, and discounting at WACC, reporting a positive result. However, they provide no detailed NPV calculation or figures and repeatedly mislabel NPV as “MPV,” indicating incomplete rigor. This meets a correct-but-basic standard rather than a thorough treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by computing NPV with the firm’s WACC and concluding to accept the project because NPV is positive. However, they don’t articulate the full decision rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0, indifferent at 0) or explore edge cases, making the treatment correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and referenced IRR and used it appropriately by comparing it to WACC, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the rate that makes NPV equal zero or demonstrate the computation methodology, leaving the treatment surface-level rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",
