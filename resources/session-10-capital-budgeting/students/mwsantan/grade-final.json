  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set the discount rate, identified and incorporated the initial investment and working capital, modeled incremental cash flows with taxes/depreciation and terminal-year adjustments, and computed/interpreted a positive NPV, including sensitivity to WACC and revenue. Despite minor typos, the treatment is detailed and applied across DRIVER stages, demonstrating a strong conceptual grasp of NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule across base and sensitivity cases, explicitly stating that positive NPV implies acceptance/value creation and negative NPV implies the project is unviable. Multiple scenarios (base, revenue down, higher WACC) demonstrate applied understanding, satisfying a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student demonstrates automation by describing a parameterized Python model that computes cash flows, NPV, and IRR and incorporates depreciation tax shields and terminal adjustments. They applied it to produce results and indicate sensitivity analyses, showing comprehensive, tech-enabled capital budgeting. This depth across Represent and Implement (with Evolve capability) meets a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies IRR by computing it and comparing it to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero or show how it was computed, and they provide conflicting IRR figures (12.58% vs 14.25%), which reduces accuracy. Thus, the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly reported both simple and discounted payback with specific values and confirmed they fall within project life, showing conceptual understanding. However, there is minimal explanation of methodology, no cumulative cash flow demonstration, and limited interpretation of payback’s implications or limitations. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported a PI (>1) and defined the initial investment, indicating basic understanding. However, they did not explain the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show the calculation steps or PV of benefits, so treatment is brief rather than thorough. Under moderate strictness, this supports a correct but basic demonstration, hence PARTIAL.",
