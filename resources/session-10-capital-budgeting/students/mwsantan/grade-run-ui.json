  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case and ran multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and higher WACC), used a parameterized model to vary assumptions, and explicitly identified the breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts (revenue drop makes NPV negative). This demonstrates thorough and correct treatment of the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student built sensitivity capability into the model and executed multiple stress tests (revenue down 20%, WACC up to 10.5%) with quantified impacts. They clearly explained how these shifts change the risk profile and potential decision, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level for a moderate evaluation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the Define/Discover outputs (problem statement, objectives, and key financial inputs) before describing the Represent/modeling stage, and confirms those parameters were initialized in the model. No evidence of a missing or post-hoc D-stage is present, so the criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs, no comparison of buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, and no connection to Apple’s balance sheet. The DRIVER work focuses on project evaluation for Starbucks, not the required capital structure trade-off criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the criterion’s requirements and the absence of any stakeholder incentive analysis, this merits a FAIL despite adequate DRIVER process use for valuation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside risk, nor does it analyze bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics under varying debt levels. It focuses on NPV/IRR and sensitivity to revenue and WACC, which does not satisfy the specific leverage criterion even under moderate standards.",
