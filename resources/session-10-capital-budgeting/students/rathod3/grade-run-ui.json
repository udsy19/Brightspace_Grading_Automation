  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran the base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numerical impacts, and explicitly identified the breakpoint where a 20% revenue shortfall flips the accept/reject decision. They also discussed robustness to cost-of-capital changes and recommended further break-even testing, demonstrating thorough and actionable sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, reviewed base-case outputs (NPV, IRR, PI) and executed sensitivity tests, meeting the requirement to validate outputs against expectations. They also articulate key assumptions (working capital timing, taxable terminal value, straight-line depreciation) and flag a concrete code logic error, demonstrating active validation and correction—thus a thorough treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables show (line items by year and resulting cash flows/metrics) and explains the units (dollars, percentages) and scenarios (base case, revenue -20%, WACC ±2%). This thorough, scenario-based verbalization of tabular outputs supports capital allocation decisions (accept/reject), meeting and exceeding the criterion at a moderate strictness level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs (debt tax shield vs financial distress/flexibility) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and depreciation/tax treatment, not debt-related capital structure analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission focuses on project valuation and operational sensitivity without discussing agency conflicts or identifying winners/losers across stakeholders. It does not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage/buybacks. Therefore, it fails to meet this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage and WACC sensitivity but does not address financial leverage, DFL, or how debt/equity choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the absence of these elements, the criterion is not met.",
