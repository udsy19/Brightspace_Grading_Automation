  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and repeatedly applies the NPV decision rule: accept if NPV > 0 (at the hurdle rate), reject if NPV < 0. They demonstrate this in base-case results and multiple sensitivities (revenue down, WACC up), providing concrete accept/reject conclusions. This comprehensive, applied treatment meets the standard for a PASS despite unrelated payback issues.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR from modeled cash flows, reported a base-case IRR (13.25%), compared it appropriately to the 8.5% hurdle, and performed sensitivity showing IRR falling to 3.88% under a 20% revenue drop. This demonstrates a strong, applied grasp of IRR as the discount rate making NPV zero, with multiple applications across scenarios. Minor inconsistencies elsewhere do not undermine the thorough treatment of IRR.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrated strong conceptual mastery by identifying an erroneous computed payback, diagnosing the cause (cumulative cash flow logic), and providing a reasonable corrected estimate (~5.2 years) grounded in the cash flow schedule. This depth of analysis and self-correction meets the moderate standard and reflects thorough treatment of payback period determination despite the initial error.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates solid conceptual understanding of NPV, including discounting free cash flows at WACC, handling year-0 working capital, and recognizing terminal value taxability, and they apply it to a full model with sensitivity analysis. However, the Year 10 cash flow includes the full $3M terminal value without after-tax adjustment, overstating the NPV, which is a notable accuracy gap. Given the moderate standard, this merits a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied the PI (reported 1.347 and used the >1 acceptance rule), showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not define the PI as “present value of benefits divided by initial investment” or show how it was calculated, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and plans for working capital timing and the taxable nature of salvage value, and includes WC recovery and terminal cash flows in the schedule. However, the year 10 tax line omits the tax on the $3M terminal value, indicating an execution inaccuracy despite the stated intent. Given solid conceptual discussion but inconsistent application, this merits a PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents key real‑estate/construction assumptions (total capex components, depreciation schedule, WC timing and terminal treatment) and critiques them, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not validate the $12M construction/real‑estate estimate with supporting justification, cost breakdown, or external benchmarks, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS."
