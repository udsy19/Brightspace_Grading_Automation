It's Justin here, 0:00:01.520,0:00:02.720 and in this presentation, 0:00:02.720,0:00:04.800 I'm going to walk through my full capital 0:00:04.800,0:00:06.640 budgeting analysis of Starbucks' 0:00:06.640,0:00:08.800 proposed flagship grocery project, 0:00:08.800,0:00:10.640 and I'll be using the DRIVER framework 0:00:10.640,0:00:13.600 to guide the process. And also, I'll be, 0:00:13.600,0:00:14.400 I'll be building 0:00:14.400,0:00:18.160 the entire model in Python so we can see each state clearly. 0:00:18.160,0:00:19.920 So the goal here is to evaluate 0:00:19.920,0:00:21.360 whether this 10-year investment 0:00:21.360,0:00:22.880 creates value for Starbucks, 0:00:22.880,0:00:24.080 and to understand the reason 0:00:24.080,0:00:26.080 and assumption behind the numbers. 0:00:26.080,0:00:29.040 So I'll start with define and discover. 0:00:29.040,0:00:31.200 In this stage, my goal is just to set up 0:00:31.200,0:00:32.160 the entire problem 0:00:32.160,0:00:34.400 clearly before doing any modeling. 0:00:34.400,0:00:36.000 I'm not calculating anything yet, 0:00:36.000,0:00:38.000 But I'm only organizing the inputs 0:00:38.000,0:00:40.960 and understanding what Starbucks is trying to decide. 0:00:40.960,0:00:42.160 So, the main question here 0:00:42.160,0:00:43.600 is pretty straightforward. 0:00:43.600,0:00:45.360 Should Starbucks invest $12 million 0:00:45.360,0:00:46.400 in a flagship roastery 0:00:46.400,0:00:50.480 that runs for 10 years using an 8.5% WACC 0:00:50.480,0:00:52.640 as the hurdle rate? 0:00:52.640,0:00:54.320 and my job is to evaluate 0:00:54.320,0:00:58.320 whether this project creates value based on NPV, IRR, payback, 0:00:58.320,0:01:00.320 and some sensitivity tests. 0:01:00.320,0:01:02.080 So before jumping into any formulas, 0:01:02.080,0:01:03.280 I lay out the key question 0:01:03.280,0:01:06.080 I need to answer. First of all is, 0:01:06.080,0:01:10.800 does the project generate a positive NPV at 8.5% WACC? 0:01:10.800,0:01:12.800 Second is how strong are the IRR, 0:01:12.800,0:01:15.280 the simple and discounted payback periods, 0:01:15.280,0:01:18.560 and the profitability index? Third one is, 0:01:18.560,0:01:19.840 how sensitive are the results 0:01:19.840,0:01:20.800 to revenue dropping 0:01:20.800,0:01:23.040 or changes in the discount rate? 0:01:23.040,0:01:24.480 And lastly, beyond the numbers, 0:01:24.480,0:01:29.200 how well does a flagship roastery support Starbucks' brand and long-term strategy? 0:01:29.200,0:01:30.880 So after defining the problems, 0:01:30.880,0:01:33.120 I summarized all the important inputs 0:01:33.120,0:01:35.200 that the assignment gave me. 0:01:35.200,0:01:37.440 So we can see here, Starbucks needs 0:01:37.440,0:01:41.920 a 12 million upfront investment plus 500,000 in working, 0:01:41.920,0:01:43.200 in working capital, 0:01:43.200,0:01:46.000 which gets recovered in year ten. 0:01:46.000,0:01:48.320 And... The project will last for ten years. 0:01:48.320,0:01:51.120 The corporate tax rate is around 25%, 0:01:51.120,0:01:52.160 and the terminal value 0:01:52.160,0:01:53.680 is around three million. 0:01:53.680,0:01:55.280 So let me show you all those things. 0:01:55.280,0:01:58.720 You can see here, everything is right here, 0:01:58.720,0:02:00.400 and depreciation is straight line 0:02:00.400,0:02:01.760 over ten years, 0:02:01.760,0:02:05.760 so that's 1.2 million a year. 0:02:05.760,0:02:07.760 And let's move on to the revenues. 0:02:07.760,0:02:09.920 For the revenues, the Roastery is expected 0:02:09.920,0:02:11.840 to generate eight million in year one, 0:02:11.840,0:02:13.440 11 million in year two to five, 0:02:13.440,0:02:16.400 and nine million in year six to ten. 0:02:16.400,0:02:17.600 And for the cost structure, 0:02:17.600,0:02:19.840 you can see here, this line. 0:02:19.840,0:02:22.320 The cost of goods sold is 40% of revenue. 0:02:22.320,0:02:24.240 Labor is 2.5 million a year. 0:02:24.240,0:02:26.400 Rent and utilities are 0.8 million, 0:02:26.400,0:02:29.200 and marketing is tr- 0.3 million for year one 0:02:29.200,0:02:32.240 and then drops to 0.1 million afterwards. 0:02:32.240,0:02:33.600 This is the depreciation rule 0:02:33.600,0:02:36.160 I was talking about, it's straight line 0:02:36.160,0:02:39.040 and it's around 1.2 million a year. 0:02:39.040,0:02:42.960 And this is the marketing schedule by year. 0:02:42.960,0:02:44.800 And this is the assumption. 0:02:44.800,0:02:45.280 So 0:02:45.280,0:02:47.520 also talk about the assumptions I'm using. 0:02:47.520,0:02:48.160 So, for example, 0:02:48.160,0:02:50.800 our trade terminal values as after tax, 0:02:50.800,0:02:53.040 working capital recover is tax neutral 0:02:53.040,0:02:57.680 and there's no new cap EX after year zero. 0:02:57.680,0:03:01.040 So if EBIT happens to be negative in any year, 0:03:01.040,0:03:02.800 I cap the taxes at zero, 0:03:02.800,0:03:06.560 and everything I'm doing here is in millions of dollars. 0:03:06.560,0:03:08.400 So this is the table I got. 0:03:08.400,0:03:10.000 we can slowly go through it. 0:03:10.000,0:03:10.640 You can see... This 0:03:10.640,0:03:12.640 is the operating cost structure, 0:03:12.640,0:03:13.760 like the cost of goods sold. 0:03:13.760,0:03:15.200 Like everything I was talking just now. 0:03:15.200,0:03:17.040 The marketing spend by year. 0:03:17.040,0:03:17.680 Only the first year 0:03:17.680,0:03:19.200 is zero point three million and others 0:03:19.200,0:03:21.280 are zero point one million. 0:03:21.280,0:03:24.080 And this is the depreciation assumption, 0:03:24.080,0:03:26.240 which is straight line, 12 million, 0:03:26.240,0:03:28.400 and it's 1.2 million per year, 0:03:28.400,0:03:31.120 because it's for ten years. 0:03:31.120,0:03:34.960 And this is the key modeling assumption. 0:03:34.960,0:03:37.440 And once I have the problem, the question, 0:03:37.440,0:03:39.280 the data and the assumption fully laid out, 0:03:39.280,0:03:41.440 I put all of this into Python, 0:03:41.440,0:03:43.040 dictionaries and data frames. 0:03:43.040,0:03:43.840 So at this point, 0:03:43.840,0:03:46.880 I'm not calculating cashflows or NPV yet. 0:03:46.880,0:03:48.400 That comes later in the represent 0:03:48.400,0:03:49.440 and implement stage. 0:03:49.440,0:03:52.880 So, let's move on to the represent stage. 0:03:52.880,0:03:54.400 So, in this stage, 0:03:54.400,0:03:56.480 the goal here is to turn all the outputs 0:03:56.480,0:03:58.640 from define and discover into a structure, 0:03:58.640,0:03:59.920 cashflow model, 0:03:59.920,0:04:03.360 but I'm still not calculating NPV or IRR yet. 0:04:03.360,0:04:05.040 So, in this- In this part of notebook, 0:04:05.040,0:04:06.800 I'm doing three main things. 0:04:06.800,0:04:12.080 First of all is I lay out all the full cash flow layout from year zero to year ten, 0:04:12.080,0:04:13.520 that includes revenue, 0:04:13.520,0:04:15.840 op- operating cost, depreciation, 0:04:15.840,0:04:19.280 EBIT, tax, operating cash flow, 0:04:19.280,0:04:21.920 working capital flows, the terminal value, 0:04:21.920,0:04:24.080 and finally free cash flow. 0:04:24.080,0:04:27.760 And secondly, I'm gonna make a formula explicit. 0:04:27.760,0:04:29.120 So, every line in this table 0:04:29.120,0:04:30.160 is tied directly 0:04:30.160,0:04:32.800 to an assumption from define and discover. 0:04:32.800,0:04:37.200 And lastly, I use Python to build one clean cash flow table 0:04:37.200,0:04:40.800 that I'll later plug into NPV, IRR, payback, 0:04:40.800,0:04:44.640 and sensitivity analysis in the implement stage. 0:04:44.640,0:04:45.520 So, let me walk through 0:04:45.520,0:04:47.200 what the code is doing. 0:04:47.200,0:04:48.080 so for each year, 0:04:48.080,0:04:50.000 the model starts with revenue, 0:04:50.000,0:04:51.600 then it calculates cost of goods sold 0:04:51.600,0:04:53.200 as 40% of revenue, 0:04:53.200,0:04:55.680 and adds- The fixed cost which is, 0:04:55.680,0:04:58.080 you can see here, the fixed cost, 0:04:58.080,0:05:00.160 which is labor of 2.5 million, 0:05:00.160,0:05:02.880 rent and utilities of 0.8 million, 0:05:02.880,0:05:08.720 and marketing which is 0.3 year one and 0.1 from year two onwards. 0:05:08.720,0:05:10.720 So I subtract all of those plus straight 0:05:10.720,0:05:14.720 line depreciation of 1.2 million to get EBIT. 0:05:14.720,0:05:19.120 So from EBIT, I apply the 25% tax rate. 0:05:19.120,0:05:22.320 This is EBIT, you can see here. 0:05:22.320,0:05:25.280 So from EBIT, I apply the 25% tax rate, 0:05:25.280,0:05:27.280 but only when EBIT is positive. 0:05:27.280,0:05:30.400 so if EBIT is negative, taxes are zero. 0:05:30.400,0:05:32.880 EBIT minus taxes give me no pat. 0:05:32.880,0:05:35.600 You can see here, no pat, this one. 0:05:35.600,0:05:39.760 And then I add back depreciation to get the operating cash flow. 0:05:39.760,0:05:41.600 You can see the last one here. 0:05:41.600,0:05:44.480 So, you can see all of that in the output table. 0:05:44.480,0:05:45.760 Let me show you the output table. 0:05:45.760,0:05:49.040 This is the output table. 0:05:49.040,0:05:51.120 So, we can see that this is year zero. 0:05:51.120,0:05:54.960 Year zero shows the initial hit of negative 12.5 0:05:54.960,0:05:56.640 million in the free cashflow, 0:05:56.640,0:05:59.040 which is our total upfront investment, 0:05:59.040,0:05:59.600 and second, 0:05:59.600,0:06:02.000 you can see from year one to year nine, 0:06:02.000,0:06:06.640 we have positive operating cash flow in the 1.2 to 2.7 range, 0:06:06.640,0:06:07.200 you can see here, 0:06:07.200,0:06:11.280 1.2, 2.7, 2.7, until like 1.8. 0:06:11.280,0:06:13.280 So depending on the revenues, 0:06:13.280,0:06:15.760 and lastly, year ten has the largest free cashflow, 0:06:15.760,0:06:19.440 which is, uh, at 5.3 million because of the terminal value 0:06:19.440,0:06:21.760 and the working capital recovery. 0:06:21.760,0:06:24.400 So, this table is the core engine of the model. 0:06:24.400,0:06:25.680 I now have a full series 0:06:25.680,0:06:28.560 of free cash flow from year zero to year ten. 0:06:28.560,0:06:31.280 So in the next stage, which is implement, 0:06:31.280,0:06:33.040 I'll take this free cash flow column 0:06:33.040,0:06:36.560 and use it to compute NPV, IRR, payback, 0:06:36.560,0:06:42.080 and the sensitivity analysis. Oh, elect. 0:06:42.080,0:06:44.400 So, now I'm in the implement stage. 0:06:44.400,0:06:45.520 So up to this point, 0:06:45.520,0:06:47.680 I've only designed the cash flow structure. 0:06:47.680,0:06:50.080 So here, I actually let the model run. 0:06:50.080,0:06:53.120 I take the free cashflow column from year zero to year ten, 0:06:53.120,0:06:54.880 and feed it into python functions that-- 0:06:54.880,0:06:58.000 to generate all the capital budgeting metrics. 0:06:58.000,0:06:59.760 So, in this code cell, 0:06:59.760,0:07:03.040 I first extract the list of cashflow and then define 0:07:03.040,0:07:06.080 a few helper function. One for NPV, 0:07:06.080,0:07:08.320 you can see here, this is NPV. 0:07:08.320,0:07:12.000 One for IRR, this one. 0:07:12.000,0:07:15.360 And using a simple- bisection search 0:07:15.360,0:07:17.760 and separate function for simple playback, 0:07:17.760,0:07:19.280 this-- which is this one. 0:07:19.280,0:07:21.440 And also the discounted playback 0:07:21.440,0:07:22.800 that walk through the cashflow 0:07:22.800,0:07:25.920 until the cumulative amount turn positive. 0:07:25.920,0:07:28.400 This is a discounted playback. 0:07:28.400,0:07:31.680 So, I also compute the pro- profitability index 0:07:31.680,0:07:33.360 by comparing the present value 0:07:33.360,0:07:36.880 of inflows to the initial 12.5 million outlay. 0:07:36.880,0:07:38.720 And you can see here, 0:07:38.720,0:07:41.600 like, this is the profitability index, 0:07:41.600,0:07:44.000 the whole thing. 0:07:44.000,0:07:46.320 I also compute the profitability index 0:07:46.320,0:07:47.760 by comparing the present value 0:07:47.760,0:07:51.040 of inflows to the initial 12.5 million outlay, 0:07:51.040,0:07:51.680 and after that, 0:07:51.680,0:07:54.400 I call this function on the base cashflow series 0:07:54.400,0:07:57.200 so the code prints out the full set of metrics 0:07:57.200,0:07:58.880 in one place. 0:07:58.880,0:08:00.480 You can see the result here. 0:08:00.480,0:08:03.040 At Starbucks 8.5% WACC, 0:08:03.040,0:08:05.600 the NPV is about 3.02 million, 0:08:05.600,0:08:06.240 which is positive, 0:08:06.240,0:08:09.280 and the IRR is around 13.25%, 0:08:09.280,0:08:11.120 which is higher than the hurdle rate. 0:08:11.120,0:08:12.400 The simple payback periods 0:08:12.400,0:08:14.800 is roughly 5.28 years, 0:08:14.800,0:08:16.240 so while the discounted payback 0:08:16.240,0:08:18.000 is about 8.21 years 0:08:18.000,0:08:20.320 once I account for discounting. 0:08:20.320,0:08:22.720 So the profitability index comes out to 0:08:22.720,0:08:25.120 about 1.24, meaning every dollar 0:08:25.120,0:08:29.040 invest generates about $1.24 of present value. 0:08:29.040,0:08:33.520 And then I implement the- ... sensitivity analysis in code, 0:08:33.520,0:08:34.560 I used a helper function 0:08:34.560,0:08:36.480 that rebuilds the cashflow but multiplies 0:08:36.480,0:08:38.080 revenue by 80%, 0:08:38.080,0:08:42.800 and I rerun NPV and IRR on that lower revenue scenario. 0:08:42.800,0:08:45.520 So in that case, based on, 0:08:45.520,0:08:47.440 the result, we can see that the, 0:08:47.440,0:08:52.000 the NPV drops to about negative 3.16 million, 0:08:52.000,0:08:55.760 and the IRR falls to about 3.19%, 0:08:55.760,0:08:59.360 which is well below the 8.5% hurdle. 0:08:59.360,0:09:11.520 Uh, I also look over three different discount rates, 0:09:11.520,0:09:15.760 which is 6.5%, 8.5%, and 10.5% to see 0:09:15.760,0:09:18.240 to see how NPV changes with WACC. 0:09:18.240,0:09:22.480 So the NPVs are roughly 4.64 million at 6.5%, 0:09:22.480,0:09:25.120 3.02 million at 8.5%, 0:09:25.120,0:09:28.400 and 1.63 million at 10.5%. 0:09:30.720,0:09:33.120 So the project stays positive even when 0:09:33.120,0:09:35.200 the cost of capital is higher, 0:09:35.200,0:09:36.320 so the implement stage 0:09:36.320,0:09:37.600 is where I execute the model 0:09:37.600,0:09:40.000 and produce all of these numbers using Python. 0:09:40.000,0:09:44.480 I'm not giving a final yes or no here yet. 0:09:44.480,0:09:44.980 those, 0:09:45.440,0:09:47.840 recommendation will come next in the validate 0:09:47.840,0:09:49.680 and evolve stage. 0:09:49.680,0:09:52.480 So, let's move on to the validate stage. 0:09:52.480,0:09:54.000 So in this stage, at this point, 0:09:54.000,0:09:55.520 I'm not changing any formulas. 0:09:55.520,0:09:57.200 I'm just checking that the numbers 0:09:57.200,0:09:58.320 coming out from my model 0:09:58.320,0:10:00.240 is actually make sense. 0:10:00.240,0:10:01.840 So, the first thing I do here 0:10:01.840,0:10:04.240 is print the free cash flow by year. 0:10:04.240,0:10:06.640 The pattern looks exactly how it should. 0:10:06.640,0:10:07.920 Let me show you the result first, 0:10:07.920,0:10:10.080 and this is how I do it. 0:10:10.080,0:10:12.880 And this is the graph. So you can see 0:10:12.880,0:10:15.600 that there's a large negative cashflow in year zero, 0:10:15.600,0:10:18.080 which is negative 12.5 million, 0:10:18.080,0:10:19.520 which is our initial investment 0:10:19.520,0:10:20.800 and working capital, 0:10:20.800,0:10:22.400 followed by positive cashflow 0:10:22.400,0:10:23.680 in every single year after that. 0:10:23.680,0:10:26.400 You can see from year one to year 10. 0:10:26.400,0:10:29.840 And by year 10, it jumps to around 5.3 0:10:29.840,0:10:31.760 million because of the terminal value 0:10:31.760,0:10:34.080 and the working capital net recovery. 0:10:34.080,0:10:36.400 So this confirms the cashflow engine 0:10:36.400,0:10:37.440 is behaving the way 0:10:37.440,0:10:40.320 a normal investment project should. 0:10:40.320,0:10:44.880 So next, I checked whether the IRR actually solved 0:10:44.880,0:10:47.520 the NPV equals to zero. 0:10:47.520,0:10:50.240 You can see here the second part, this part. 0:10:50.240,0:10:54.080 So I plugged the calculator IRR back into the NPV function, 0:10:54.080,0:10:57.600 and the result comes out extremely close to zero here, 0:10:57.600,0:10:59.280 if I'm not wrong. 0:10:59.280,0:11:00.640 So you can see here basically 0:11:00.640,0:11:03.200 a tiny rounding number which shows me 0:11:03.200,0:11:08.320 that the IRR calculation is working correctly. 0:11:08.320,0:11:10.000 so to visualize things, 0:11:10.000,0:11:11.680 I plot the free cash flow profile, 0:11:11.680,0:11:13.840 and you can see timing really clearly, 0:11:13.840,0:11:16.560 you can see here that, this, this thing, 0:11:16.560,0:11:18.160 and one big upfront outflow 0:11:18.160,0:11:21.600 and a stable stream of inflows afterwards. 0:11:21.600,0:11:25.120 And then I plot NPV as a function of the discount rate, 0:11:25.120,0:11:30.880 that you can see here. 0:11:30.880,0:11:32.640 and the curve slopes downwards 0:11:32.640,0:11:34.400 exactly the way it should, 0:11:34.400,0:11:37.360 so it crosses the zero line around 13%, 0:11:37.360,0:11:39.920 which matches the IRR calculator earlier. 0:11:39.920,0:11:42.320 So that consistency confirms that the model 0:11:42.320,0:11:43.840 is doing what it's supposed to do. 0:11:43.840,0:11:46.880 So overall, validate is just my sanity check stage. 0:11:46.880,0:11:48.640 So I'm making sure the cash flow looks right 0:11:48.640,0:11:51.440 and the IRR behave correctly. 0:11:51.440,0:11:54.160 So, let's move on to the evolve stage. 0:11:54.160,0:11:55.120 So in this stage, 0:11:55.120,0:11:56.480 this is where I take everything from 0:11:56.480,0:11:58.080 the implement and validate stage 0:11:58.080,0:11:59.600 and actually interpret 0:11:59.600,0:12:01.360 what the result mean for startup, 0:12:01.360,0:12:04.800 both financially and strategically. 0:12:04.800,0:12:06.240 So starting with the base case, 0:12:06.240,0:12:07.680 the project looks solid. 0:12:07.680,0:12:10.160 The NPV at an 8.5% WACC 0:12:10.160,0:12:11.280 is about three million dollars, 0:12:11.280,0:12:13.680 and the IRR is around 13.3%, 0:12:13.680,0:12:15.920 So it clears Starbucks hurdle rate. 0:12:15.920,0:12:17.600 So payback also makes sense 0:12:17.600,0:12:20.560 because it's little over five years on a simple basis 0:12:20.560,0:12:23.680 and about 8.2 years when discounted. 0:12:23.680,0:12:26.960 The profitability index is roughly 1.24, 0:12:26.960,0:12:29.120 which means the present value of inflows 0:12:29.120,0:12:32.080 is about 24% higher than the investment. 0:12:32.080,0:12:34.080 So financially, in the base case, 0:12:34.080,0:12:36.320 this investment works. 0:12:36.320,0:12:38.080 but the important part of Evolve 0:12:38.080,0:12:40.080 is understanding what drives the risk. 0:12:40.080,0:12:42.240 So when I run the revenue sensitivity 0:12:42.240,0:12:44.800 and reduce all revenues by 20%, 0:12:44.800,0:12:46.320 this is the result I got, 0:12:46.320,0:12:48.720 and this is the code I'm going with. 0:12:48.720,0:12:51.600 So you can see that, uh, the NPV flips 0:12:51.600,0:12:53.040 from positive three million 0:12:53.040,0:12:55.360 to negative three point sixty million, 0:12:55.360,0:12:58.560 and the IRR drops to just 3.2%. 0:12:58.560,0:12:59.840 The chart here... ... 0:12:59.840,0:13:01.840 makes the shift really obvious, 0:13:01.840,0:13:04.880 because the base case NPV bar is strongly positive in green 0:13:04.880,0:13:09.840 and the negative 20% revenue bar drops sharply into the red. 0:13:09.840,0:13:11.600 So this tells me that revenue 0:13:11.600,0:13:13.680 is the dominant driver of value 0:13:13.680,0:13:15.280 for this project, 0:13:15.280,0:13:17.600 so if traffic, pricing power, 0:13:17.600,0:13:19.200 or demand disappoints... 0:13:19.200,0:13:22.160 The economics can turn negative very quickly. 0:13:22.160,0:13:24.160 Then I check the other sensitivity, 0:13:24.160,0:13:26.880 which is the discount rate. 0:13:26.880,0:13:27.920 Uh, the discount rate 0:13:27.920,0:13:30.480 when I change WACC to 6.5%, 0:13:30.480,0:13:34.080 8.5% and 10.5% in the implement stage, 0:13:34.080,0:13:36.320 The NPV stays positive in all three cases, 0:13:36.320,0:13:38.880 ranging from about 4.64 million down 0:13:38.880,0:13:40.720 to 1.63 million, 0:13:40.720,0:13:46.000 so the project isn't that sensitive to Starbucks' cost of capital or financing assumption. 0:13:46.000,0:13:47.520 So, that reinforced the idea 0:13:47.520,0:13:50.400 that the risk, the key risk is operational 0:13:50.400,0:13:51.680 and demand-driven, 0:13:51.680,0:13:53.040 not financial. 0:13:53.040,0:13:54.880 So, from a strategy perspective, 0:13:54.880,0:13:57.520 a flagship roastery is more than just a financing 0:13:57.520,0:14:00.160 -financing project it's a brand statement. 0:14:00.160,0:14:00.880 These locations 0:14:00.880,0:14:02.960 are usually experience driven, 0:14:02.960,0:14:05.200 help build Starbucks' premium identity, 0:14:05.200,0:14:08.720 and draw customers who value the coffee the most. 0:14:08.720,0:14:09.680 So that upside 0:14:09.680,0:14:11.440 isn't fully captured in the cashflows, 0:14:11.440,0:14:12.880 but it does matter. 0:14:12.880,0:14:14.960 So overall, the Evolve stage tells me 0:14:14.960,0:14:17.040 that this project is financially attractive 0:14:17.040,0:14:18.080 in the base case 0:14:18.080,0:14:21.920 and strategically consistent with Starbucks' branding, 0:14:21.920,0:14:23.200 but it becomes risky 0:14:23.200,0:14:25.120 if revenues underperform. 0:14:25.120,0:14:30.160 So the revenue sensitivity is the biggest swing factor, 0:14:30.160,0:14:35.920 and that will be a key part of my final recommendation. 0:14:35.920,0:14:37.600 So let's move on to the last part, 0:14:37.600,0:14:39.440 which is the reflection. 0:14:39.440,0:14:41.360 So based on the result of my analysis, 0:14:41.360,0:14:43.040 the project should be accepted. 0:14:43.040,0:14:47.360 The base case NPV is positive at about 3.02 million, 0:14:47.360,0:14:50.400 and the IRR is roughly around 13.3%, 0:14:50.400,0:14:53.840 which is well above Starbucks' 8.5% WACC. 0:14:53.840,0:14:56.800 The profitability index of 1.24 also shows 0:14:56.800,0:14:57.920 that the project generates 0:14:57.920,0:15:02.560 strong value per dollar invested. 0:15:02.560,0:15:04.640 While the sensitivity analysis reveals 0:15:04.640,0:15:06.560 the project becomes unattractive 0:15:06.560,0:15:08.480 if revenue falls by 20%, 0:15:08.480,0:15:10.560 the discount rate sensitivity shows 0:15:10.560,0:15:12.160 that it remains value creating 0:15:12.160,0:15:14.080 even at higher WACC levels. 0:15:14.080,0:15:14.640 overall, 0:15:14.640,0:15:16.720 the base case is financially solid 0:15:16.720,0:15:19.040 and the project also carries strategy benefits 0:15:19.040,0:15:22.320 such as improving Starbucks' premium brand and customer experience. 0:15:22.320,0:15:24.160 Even with the revenue risk in mind, 0:15:24.160,0:15:27.120 the financial strategy evidence shows that this is a very, 0:15:27.120,0:15:29.600 very good investment for Starbucks. 0:15:29.600,0:15:30.720 So, in this project, 0:15:30.720,0:15:32.000 it helps me understand 0:15:32.000,0:15:34.480 how a real investment decision works. 0:15:34.480,0:15:36.480 I learned how revenue, cost, taxes, 0:15:36.480,0:15:38.080 and working capital are linked together 0:15:38.080,0:15:39.520 to create free cash flows, 0:15:39.520,0:15:40.960 and then how those cash flows 0:15:40.960,0:15:44.480 turn into NPV, IR, and payback. 0:15:44.480,0:15:47.040 The sensitivity part stood out to me the most, 0:15:47.040,0:15:48.480 because when I drop the revenue 0:15:48.480,0:15:50.480 by 20%- The project went from good 0:15:50.480,0:15:52.000 to bad very fast, 0:15:52.000,0:15:52.880 So, I saw how big 0:15:52.880,0:15:54.560 the demand risk is. 0:15:54.560,0:15:56.720 Using Python also made me more confident 0:15:56.720,0:15:57.920 with doing calculation 0:15:57.920,0:16:00.800 and making charts instead of doing everything by hand. 0:16:00.800,0:16:04.160 The driver method also keep- kept me organized. 0:16:04.160,0:16:06.480 First of all is let me understand the problem, 0:16:06.480,0:16:07.680 and then build a model, 0:16:07.680,0:16:10.000 and then check it and interpret it. 0:16:10.000,0:16:10.720 so in the end, 0:16:10.720,0:16:12.560 I feel I can not only get the numbers, 0:16:12.560,0:16:13.840 but also explain what makes 0:16:13.840,0:16:16.400 this project strong and why it is risky. 0:16:16.400,0:16:18.000 And that's all I got for today. 0:16:18.000,0:16:21.440 Thank you for listening.",
