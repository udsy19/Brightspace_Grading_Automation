  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by constructing free cash flows, including the initial $12.5M outlay, and discounting at the stated WACC to obtain a specific NPV, then tested sensitivity to discount rates and verified consistency via IRR. Multiple stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) showed strong conceptual and applied grasp, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0 at the hurdle rate) and demonstrates it with base-case acceptance and a revenue-down scenario yielding rejection. They further validate the rule via NPV–discount rate analysis and IRR cross-checks, showing thorough, accurate understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR but explicitly validated the core definition that IRR is the discount rate making NPV equal to zero and corroborated it with an NPV-profile plot. They further applied IRR in sensitivity and decision analysis, demonstrating a thorough, accurate, and well-validated understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognized and included both terminal/salvage value (after tax) and working capital recovery (tax neutral) at the project end, and showed their impact on Year 10 free cash flow. However, they did not thoroughly detail the after-tax salvage computation (e.g., book value vs. proceeds, taxes) or provide supporting calculations beyond noting a ~$3M terminal value. This shows correct but basic treatment, hence Partial.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly constructed and ran a base case and a clear downside scenario and performed WACC sensitivity, demonstrating personal execution and validation. However, they did not present an explicit best/optimistic revenue scenario (or a full best/base/worst set), so scenario modeling is incomplete — thus PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates strong internal validation (consistency checks and sensitivity to WACC/revenue) but provides no named external calculators, websites, or third-party comparisons as required by the criterion. Under the category-specific standard (external validation required for PASS), this absence means the criterion is not met.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented many assumptions (upfront cost, working capital, depreciation, operating cost breakdown) and incorporated them into the model (Discover/Represent) and validation checks. However, they relied on assignment-provided figures and did not justify or validate the $12M construction/real-estate cost or explain why chosen cost items/levels are appropriate, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
