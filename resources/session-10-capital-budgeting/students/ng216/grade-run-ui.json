  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed the required base-case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue down 20% and several WACC levels), quantified effects on NPV/IRR, and explicitly flagged that a 20% revenue decline flips the project to negative value—meeting the breakpoint requirement. Treatment is clear, specific, and interpreted strategically, satisfying a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Python model and fed the free cash flows into helper functions (Implement) and shows a clear Represent stage linking assumptions to the cashflow engine. They performed concrete validation steps (recomputing NPV at the calculated IRR and plotting/inspecting cashflows), demonstrating that outputs were checked and matched expectations. These elements meet the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly narrates multiple visuals (tables, graphs, bar charts), states magnitudes and units (“million”), and clearly explains scenarios (base vs. -20% revenue, varying WACC). These descriptions make the outputs interpretable and highlight trade-offs under different capital allocation assumptions, satisfying the criterion at a strong level across DRIVER stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and generic WACC sensitivity, not on the capital structure trade-off between tax shields and distress/flexibility across payout/deleveraging alternatives, and it does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet/risk. Given the absence of quantification of tax advantages versus distress/optionality costs and no Apple-specific discussion, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion identifies who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the criterion and moderate standard allowing conceptual discussion, the complete omission warrants a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs. equity financing would affect ROE/EPS volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk; no coverage metrics are presented. While WACC is mentioned, the analysis avoids financing structure implications and emphasizes operational risk, leaving this criterion unaddressed.",
