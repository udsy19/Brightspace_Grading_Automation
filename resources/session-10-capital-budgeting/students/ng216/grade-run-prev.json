  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly calculated NPV by constructing free cash flows that include the initial investment and discounting them at the WACC, reporting specific NPV results across multiple discount rates. They also validated the computation behaviorally (IRR back-check and NPV curve), demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding. Hence, this meets a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule—accept when NPV > 0 at the hurdle rate and reject when NPV < 0—and does so thoroughly across base and sensitivity cases. They explicitly tie the decision to the 8.5% WACC, compute NPV, and make an accept call, while also discussing a negative-NPV scenario, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR but rigorously validated that it is the discount rate making NPV ≈ 0, and corroborated it graphically. The Implement and Validate stages together show thorough understanding and correct application, meeting a comprehensive standard for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly constructs project free cash flows that are largely incremental: initial capex plus working capital outlay and recovery, operating cash flows based on EBIT (no financing), and an after-tax terminal value. However, the treatment is basic; they do not discuss key incremental considerations such as cannibalization of existing store sales, opportunity costs, or exclusion of non-incremental overhead/sunk costs. Given the moderate standard, this shows sound but not thorough mastery, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and conceptually treats terminal value as after-tax and NWC recovery as tax-neutral, and integrates both into the terminal-year cash flow, showing understanding across DRIVER stages. However, the treatment is basic: no explicit after-tax salvage calculation (e.g., proceeds vs. book value, tax on recapture) or numerical detail supporting the $3M after-tax figure. This satisfies a correct but not thorough treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly executed and validated the model personally (base case metrics, IRR verification) and implemented scenario/sensitivity runs (revenue -20% and multiple WACCs) with interpretation. However, they did not explicitly present a best/optimistic revenue scenario (best/base/worst required by this criterion), so the scenario-modeling requirement is only partially satisfied.",

      "driver_alignment": "Define/Discover — clearly stated the decision question and laid out inputs/assumptions; Represent — turned assumptions into an explicit cashflow table and tied each line to formulas; Implement — coded NPV/IRR/payback and sensitivity analyses; Validate — performed sanity checks (IRR→NPV consistency, cashflow profile); Evolve/Reflect — interpreted financial and strategic implications and provided a recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student systematically applied and documented each DRIVER stage, explained assumptions and modeling choices, and illustrated results with concrete numbers and sensitivity examples. Coverage is detailed and organized, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS."
