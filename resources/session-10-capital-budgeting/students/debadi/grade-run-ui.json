  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus at least one explicit sensitivity (revenue -20%), showed quantitative outcomes (NPV and IRR deterioration), and produced a WACC sweep that identifies the breakpoint (NPV crossing zero ~13–14%)—thereby highlighting where stakeholder preference (accept/reject) shifts. This is a thorough, decision-focused sensitivity analysis consistent with the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code (called build_cash_flows, printed results) and reports concrete outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) while describing assumptions and logic that map to those results. They also describe validation steps (smell test and sensitivity runs), demonstrating both execution and reasonable verification.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what each visualization/table shows, specifies axes, ranges, and scenarios (base vs -20% revenue), and ties the NPV–WACC curve to financing/capital allocation trade-offs. Multiple visuals are described with units and results, meeting a thorough, conceptually clear standard under a moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off, provide any quantification of tax shield benefits or expected distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, or tie conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Aside from a brief generic note linking WACC to capital structure, the required criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under financing choices, or agency issues like asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. It focuses on capital budgeting mechanics and WACC sensitivity only. Hence it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses or computes DFL, EPS/ROE impacts, or how debt choice changes volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The brief capital-structure note via WACC sensitivity is superficial and does not meet the depth required for this criterion.
