  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains constructing free cash flows, subtracting the initial investment, discounting at WACC, and summing to compute NPV, with explicit assumptions and mechanics. They validate with reported NPV, sensitivity analysis, and the NPV–IRR relationship, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding. The DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages are clearly evidenced and support the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule, correctly tying positive NPV to acceptance and interpreting negative NPV as value destruction. They apply it in the base case and under sensitivity, and connect the NPV zero crossing to IRR, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect/Evolve stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes IRR using a root-finding (bisection) approach and ties it to the definition via the NPV–rate curve crossing zero. They provide numerical results for the base and downside scenarios and validate alignment with the zero-crossing, demonstrating thorough, conceptually sound treatment suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of inflows divided by initial investment and reports a result, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, treatment is brief with no detailed derivation, numerical breakdown of PV inflows, or deeper discussion, which falls short of the thoroughness needed for a PASS under this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both working capital recovery at project end and an after-tax terminal value, and implements them in the model, showing sound conceptual grasp. However, the treatment is basic: they do not detail how the after-tax salvage was derived (e.g., tax on sale vs. book value) or provide deeper justification/calculation, so it lacks the depth needed for a PASS under this criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented and ran a base case and a downside (-20% revenue) scenario and shows code-level ownership (build_cash_flows, storing outputs, comparison table), satisfying partial scenario modeling. However, they did not explicitly present or run a clear best/upside case (only base and downside), so the requirement of best/base/worst cases is not fully met.",

However, justification for the $12M capex and other cost choices relies on a brief \"smell test\" and classroom-consistency comment rather than deeper benchmarking or empirical validation, so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly justified."
