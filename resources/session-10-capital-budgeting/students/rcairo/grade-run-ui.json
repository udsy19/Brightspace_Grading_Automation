  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides explicit execution evidence (visualization, placed inputs, ran sensitivity scenarios) and reports precise computed outputs. They explain key assumptions and connect how changes (revenue/WACC) alter NPV/IRR, demonstrating validation of results against expectations.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states that Define & Discover was the first step, lists all project givens and required deliverables, and documents initializing variables before computing depreciation and cash flows. This shows the D-stage was completed and recorded prior to modeling, meeting the strict DRIVER requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined required data, models, metrics, and scenarios before implementation and then produced corresponding artifacts (schedules, chart, NPV/IRR calculations, scenario runs). This demonstrates a systematic representation of approach and a direct linkage from plan to implemented outputs, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off, provide tax shield vs. distress/flexibility cost quantification for buyback/dividend/debt reduction, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Work centers on project evaluation and sensitivities (and even references Starbucks), not Apple’s capital allocation choices, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the absence across all DRIVER stages, it fails this criterion even under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses financial leverage math (DFL) or its impact on EPS/ROE volatility, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The only financing-related content is WACC sensitivity, which is not a substitute for leverage analysis. Given these omissions, the criterion is not met.",
