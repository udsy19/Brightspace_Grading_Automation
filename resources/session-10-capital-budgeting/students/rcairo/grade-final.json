  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the NPV decision rule—accept when NPV > 0—and justifies acceptance by linking positive NPV to shareholder value creation, then deepens this by analyzing how NPV changes under revenue and WACC scenarios and interpreting attractiveness accordingly. This shows a strong, applied understanding beyond a surface mention, supported across Implement and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed an IRR and applied it across scenarios, correctly noting that IRR is unaffected by changes in the discount rate and interpreting it relative to WACC. This shows solid conceptual understanding and practical application within the cash-flow model, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately determined both simple (7.43 years) and discounted (9.22 years) payback, described the correct methodology using cumulative (discounted) cash flows and fractional-year interpolation, and interpreted the implications relative to project life. This goes beyond a basic mention and demonstrates solid conceptual understanding and application, meeting the PASS standard for a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of NPV as discounted cash flows (using WACC) applied to a full project cash flow schedule and analyzes sensitivity to revenue and WACC. However, the NPV formula is imprecisely described and the reported NPV magnitude is implausible given the stated cash flows, indicating accuracy issues. This supports a correct but incomplete treatment, meriting PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and calculated the profitability index using PI = (NPV + initial outlay) / initial outlay and interpreted PI > 1 appropriately. However, treatment is basic: no explicit breakdown of PV benefits or nuance on components of the initial outlay (e.g., working capital), and minor terminology confusion (“future value” vs. present value). This shows correct conceptual understanding but not the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows the correct OCF structure via NOPAT + depreciation, which is equivalent to EBIT × (1–T) + depreciation, indicating conceptual understanding. However, phrasing is ambiguous (“NOAD minus or NOAD plus”), taxes are described vaguely, and there’s no detailed numeric demonstration of the OCF calculation. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but basic, so PARTIAL.",
