  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined inputs, described the NPV computation process using discounted ICFs at the WACC, and reported specific NPV results plus sensitivity impacts. Multiple applications (base case and revenue/WACC sensitivities) and clear linkage to decision-making show thorough, accurate treatment consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule (positive NPV → accept; negative NPV → reject), ties it to the appropriate discount rate (WACC), and demonstrates it with base-case and downside scenarios. The discussion is specific, applies results to a decision, and reflects on conditions under which the decision changes, meeting the thoroughness needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero and applies it in the base case and a downside sensitivity, comparing it to the hurdle rate. Evidence spans implementation details, validation of results, and reflective sensitivity insights, indicating thorough and correct conceptual understanding suitable for a PASS in a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission provides no calculation, description, or conceptual discussion of the payback period or the time to recover the $12.5M initial outlay. While the model and results thoroughly address NPV/IRR and sensitivities, the payback metric is absent across the DRIVER stages. Under the rubric, this omission results in a FAIL for this specific criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never calculates or conceptually discusses the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While initial investment and NPV/IRR are presented, there is no PI formula, value, or interpretation in any DRIVER stage. Given the omission, this criterion fails under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains OCF and recognizes initial capex and NWC, showing conceptual grasp. However, they do not explicitly demonstrate free cash flow as OCF less ongoing capital expenditures and working capital changes (including terminal recovery), so the treatment is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.",
