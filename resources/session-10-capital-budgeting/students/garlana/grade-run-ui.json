  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case and multiple sensitivity runs (revenue multipliers and WACC), quantitatively shows the breakpoint (20% revenue decline flips NPV/IRR), and ties that breakpoint to a conditional recommendation. This thorough, specific scenario analysis meets the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the Python/Colab code, pointed to console output of the 10-year ICF array, and reported numeric MPV/IRR results tied to stated assumptions and formulas (OCF, depreciation, WACC). The submission also includes sensitivity analysis validating the outputs, demonstrating thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the tables/graphs show, citing specific values (NPV in dollars, IRR in percent) and scenarios (revenue 0.80x; WACC at 6.5%, 8.5%, 10.5%). This verbal walkthrough of visuals demonstrates understanding of capital allocation trade-offs under different assumptions. Coverage is detailed across base-case and sensitivity outputs, satisfying a thorough PASS under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project NPV/IRR and operating tax effects (depreciation) for a Starbucks project, not on capital structure trade-offs. It does not quantify tax shield benefits of leverage, distress/optionality costs, or evaluate alternatives across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor does it reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no substantive discussion of agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. While the DRIVER stages are applied to valuation and sensitivity, they do not address the required agency-incentive analysis, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE effects, or how financing choice changes downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It focuses on operating sensitivity and NPV/IRR under WACC, leaving the leverage criterion unaddressed.",
