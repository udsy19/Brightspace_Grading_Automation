  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule, applies it with the correct hurdle rate (WACC), and demonstrates acceptance when NPV > 0 and rejection when NPV < 0 across scenarios. Their reflection ties positive NPV to shareholder value, showing solid conceptual understanding beyond a surface mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulated the correct OCF formula as EBIT × (1–T) + Depreciation and demonstrated it with a concrete Year 1 calculation, verifying with code. This shows strong conceptual understanding and applied accuracy across DRIVER stages, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly modeled depreciation (straight‑line 1.2M) in EBIT, applied the 25% tax rate to get NOPAT, and correctly added back depreciation to compute OCF, then ran code and validated year‑1 results against manual calculations—meeting the strict requirement for personal execution and block‑by‑block logic.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct NPV methodology and applies it using the stated WACC, initial outlay, and cash flow components, showing conceptual understanding. However, conflicting NPV results (2.69M vs 2.5M) and additional inconsistencies elsewhere (e.g., terminal value noted as 3M vs 30M, tax treatment) undermine accuracy. Given moderate strictness, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR and used it correctly against the hurdle rate, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain or demonstrate that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, showed inconsistent IRR figures (12.87% vs 12.6%), and provided no detailed computation or verification. Thus, coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a discounted payback period and linked it to the project life, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief with no calculation detail, cumulative cash flow timeline, or comparison to simple payback/thresholds. Depth is insufficient for a PASS under the moderate standard.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents key real-estate/construction cost assumptions (initial investment, depreciation, working capital, recurring costs) and uses them in the model (Discover/Implement). However, they do not justify or validate those cost choices (no sources, cost breakdown, market comparables, or rationale), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
