  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (−20% revenue, higher WACC, alternative discount cases) with numeric NPVs and IRRs, and explicitly identified a downside revenue scenario that flips the recommendation. That demonstrates multiple, specific sensitivity tests and highlights where stakeholder preference (accept vs reject) changes, meeting the criterion for a thorough sensitivity analysis under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student ran multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC at 10.5% and 6.5%), presented resulting NPVs, and explained implications for risk and recommendation. While not covering tax rate or buyback timing, the modeled scenarios and explicit linkage to decision-making meet the moderate standard for thorough sensitivity/stress testing.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript clearly documents the Discover stage (problem, objectives, inputs, decision rule) before describing the representation and implementation of the cash-flow model. Because the D-stage is explicit and precedes modeling, the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, provide quantitative tax shield vs financial distress/flexibility costs, or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also fails to connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, the work remains a Starbucks project NPV analysis, not the required capital structure evaluation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across stakeholders and no explanation of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage/buybacks. Even under moderate strictness, only shareholder-centric capital budgeting was discussed, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss leverage mechanics (DFL), EPS/ROE sensitivity to financing choice, or downside/bankruptcy risk via interest/coverage metrics. Risk treatment is limited to operating and WACC sensitivity, not financial leverage. Hence, it fails the criterion.",
