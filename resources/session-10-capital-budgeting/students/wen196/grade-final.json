  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting by using AI-generated code in Colab to produce core metrics (NPV, IRR, PI) and full cash-flow components, and they addressed corrections like working capital and terminal cash flow. They also performed and interpreted a sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough, technology-enabled treatment beyond surface-level discussion, which meets the PASS threshold for a moderate category.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student uses a structured capital budgeting framework: clearly identifying inputs (investment, working capital, revenues, costs), applying WACC, and computing NPV, IRR, and PI to drive an accept/reject decision, plus terminal and working capital considerations. They further stress-test assumptions with sensitivity analysis. Despite some minor confusion, the treatment is thorough and systematic, meeting PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the investment problem, listed the necessary inputs, and identified the decision rule (compare NPV/IRR to WACC). They also applied those criteria (reported NPV and IRR exceeding the WACC), demonstrating a clear and explicit Define & Discover stage per the DRIVER requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly referenced NPV, used WACC, and reported a positive NPV with an accept/reject decision, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they relied on AI for the calculation and admitted multiple gaps (working capital, taxes/EBIT, terminal cash flow), with little explanation of discounting or the NPV mechanics. This supports a correct but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies the NPV decision rule in practice by citing a positive NPV and concluding the project should be accepted, and they reference sensitivity that still supports acceptance. However, the explanation is brief, mixed with reliance on IRR/PI, and shows confusion about related calculations, lacking a thorough articulation of the NPV accept/reject rule. This demonstrates correct but basic understanding, fitting a PARTIAL score under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly reported an IRR and applied the accept rule (IRR > WACC), showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, and showed confusion in related cash flow/NPV reasoning. Thus, understanding is present but not thorough.",
