You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student named and used an external tool (Gemini/Colab) to check calculations, reported specific results (NPV, IRR), and performed a sensitivity check (5% revenue drop) that supported the decision—meeting the moderate validation standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss, quantify, or compare tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on project evaluation (WACC, NPV, IRR) for Starbucks, with admitted uncertainty on basic tax elements. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of shareholder vs bondholder/management/employee incentives, who gains or loses, or how leverage/buybacks create asset substitution and risk-shifting. It focuses solely on capital budgeting metrics and implementation details. Under the moderate standard, some conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is entirely missing, so the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR and revenue sensitivity, with no discussion of financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice changes ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics, and the student admits not including EBIT, which is foundational for DFL and interest coverage. Thus, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
