  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately described NPV as the discounted sum of cash flows and explicitly included the initial outlay and working capital in year 0. They applied the calculation with a stated discount rate, detailed terminal adjustments, and provided multiple NPV results under base and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating thorough understanding suitable for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of the NPV decision rule by explicitly rejecting scenarios with negative NPV, recognizing NPV=0 as the break-even threshold, and proceeding when NPV is positive, supported by sensitivity and robustness checks. Multiple applications (base case, downside, break-even) and explicit decision statements satisfy a thorough, concept-driven treatment suitable for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR values for the base and sensitivity scenarios and explicitly tied IRR to the break-even discount rate relative to WACC, demonstrating understanding that IRR is the rate at which NPV equals zero. The implementation details and comparative analysis show thorough, applied grasp suitable for a moderate strictness standard, despite minor terminology errors.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported a payback period (5.28 years) and referenced cumulative cash flow/payback timeline, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, they did not provide a detailed method, intermediate figures, or explicit demonstration of how the 5.28 years was derived, nor specifics for discounted payback. This meets a correct but basic treatment, not the thorough level required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not mention or compute the Profitability Index, nor does it conceptually explain “present value of benefits divided by initial investment.” While NPV, IRR, and payback are covered, PI is entirely absent across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly modeled major incremental cash-flow components (initial outlay, NWC investment and recovery, after-tax salvage) and acknowledged cannibalization, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly discuss exclusions (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead) or opportunity costs, and did not comprehensively justify that all included items are incremental.

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: stated key project parameters (12M capex, premium downtown location, WACC 8.5%).\n- Implement: encoded assumptions (working capital, salvage, depreciation, revenues/costs) into the financial model and ran sensitivity scenarios.\n- Reflect: discussed strategic implications and recommended negotiating lease terms to mitigate risk.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents many numeric assumptions (capex, WC, salvage, WACC) and implements them in the model (Discover/Implement), demonstrating understanding. However, they do not adequately justify why specific values were chosen (e.g., rationale for $500k WC, $3M salvage, or the 12M capex breakdown), so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL."

      "reasoning": "The student provides a thorough, organized explanation covering project discovery, implementation of assumptions and code, detailed financial metrics (NPV/IRR/payback), sensitivity analysis, and strategic reflection. Quotes show explicit DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages and demonstrate a strong conceptual and applied grasp that meets the PASS standard."
