  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue ±20%, WACC +/- 200 bps), generates numeric NPV/IRR outcomes, and explicitly identifies breakpoints (11.3% revenue decline to NPV=0 and WACC/IRR thresholds). REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT/VALIDATE stages are evidenced by the cash‑flow model, coded sensitivity loop, and reported results, meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes implementing assumptions in code, executing the model (printing base and sensitivity scenarios), and reports specific numeric outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) along with interpretation of those results. Their explanations link assumptions and logic to the observed outputs (e.g., terminal value, depreciation, sensitivity findings), satisfying the criterion for verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student embedded sensitivity/stress testing in the model and analyzed multiple key drivers (revenue, costs via fixed-cost assumptions, WACC, and break-even revenue). They clearly explained how results change the accept/reject decision and risk profile. This is thorough and meets the criterion under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of the capital structure trade-off, no quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs, and no comparison of buyback/dividend/debt reduction. It also fails to connect any conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. Hence, it does not meet the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different financing options. It also lacks any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. While DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT are evident for valuation, they do not cover this criterion, so the student fails it.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage or DFL, nor how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk. There is no discussion of bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The work focuses on project valuation (NPV/IRR) and operating/revenue sensitivity, leaving the leverage criterion unaddressed.",
