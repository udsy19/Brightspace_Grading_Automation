  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the code in Google Colab and iteratively fixed errors, and they report concrete outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) tied to documented assumptions and functions. This shows both verbal confirmation of running the code and explanation of logic/results sufficient for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Discover stage (project overview, scope, hurdle rate, decision objective) before describing model construction and implementation. Assumptions are stated as constants \"at the onset,\" showing Define/Discover completion prior to modeling, satisfying the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission clearly specified models, scenarios, parameters, and metrics before coding (assumptions, cash-flow plan, WACC/scenario definitions) and then implemented corresponding artifacts (custom NPV/IRR functions, FCF schedule, sensitivity tests and visualizations). This demonstrates systematic representation and linkage from plan to implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure choices, tax shield benefits, expected distress/optionality costs, or trade-offs, and it makes no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. All evidence centers on project NPV/IRR modeling for Starbucks, so the required criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR modeling and sensitivity but contains no analysis of stakeholder agency conflicts or incentives, and no mention of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. Given the absence of any conceptual or applied discussion on the specified criterion, it does not meet the moderate standard for understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or explain DFL, and does not address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Content centers on project cash flows, NPV/IRR, and WACC sensitivity, which is unrelated to the required leverage analysis. Under the moderate standard, the absence of conceptual treatment of leverage effects results in a fail.",
