  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV-based decision rule tied to the hurdle rate and applies it to the computed results, explicitly concluding rejection due to negative NPV. They also support the decision with sensitivity outcomes, demonstrating a strong, applied understanding. Minor inconsistencies in sign notation do not undermine the correct and thorough application of the rule in a moderate evaluation setting.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and described a correct numerical method (Newton-Raphson) to compute it, indicating strong conceptual and computational understanding. They computed and reported IRR (8.13%) and used it in decision-making relative to the hurdle rate, demonstrating thorough application.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code in Colab, describes block-by-block how the NPV and IRR routines work (including Newton–Raphson and derivative), and reports concrete output values, demonstrating personal execution, understanding, and ownership. These satisfy the strict Technical Implementation requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described how NPV is computed (discount cash flows at WACC and apply the standard formula) and applied it to the project, demonstrating conceptual understanding and implementation. However, inconsistent reporting of the base-case NPV’s sign indicates a gap in accuracy/clarity, preventing a thorough, error-free treatment required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual understanding by computing both simple and discounted payback and mentioning linear interpolation, with specific results provided. However, the discounted payback values are inconsistent (9.28 years vs. 0), and there’s limited explanation of the calculation process (e.g., cumulative cash flow logic), so the treatment is basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student incorrectly defines the PV of benefits as “NPV minus initial outlay,” whereas it should be NPV plus initial outlay, or equivalently PV of inflows divided by initial outflow. Despite reporting a plausible PI value (0.98), the stated methodology reflects a conceptual error in the criterion. Given this accuracy-focused criterion, the mis-specified formula leads to a fail.",
