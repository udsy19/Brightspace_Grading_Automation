  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough and accurate application of NPV: they model cash flows including initial outlay at t=0, compute NPV using the cost of capital, and verify by summing discounted cash flows to match the code output. They extend this with sensitivity analysis and interpretation (accept/reject threshold), showing depth beyond a basic mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0) and applies it to the base case and scenario analysis, including explicit accept/reject thresholds. Multiple concrete applications (base case, sensitivity to revenue, NPV vs. WACC threshold) demonstrate thorough understanding, meeting the PASS standard under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly identified and used only project-driven cash flows: initial capex plus WC at t0, operating revenues and costs, non-cash depreciation handled via tax shield, taxes, WC recovery, and terminal value—without introducing financing flows. Their Implement stage explicitly framed a “year zero incremental cash flow schedule” and applied it consistently, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp suitable for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and applied IRR in the analysis and correctly noted its independence from the cost of capital, indicating basic conceptual understanding. However, they inaccurately defined IRR as “basically just the annual rate of return” and did not articulate that IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV zero, nor did they treat it in depth. Under the moderate standard, this supports a correct but incomplete treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly distinguishes simple vs. discounted payback and indicates they computed both, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide the actual payback times or a detailed cumulative cash flow demonstration, keeping the treatment basic. Under a moderate standard, this supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the profitability index as PV of future cash flows divided by the initial investment and provided a reasonable interpretation (~1.35 per $1), indicating conceptual understanding. However, they did not show a detailed calculation (e.g., components of PV benefits, inclusion of working capital/terminal value) or explore PI sensitivity/implications in depth.

      "reasoning": "The student correctly stated core real-estate/construction cost assumptions (capex amount, straight-line depreciation, inclusion of equipment/training, working capital) and ran sensitivity tests, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly document justification or validation of those cost figures (no cost breakdown, market/comps, contingencies, or sourcing), so the treatment is correct but incomplete. Hence PARTIAL."
