  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and ±2% cost of capital), produced a heat map, and explicitly identified the breakpoint (≈20% revenue shortfall) that flips NPV negative and thus stakeholder preference. The depth and concrete scenario analysis meet the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code, inspecting outputs (tables and plots), and performing a verification step where the summed discounted cash flows matched the code's NPV. They also explain key assumptions (depreciation tax shield, working capital recovery) and connect that logic to the reported results, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly described what each visualization/table shows, cited key units (millions of dollars, percentages) and scenarios (−20% revenue, ±2% cost of capital), and drew accept/reject implications. Multiple visuals (cash flow table/plot, NPV metrics chart, sensitivity curve, heat map) were interpreted in depth, meeting the moderate standard for thoroughness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs (tax shield of debt vs. distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction. It also does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Discussion of depreciation tax shields is project-level, not capital structure, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss who gains/loses across stakeholder groups, nor why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Given the total absence of the required agency-conflict analysis across all DRIVER stages, the criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, provide DFL math, or discuss downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. While risk and WACC sensitivity are covered, leverage-specific analysis is missing across Discover, Implement, and Reflect, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
