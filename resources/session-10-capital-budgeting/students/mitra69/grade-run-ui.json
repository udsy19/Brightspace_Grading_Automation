  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base-case NPV and ran at least two sensitivities (revenue shock and discount-rate change), quantified their impacts, and identified the breakpoint where project acceptance flips (20% revenue drop → NPV negative, IRR below hurdle). They also discussed operational implications and mitigation, showing thorough scenario and sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the generated Python code and reports concrete outputs (NPV, IRR) and sensitivity results. They also verbally tie key assumptions (depreciation, tax rate, terminal salvage, revenue scenarios) to the observed outputs, demonstrating valid execution and logical validation of results.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the displayed outputs show, citing specific figures, units (USD, percentages), and scenarios (base case, sensitivity), effectively “talking to” the chart/table. They also tie the visual insights to capital allocation trade-offs (liquidity/payback, rent variability, upfront marketing). This is thorough and meets the moderate-standard requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires analyzing the capital structure trade-off, quantifying tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, and tying conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. The submission centers on a Starbucks project NPV and depreciation tax shield, with no discussion or quantification of interest tax shields, financial distress/optionality costs, or Apple-specific capital structure. Thus, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. It focuses exclusively on NPV/cash-flow modeling and sensitivity, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage and NPV/WACC sensitivity but does not analyze financial leverage (DFL), EPS/ROE volatility under different financing choices, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Given the criterion requires leverage math and risk implications of debt vs equity, the absence of DFL/EPS/ROE and coverage analysis results in a FAIL despite otherwise solid project evaluation work.",
