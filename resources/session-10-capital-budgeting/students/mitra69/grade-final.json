  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately constructed cash flows (initial outlay, operating cash flows with depreciation tax shield, and terminal salvage/working capital recovery) and applied an 8.5% discount rate to calculate a positive NPV, stating the accept/reject rule. Inclusion of implementation via code and sensitivity analysis shows depth beyond basics, satisfying a thorough treatment under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule, including the indifferent case, and applies it to the project with a positive NPV leading to acceptance. They further validate understanding by examining scenarios where NPV would turn negative. This comprehensive, applied treatment meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly demonstrated free cash flow construction by detailing OCF (EBIT(1−t)+Dep), explicitly subtracting CapEx and incorporating working capital changes (initial outflow and terminal recovery), and applying these to the NPV. The discussion includes concrete numbers and implications (e.g., Year 1 OCF due to depreciation), meeting the moderate standard’s requirement for depth and application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (13.25%) and used it in decision-making, and they referenced IRR behavior under sensitivity. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail how it was computed, and they explicitly focused on NPV over IRR. This reflects correct but basic treatment, consistent with a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a payback period and interprets its liquidity implication, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not detail the calculation method (simple vs. discounted) or show cumulative cash flow steps, and the phrasing of “5.28 to eight years” is unclear. This is adequate but not thorough, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports a PI (1.24x) and provides the necessary components (initial investment of $12.5M and discounted cash flow context via WACC), consistent with the reported NPV (~$3M). However, they do not explain the PI formula or show how PV of benefits was derived, making the treatment correct but basic rather than thorough.",
