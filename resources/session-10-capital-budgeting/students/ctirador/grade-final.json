  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly assembled the cash flows (including initial outlay, depreciation/taxes, working capital recovery, and terminal value), applied the 8.5% WACC, and reported/used the NPV for the accept decision. They also applied NPV in a sensitivity scenario, showing depth beyond a basic mention. While they did not show each discounting step, the conceptual accuracy and comprehensive application meet the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule, explicitly accepting when NPV > 0 and rejecting when NPV < 0, and ties this to the firm’s WACC. They demonstrate this in both base and stressed scenarios, showing solid conceptual understanding and application across DRIVER stages. This meets a thorough standard for a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed operating cash flows and integrated capital expenditures and working capital changes to derive free cash flows across periods (notably Year 0 outflows and Year 10 recovery), demonstrating accurate application of the criterion. Coverage spans multiple years with specific numbers, reflecting a thorough and conceptually sound treatment supported by the Implement stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR and provided a sensitivity case, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic: they did not explain that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation methodology, and there’s a minor inconsistency comparing the scenario IRR to 8.5% instead of the 10.5% scenario WACC. This supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and interpreted both simple and discounted payback and provided the underlying cash flows, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not demonstrate a detailed derivation, cumulative recovery walkthrough, or discuss implications/limitations or how payback influenced the decision, making the treatment correct but basic. Hence, PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and interprets the Profitability Index, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not detail how PI was calculated (i.e., PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or discuss components/assumptions, providing only the result. This is correct but basic, fitting PARTIAL under the moderate standard.",
