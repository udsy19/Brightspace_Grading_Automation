  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case (NPV = $3.02M) and at least one defined sensitivity (−20% revenue and +2% WACC) that flips the decision to reject (NPV = −$4.05M), meeting the criterion. They also contextualized the sensitivity by validating inputs against real-world data and discussed mitigation, demonstrating sufficient depth for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly indicates they obtained and used code to compute results and reports specific metric outputs (NPV, IRR, PI, payback). They also verbally walk through key assumptions (depreciation, taxable income, cash flow treatment) that explain and align with the reported results, and compare outcomes to real-world benchmarks, satisfying the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented the planned models, metrics, and sensitivity scenarios before coding and created a cash-flow representation of needed data. They then implemented those plans (code calculating NPV, IRR, PI, paybacks and scenario run), showing clear linkage from plan to artifacts across Represent → Implement stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze buybacks/dividends/debt reduction or quantify leverage tax shields versus distress/optionality costs, nor does it tie conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The lone mention of a “tax shield” concerns depreciation within a project, not capital structure.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under alternative financing/payout choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Given the absence of required concepts, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility, provides no DFL/leverage math, and omits bankruptcy or coverage metrics. Given the criterion and moderate standard allowing conceptual treatment, the absence of any leverage-focused analysis warrants a FAIL.",
