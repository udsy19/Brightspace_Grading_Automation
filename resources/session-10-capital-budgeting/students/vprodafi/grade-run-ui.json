  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the Colab notebook was run end-to-end and lists concrete validation checks (Year 0 cash flows, fixed depreciation, working-capital recovery, NPV/IRR consistency). Combined with documented assumptions and implementation details, this demonstrates a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching logic, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, objectives, and deliverables and records a clear pre-coding planning step that mapped assumptions and cash flows. There is no indication the Discover stage was done post-hoc, satisfying the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented a pre-implementation plan (models, timeline, assumptions, metrics) and then executed it via a modular script and parameter block that produced the planned cash-flow schedule and outputs, demonstrating a systematic link from the Represent stage to Implement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or quantify tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across payout/debt alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. Content is confined to a Starbucks project evaluation and depreciation tax shields, which is unrelated to the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it discuss asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The content is centered on cash-flow modeling and sensitivity analysis, leaving this criterion unaddressed. Consequently, it fails under the moderate standard despite otherwise solid valuation work.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss leverage math (DFL/EPS/ROE), volatility effects, stakeholder preferences, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. All cited risk analysis is operating/WACC sensitivity, not financing structure. Therefore, under this criterion, it fails despite a solid DRIVER process elsewhere.",
