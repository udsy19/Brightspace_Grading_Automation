  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly planned and built the life‑of‑project cash‑flow schedule, implemented it in code, and performed concrete validation checks (timing of Year 0 flows, fixed depreciation, WC recovery). These elements demonstrate personal execution, ownership, and explicit verification of accuracy, meeting the strict Technical Implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran sensitivity tests on key assumptions (revenue and WACC), showed personal execution in a Colab notebook with a parameter block and functions, and validated the directional impacts on NPV/IRR. This meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration of sensitivity analysis and ownership of the implementation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated core capital budgeting metrics via coded functions within a parameterized Colab model and demonstrated end-to-end execution, satisfying thorough integration of finance and technology. Implement and Evolve stages show practical automation (functions, parameter block, scenario analysis), going beyond conceptual discussion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly understood and applied NPV conceptually: discounting cash flows at 8.5%, including initial investment and working capital, and validating direction with IRR and sensitivity to WACC. However, they did not provide the actual NPV calculation or detailed numeric outputs, making the treatment sound but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the NPV decision rule by concluding acceptance when NPV is positive and linked NPV to WACC changes, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly state the full accept/reject/indifferent rule or illustrate a reject case, so coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct use and interpretation of IRR in the model and compares it to WACC, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide the computed IRR value, show that it sets NPV to zero, or discuss computational nuances; coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL under a moderate standard.",
