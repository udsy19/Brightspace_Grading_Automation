  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (20% revenue downside and WACC range), reported numeric outcomes, and explicitly identified a breakpoint where a 20% sales shortfall flips NPV from +$2.69M to -$3M—i.e., stakeholder preference shifts from accept to reject. The analysis is specific, quantitative, and ties sensitivity results to decision implications, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they automated and coded the model in Python and presents specific numeric outputs (NPV, IRR, after-tax salvage, year‑10 cash flow) tied to stated assumptions (WACC, depreciation, working capital), plus sensitivity tests that validate robustness. This demonstrates executed code and coherent verbal validation of results, meeting the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student repeatedly narrates what the visuals show, citing specific figures and units (WACC %, NPV $) and explicitly references a chart and its zero line. They also explain scenarios shown (WACC range), meeting both evaluation points. This is thorough and detailed enough for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure choices, tax shield benefits, financial distress/flexibility costs, or quantify these trade-offs. It also does not connect any capital structure analysis to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it fails to meet the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts across stakeholders, nor identify who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Under moderate standards, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided; the analysis remains confined to shareholder-focused NPV and operational sensitivity.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss degree of financial leverage (DFL), ROE/EPS volatility, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. References to “financing risk” are limited to WACC sensitivity, and “financial leverage” is misapplied to PI/payback. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but these elements are missing, so the criterion fails.",
