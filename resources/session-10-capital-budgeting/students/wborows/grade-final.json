  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly and correctly applied NPV: enumerating initial investment, working capital timing, depreciation tax shield, and after-tax salvage, using the 8.5% WACC, and reporting a computed NPV with interpretation. DRIVER stages show a complete workflow from setup to implementation and validation, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery beyond a basic mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applies the NPV decision rule, clearly stating acceptance when NPV > 0 and recognizing rejection implications when NPV turns negative under sensitivity. They anchor the decision to WACC, compute and interpret NPV across scenarios, and emphasize NPV as the primary criterion, demonstrating strong conceptual grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly described FCF construction by explicitly detailing operating cash flow, capital expenditures, and working capital changes, and showed how these flow into annual and terminal cash flows with specific amounts. The implementation on a 10-year timeline and the terminal-year assembly (OCF, WC recovery, after-tax salvage) demonstrate correct and comprehensive application, meeting the depth required for a PASS in this moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (12.84%) and used it in decision-making and sensitivity (also citing 3.13% under stress), showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain that IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate the computation method (e.g., showing NPV=0 at IRR or discussing root-finding/nuances). This is correct but basic, so it merits a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports both simple and discounted payback and offers a brief interpretation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain the calculation mechanics (cumulative cash flows, inclusion of working capital timing) or provide deeper analysis, so coverage is correct but basic, fitting PARTIAL under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the PI value and interprets it as PV of future cash flows per dollar invested, and identifies the initial investment components, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not show or discuss the actual calculation (numerator PV breakdown or explicit division by the initial outlay), so coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS in this criterion.",

      "reasoning": "The submission clearly documents core cost and cash-flow assumptions (capex, WC, depreciation, salvage) and follows the DRIVER stages to test sensitivity, showing conceptual understanding. However, it does not provide specific validation or justification for the $12M real estate/construction estimate (no sourcing, benchmarking, contingency, or cost breakdown), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

We immediately identified all incremental cash flow components: the initial $12 million equipment cost; a temporary but necessary $500,000 working capital outflow at time zero... the crucial terminal value in year 10...\"",

Under this stress scenario, the NPV plummets from a positive $2.69 million to a deeply negative $3 million. ... The insight we gain from this is that the project is highly sensitive to revenue risk.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clear problem framing and explicit listing of incremental cash flows and assumptions; Represent/Implement — described mapping to a 10-year timeline and automation with Python (model implementation); Validate & Evolve / Reflect — conducted sensitivity scenarios, interpreted results, and provided conditional recommendation and mitigation.",
      "reasoning": "The submission demonstrates thorough, structured communication using the DRIVER stages: it frames the problem, documents cash-flow components with specific numbers, shows implementation (Python), and presents sensitivity analysis with quantitative outcomes and managerial implications. This level of detail and interpretation meets the PASS standard for clear communication and explanation."
