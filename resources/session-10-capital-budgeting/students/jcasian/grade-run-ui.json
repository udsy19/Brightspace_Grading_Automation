  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC +/-2%), and explicitly identified a breakpoint where revenue weakness turns NPV negative and PI<1, changing the project's attractiveness. The DRIVER stages (Represent→Implement→Validate) show both technical implementation and conceptual interpretation, meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code (iterating prompts until it \"actually worked\") and cites concrete outputs (positive NPV, IRR behavior) obtained from the run. They also describe key assumptions (cash flow map, depreciation, taxes, terminal value) and multiple validation checks showing the logic matches results, which meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly describes performing Define & Discover up front, documenting assumptions in a visual map, and converting those into a cash-flow blueprint prior to implementation. There is no indication the D-stage was done post-hoc, so the criterion is fully met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the required capital structure trade-off across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, provides no quantification of tax advantages vs. distress/optionality costs, and makes no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. The only tax-related discussion is depreciation tax shield within a project, not interest tax shields from leverage. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion identifies who gains/loses under financing or payout choices, nor any mention of asset substitution or risk-shifting via leverage/buybacks. The work focuses on project cash flows and WACC sensitivity only. Given the absence of stakeholder agency analysis, this criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage mechanics (DFL), ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Discussion centers on operational leverage and WACC sensitivity, explicitly de-emphasizing financing choices. Under the moderate standard, conceptual treatment is acceptable, but the required leverage content is missing; thus, Fail.",
