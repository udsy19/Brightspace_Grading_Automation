  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV by detailing year-0 investment plus working capital, constructing free cash flows with taxes and depreciation, and discounting them at WACC with explicit recognition that year 0 is undiscounted. They report interpretation (positive NPV) and perform sensitivity checks. Across Discover, Represent, Implement, and Validate stages, the treatment is comprehensive and conceptually solid, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule, stating positive NPV adds value (accept) and showing a negative-NPV scenario that would undermine the project (reject). They demonstrated this across base and sensitivity cases and connected it to WACC-based discounting, meeting the moderate standard with thorough, applied discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and describes computing it via a bisection root-finding method, supported by manual NPV calculation. They validate convergence and explain that IRR is internal to cash flows (independent of WACC), applying it in base and sensitivity analyses. This demonstrates thorough conceptual understanding appropriate for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and models key project-only cash flows (initial capex, working capital investment and release, operating cash flows, depreciation add-back, and terminal/salvage) and separates them from EBIT, showing solid conceptual grasp. However, they do not explicitly address excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead, financing flows, cannibalization/opportunity costs), so coverage is sound but not fully thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the components of operating cash flow—EBIT drives taxes, depreciation creates a tax shield, and depreciation is added back—showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they do not explicitly present or thoroughly analyze the OCF formula EBIT × (1–T) + Depreciation with numeric examples or detailed derivation, and they simplify taxes (no loss carryforwards). This is solid but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes both salvage value and working capital recovery at project end and shows they modeled WC lockup and release, indicating conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: no specificity on salvage value magnitude or tax effects (e.g., gain/loss vs. book value), and no detailed mechanics beyond inclusion. This aligns with a correct but not thorough treatment, meriting PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (clear statement of objective and scope), Represent (conversion of assumptions into a full cash‑flow map and timeline), Implement (detailed description of the free‑cash‑flow engine, depreciation, taxes, NPV/IRR/payback calculations), Validate/Reflect (sensitivity tests, behavioral checks, and explicit reflection on implications).",
      "reasoning": "The student explains the problem, documents assumptions and timeline, describes the core code logic and finance formulas, and interprets results with concrete scenarios (base case and -20% revenue). Multiple stages (Discover, Represent, Implement, Validate, Reflect) contain specific numbers and rationale showing a thorough, well‑communicated analysis consistent with PASS criteria."
