  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base-case and multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported numeric NPVs/IRRs for each, and explicitly identified that a 20% revenue decline flips the recommendation (NPV < 0, reject). This satisfies the requirement to include base plus sensitivities and to highlight the breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states that they ran the model to compute metrics and that functions correctly apply the 8.5% discount and year-0 investment, and they report manual verification of critical cash flows and defined assumptions. This constitutes a thorough verbal confirmation of valid execution and validation under the MODERATE standard, so PASS is warranted.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly performed and documented Define/Discover up front (project goal, time horizon, investment, salvage, working capital, discount rate, tax rate, revenue assumptions) before stating \"Moving on to our represent,\" so the D-stage was completed prior to modeling. This meets the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project evaluation (Starbucks) and does not address the capital structure trade-off, buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, or Apple’s balance sheet/risk. While “tax shield” is mentioned, it pertains to depreciation in OCF, not capital structure. Therefore, required quantification and contextual linkage are missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses exclusively on project valuation and sensitivity, with no discussion of agency conflicts across stakeholders. It does not identify winners/losers, divergent incentives, or explain asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. Consequently, it fails to demonstrate the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. A brief WACC sensitivity is not a substitute for leverage math or risk metrics tied to financing choices. Therefore, it fails this criterion.",
