  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined NPV, constructed the relevant cash flows (including initial investment, depreciation/tax effects, NWC, and terminal value), and applied the WACC to compute and interpret NPV. They further demonstrated depth by providing a numeric NPV (~$1.9M) and conducting sensitivity analyses showing when NPV turns negative, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment across Discover, Implement, and Reflect.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule and applies it across base case and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating correct accept/reject logic. Coverage is thorough and contextualized within DRIVER stages, showing strong conceptual understanding and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines payback and provides both simple and discounted payback calculations (6.0 and 7.13 years), tying them to the $12.5M initial outlay. This demonstrates a solid conceptual and applied understanding aligned with Represent and Implement stages, sufficient for a thorough treatment under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero, computes an IRR (10.97%), compares it to WACC, and uses IRR in sensitivity analysis—showing solid conceptual understanding and application. However, the claim that the IRR function “applies the 8.5% discount rate” is inaccurate, indicating a conceptual lapse, and the treatment lacks deeper methodological detail. Therefore, this meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies key incremental cash flow components (initial investment, OCF via tax shield, changes in NWC, and terminal recovery), showing sound conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic: it lacks explicit discussion of exclusions (e.g., sunk/allocated costs, opportunity costs/cannibalization, financing flows) and does not present detailed year-by-year incremental cash flows in the transcript. This supports a correct but not thorough coverage, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies straight-line depreciation and references the OCF method conceptually, indicating awareness of the tax shield and the EBIT-based formulation. However, they do not explicitly compute or show OCF as EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation with numeric EBIT/tax application, limiting depth. Given the moderate standard, this reflects correct but basic treatment, warranting a PARTIAL.",
