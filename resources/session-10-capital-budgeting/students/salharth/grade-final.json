  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates accurate NPV calculation by constructing full free cash flows, including initial investment and working capital, applying the hurdle rate (implied via WACC sensitivity), and reporting a specific NPV result. The implementation details and sensitivity analysis show depth beyond a basic mention, satisfying the moderate standard for thorough treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly used Python to automate capital-budgeting metrics (NPV, IRR, PI, payback) and conducted automated sensitivity analysis, reporting concrete outputs. They also described the structured cash-flow engine and validation of automated results, demonstrating thorough, practical integration of automation beyond a surface mention.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly models distinct cash-flow phases: initial investment (Year 0), operating years, and terminal year adjustments, and validates the timing of phase-specific items. The discussion is detailed enough for a moderate standard and integrated with tooling, showing solid conceptual and practical grasp of multi-phase cash-flow modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule by linking a positive NPV at the 8.5% hurdle rate to an accept recommendation, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief and lacks a thorough articulation of the rule (e.g., explicit reject-if-negative discussion or broader implications), so it is correct but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an IRR (13.33%) and applies it by comparing to the hurdle rate, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero or detail how it was computed, nor provide deeper discussion or examples. Under moderate strictness, this is accurate but not thorough, so it earns PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly acknowledged payback analysis and implied it was computed, but provided no actual payback period, methodology (simple vs. discounted), or supporting calculation. Given the moderate standard, this shows basic understanding without depth, warranting PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
