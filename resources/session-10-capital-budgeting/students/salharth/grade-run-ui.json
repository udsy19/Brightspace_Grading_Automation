  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a clear base case and multiple sensitivities (discount-rate adjustments and a revenue downside) and explicitly identifies a breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts (revenue falling 20% flips NPV negative). The DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) show the scenario work was implemented, automated, and checked, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the code ran end-to-end and lists concrete validation checks and their outcomes, demonstrating both execution and logical consistency between assumptions and results. These statements from the IMPLEMENT and VALIDATE stages show thorough, appropriate verification, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the Discover stage (problem, objectives, parameters) before describing the modeling work, meeting the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling. Evidence shows clear, up-front D-stage specification and subsequent model implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off criterion at all: no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs, no evaluation across payout/debt choices, and no connection to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Despite DRIVER elements, they are applied to a different topic (Starbucks NPV/IRR), so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. The work remains strictly within capital budgeting metrics and sensitivity, leaving this criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, DFL, or downside/bankruptcy risk, nor does it discuss coverage metrics. It remains at the project cash-flow level with revenue sensitivity only. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided, so this criterion fails.",
