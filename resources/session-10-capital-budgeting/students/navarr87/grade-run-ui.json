  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case and multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and a WACC sweep) and quantified outcomes (NPV values), explicitly noting that a 20% revenue drop makes NPV negative — a clear breakpoint that shifts stakeholder preference from accept to reject. The Evolve, Implement, and Represent stages show both the technical execution and the interpreted implications, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the code and cites concrete outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) and describes validation checks (working-capital reconciliation, depreciation sum, terminal value treatment). These statements show both execution and that the assumptions/logic were checked and align with the reported results, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the table and chart show, specifying units (dollars, years) and scenarios (base vs stress) and interpreting the implications. Multiple visuals/outputs are described in context during Implement and Evolve, meeting both evaluation points with thoroughness suitable for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss the capital structure trade-off, does not quantify tax shield benefits or distress/flexibility costs for financing alternatives, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. It focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and operating taxes, not financing policy choices.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Focus remained on valuation mechanics and sensitivity analysis, which does not meet the criterion’s requirements.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion or calculation of financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk is provided. The work remains at an unlevered capital budgeting level (WACC-based NPV/IRR) without financing-choice analysis or coverage metrics, which is required for this criterion even under moderate standards.",
