  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by constructing economically correct cash flows, applying the stated 8.5% discount rate, and explicitly reporting NPV with sensitivity to revenue and WACC. Inclusion of working capital timing, after-tax terminal value, and references to PV via PI and discounted payback indicate thorough and accurate treatment suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly links positive NPV to value creation and bases the accept decision on the positive NPV, while also demonstrating that negative NPV under a stress case implies value destruction. This shows a strong, applied understanding of the NPV accept/reject rule across scenarios, meeting the depth expected for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly determines both simple and discounted payback periods, provides specific figures, references the discount rate used, and contextualizes recovery within the project horizon. Evidence from Implement and Validate stages supports that the underlying cash flows were constructed and checked, enabling credible payback calculations.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported and interpreted an IRR (12.84%) and related it to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate the computation method, providing only a result without depth. Under moderate strictness, this supports a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted the Profitability Index (PI = 1.22) and identified the initial outlay, showing a sound conceptual grasp. However, they did not detail the calculation (e.g., explicit PV of benefits, formula, or linkage to NPV), nor provide additional examples or sensitivity of PI, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies OCF as NOPAT (implied EBIT×(1–T)) plus depreciation and sets taxes on EBIT, demonstrating conceptual accuracy. However, they do not provide detailed numerical examples or show explicit OCF calculations within the schedule, making the treatment correct but basic rather than thorough.",

        "\"To ensure a disciplined and transparent analysis, I've utilized the DRIVER framework, Define, Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve, and Reflect.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (clear objectives and inputs defined); Represent (model class and cash-flow logic explained); Implement (code executed and schedule generated); Validate (working-capital and depreciation checks described); Evolve (sensitivity and scenario analysis with NPV/IRR results); Reflect (process lessons and recommendation).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented and communicated the DRIVER workflow end-to-end with specific assumptions, implementation details, validation checks, sensitivity results, and reflection. The depth and specificity (reproducible code, numeric results, and process lessons) meet the thoroughness required for a PASS."
