  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), reports NPVs/IRRs for each, and explicitly identifies the revenue-driven breakpoint where NPV turns negative and the decision flips — demonstrating thorough scenario and sensitivity analysis aligned with REPRESENT, IMPLEMENT, and VALIDATE stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the Define & Discover outputs (goal, hurdle rate, decision rule, cash flow givens) at the start, then proceeds to Represent and Implement sections. This meets the strict requirement that D-stage is documented before modeling, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated clear represent-stage elements (models/formulas, scenarios, and metrics) and explicitly linked them to implementation by citing code and generated cash-flow/analysis outputs (sensitivity NPVs/IRRs). This demonstrates a systematic plan-to-implementation workflow meeting the moderate DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on Starbucks project capital budgeting (NPV/IRR/sensitivity) and does not discuss buyback/dividend/debt reduction trade-offs, quantify tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs, or tie conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Given the absence of any relevant capital structure analysis, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses under alternatives. It also omits asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses leverage math (DFL) or how debt vs. equity financing would change EPS/ROE volatility or downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics (e.g., interest coverage, DSCR). Under moderate strictness, conceptual treatment would suffice, but no conceptual or quantitative leverage analysis is provided.",
