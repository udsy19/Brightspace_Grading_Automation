  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and timed all relevant cash flows (initial outlay, operating flows, terminal value, and working capital recovery), used WACC to discount, and reported NPV outcomes for base and multiple scenarios, demonstrating application and analysis. While step-by-step math wasn’t shown, the comprehensive treatment across stages and sensitivity analysis indicates a strong conceptual and applied grasp of NPV calculation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV accept rule and applies it to base and sensitivity scenarios, noting acceptance when NPV is positive and highlighting a negative-NPV case under revenue downside. They integrate these results into the Reflect stage recommendation, demonstrating solid conceptual understanding and application consistent with a thorough, PASS-level treatment.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly leveraged code to automate cash flow generation and produced a comprehensive set of capital budgeting outputs (NPV, IRR, PI, payback) plus multi-scenario sensitivity results, indicating an automated model rather than manual calculations. Given the moderate standard, the detailed outputs and scenario coverage demonstrate thorough automation sufficient for a PASS, even without the embedded code.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports and uses IRR in decision-making and sensitivity analysis, showing conceptual understanding (e.g., IRR unchanged when only WACC changes). However, they do not explain or demonstrate computing IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor show the calculation methodology. This is accurate but basic, fitting a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: They correctly identify and report both simple and discounted payback periods, indicating conceptual understanding. However, there’s no detailed calculation, cumulative cash flow timeline, or discussion of interpretation/benchmarks, making the treatment brief rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student asserts a PI of 1.35 but does not show the calculation of present value of benefits divided by initial investment. Moreover, the stated PI conflicts with their own NPV ($3M) and initial outlay ($12.5M), which imply a PI near 1.24–1.25, indicating inaccuracy.
