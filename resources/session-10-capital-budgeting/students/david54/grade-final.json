  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly constructed cash flows, explicitly included the initial investment and terminal adjustments, and used a discount rate (WACC) to compute and interpret NPV. They presented base-case NPV, tied it to the decision rule, and performed sensitivity analyses, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly stated the NPV accept/reject rule, computed and applied it in the base case, and tested it under adverse scenarios where NPV turned negative, interpreting that as value-destroying. Multiple applications across DRIVER stages demonstrate a strong, thorough grasp of when to accept or reject based on NPV, meeting the PASS threshold.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and reported both simple and discounted payback periods with specific values and an interpretation of the discounted result. Their cash flow modeling description shows how the inputs enable payback computation. Given the moderate standard, this constitutes a thorough, accurate treatment of the payback period.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies IRR, compares it to WACC, and examines sensitivity, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV zero or show any verification/derivation, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and reports a profitability index value and integrates it into the analysis workflow, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain the PI formula (present value of benefits divided by initial investment) or demonstrate how it was derived, and the reported PI is not reconciled with the stated NPV, suggesting limited rigor. This is a correct but basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the OCF formula conceptually as OCF = EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation and integrates depreciation as a non-cash add-back, showing solid understanding. However, the treatment is brief with no numerical illustration of the tax application to EBIT or example OCF, so depth and thoroughness are insufficient for a full PASS under the moderate standard.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — student explicitly listed project parameters (life, initial investment, working capital, salvage). \nValidate/Implement — student implemented the model and produced base-case metrics using those inputs but did not present external validation of the $12M construction/real-estate cost. \nEvolve/Reflect — sensitivity testing addressed revenue and WACC risk but not validation of construction cost assumptions.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented key cost assumptions (amounts, depreciation, working capital, salvage) and used the DRIVER workflow to implement and test scenarios, satisfying partial requirements. However, they did not justify or validate the $12M real estate/construction figure (no market comps, cost breakdown, bids, or contingency rationale), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

      "reasoning": "The student systematically applied DRIVER stages, documented explicit assumptions and decision rules, reported detailed base‑case metrics, and ran multiple sensitivity tests that informed a qualified recommendation. This demonstrates a thorough, well‑explained treatment meeting the PASS standard."
