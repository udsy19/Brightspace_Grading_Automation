  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran a clear base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (20% revenue shortfall and WACC variations), reported numeric impacts, and explicitly identified a revenue shortfall that flips the accept/reject decision and conditioned the recommendation accordingly. This is a thorough, actionable sensitivity analysis meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the analysis (\"terminal output\") and ties those outputs to the decision rule, demonstrating validation. They also explain model assumptions and show sensitivity results that coherently match the stated metrics, evidencing correct execution and verification.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the Define/Discover stage occurred first, documents the decision rule and key assumptions, and then describes the Represent plan and subsequent implementation. This clear, chronological demonstration satisfies the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss capital structure choices, tax shield benefits of debt, or financial distress/optionality costs, nor does it quantify these across alternatives or link them to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content is limited to project-level cash flows and sensitivity for a Starbucks investment, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor of asset substitution or risk-shifting with leverage/buybacks. All DRIVER stages are applied to valuation and sensitivity only, so the criterion is missing despite otherwise solid analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk appears. The analysis focuses on NPV/IRR and operating sensitivity (revenue, WACC) without leverage math or coverage metrics. Given the criterion requires connecting financing choice to volatility and risk, the submission does not demonstrate the required concepts.",
