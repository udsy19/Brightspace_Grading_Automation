  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue −20% and WACC ±2%), reports numeric NPVs for each scenario, and explicitly identifies the breakpoint where stakeholder preference flips (20% revenue drop → negative NPV). This is a thorough, interpreted sensitivity treatment meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the model and reports validation checks confirming key mechanics (depreciation, working capital timing, terminal value) and P&L/Cashflow items matched expectations. Combined with the Represent and Implementation descriptions of assumptions and functions, this demonstrates thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The model has built-in sensitivity capability and applies it to key drivers (revenue, WACC) with clear numerical outcomes and interpretation. The student explains how these sensitivities shift the risk profile (revenue risk dominates, financing risk is lower), satisfying the criterion with thorough, actionable analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss or quantify the capital structure trade-off, tax shields from debt, financial distress/flexibility costs, or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on Starbucks project cash flows and WACC with only a depreciation tax shield mention, which is unrelated to the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices, or asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. It remains purely a capital budgeting analysis of NPV/IRR and sensitivities, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt versus equity would change EPS/ROE volatility and downside risk, nor any coverage/bankruptcy risk considerations. It focuses on project cash flows and WACC-based valuation only, which does not meet this criterion.",
