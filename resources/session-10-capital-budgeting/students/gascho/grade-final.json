You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student modeled full project cash flows and explicitly computed NPV using the specified WACC, reporting precise results and interpreting them. Sensitivity analyses on WACC and revenue further demonstrate depth and application, meeting a thorough standard for NPV accuracy under the moderate evaluation criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student demonstrates a strong grasp of the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV > 0, reject when NPV < 0, using the correct hurdle rate. They provide specific NPV results across base and sensitivity scenarios and tie them to accept/reject implications, showing thorough application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly and correctly describes FCF construction as operating cash flow (EBIT, taxes, depreciation add-back) less capital expenditures (the $12M initial outlay) and working capital changes, with terminal value and WC recovery handled in Year 10. Multiple precise elements and validations show a strong grasp consistent with a comprehensive PASS under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR, reporting a specific value and interpreting it against WACC, which demonstrates conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, show how it was computed, or provide deeper exploration (e.g., methodology, checks, or multiple applications), so the treatment is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly determined and reported both simple and discounted payback periods and noted their interpretation, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, depth is limited: no cumulative cash flow walkthrough, identification of the break-even year mechanics, or sensitivity/implications beyond a brief comment. This meets basic correctness but lacks the thorough treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and interpreted the profitability index, showing conceptual understanding that PI > 1 indicates value creation. However, they did not explain or demonstrate the actual calculation as PV of benefits divided by the initial investment or detail what cash flows were included, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.",
