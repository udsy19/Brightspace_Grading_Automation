  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains NPV as discounting cash flows at WACC to time 0, provides a computed NPV, and applies it to decision-making, including sensitivity to WACC and revenue. Their validation of the formula and scenario analysis indicate a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS under moderate standards. Minor unit/notation issues do not undermine the core competency.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately explains and applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV is positive and reject when negative, demonstrated in both the base case decision and revenue-down sensitivity. They also validate the NPV computation approach, showing sound conceptual understanding across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages. This treatment is thorough enough for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and reviewed code outputs, described the block‑level financial calculations (EBIT, taxes, NOPAT, depreciation, cash flows) and confirmed the NPV formula was implemented correctly, reporting numeric NPV and IRR and sensitivity analysis. These demonstrate personal execution, understanding of the implementation, and validation of results, satisfying the strict technical implementation requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies IRR as a decision metric and provides IRR values in base and sensitivity cases, comparing them to the hurdle rate. However, they do not define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero nor demonstrate or explain the computation beyond invoking a built-in function. This reflects a correct but basic conceptual treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines simple and discounted payback and provides a specific simple payback result, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the treatment is brief, lacks methodological detail or year-by-year support, and offers minimal interpretation of implications, falling short of a thorough, in-depth analysis required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the standard PI formula equivalent to PV of benefits divided by initial investment and provides a PI result, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the PV-of-benefits calculation, provide detail, or interpret PI beyond a brief remark. Given the moderate standard, this is adequate but not thorough, so PARTIAL.",
