  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC changes), interpreted their numeric effects on NPV/IRR, and explicitly identified a breakpoint where a 20% revenue drop would flip the decision (NPV negative, IRR < hurdle). Coverage is applied and causally interpreted across DRIVER stages, meeting the criterion for a thorough sensitivity/scenario analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the code and shows that the implementation uses the stated formulas, and verbally links outputs (NPV, IRR) to assumptions and sensitivity analyses. The combination of Represent/Implement/Validate comments demonstrates clear verbal validation of code execution and matching logic, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly opens with a Define/Discover stage, states the project goal and captures key inputs (investment, working capital, revenues, costs, tax), and then outlines that analyses will proceed through DRIVER stages before moving to implementation. This meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be documented and completed prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis and does not discuss capital structure choices (buyback/dividend/debt reduction), quantify tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Given the absence of required trade-off analysis and Apple context, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR and operating leverage, briefly noting shareholder wealth, but provides no analysis of differing stakeholder incentives, who gains/loses, or agency conflicts. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics linked to leverage and buybacks. Given these gaps, it does not meet the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission discusses operating leverage but does not address financial leverage, DFL math, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics (e.g., interest coverage, DSCR) when considering debt levels. Given these gaps, the criterion is not demonstrated.",
