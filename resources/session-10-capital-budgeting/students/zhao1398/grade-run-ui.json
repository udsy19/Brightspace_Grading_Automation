  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case and multiple sensitivities (cost of capital sweep and a -20% revenue stress test), identified clear breakpoints where project preference flips (WACC ≈13%, revenue -20% → NPV negative), and connected these to strategic recommendations. Coverage includes implementation and validation of results, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: Student thoroughly narrates multiple visualizations, clearly stating what each chart shows, interpreting results for decision-makers (e.g., break-even timing for management), and explaining units and scenarios (years on payback, 4–14% WACC range, −20% revenue scenario). This depth across several visuals meets the criterion under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student conducted multiple sensitivities (discount rate and 20% revenue drop) and clearly explained implications, including thresholds (NPV turns negative near 13% WACC) and how downside alters the recommendation and risk profile (volume-driven). This meets moderate strictness and demonstrates thorough, applied understanding of stress testing.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires quantifying tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives and linking the trade-off to Apple’s current risk profile. The work focuses on a Starbucks project NPV with depreciation and salvage taxes, not capital structure trade-offs or Apple. No quantitative or conceptual analysis of buybacks/dividends/debt reduction is provided, so this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting linked to leverage/buybacks. Content remains at project-level valuation and strategy, with no stakeholder incentive discussion. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on operating leverage and WACC sensitivity, but does not analyze financial leverage (DFL), its effect on EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage ratios. Given the absence of leverage math or discussion of debt vs equity ramifications, it fails this criterion.",
