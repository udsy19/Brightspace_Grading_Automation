  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, accurate grasp of NPV by defining the discount rate, constructing all relevant cash flows, and applying discounting via an NPV profile and discounted payback. Multiple applications (NPV profile, scenario NPV, terminal tax effects) show thorough treatment beyond surface-level, satisfying the criterion at a PASS level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies the NPV decision rule thoroughly: accepts when NPV is positive at the 8.5% WACC and recognizes rejection when NPV turns negative under a 20% revenue drop. The NPV profile demonstrates understanding of the threshold where the project becomes unacceptable (~13% discount rate). This coverage across scenarios and decision making satisfies a strong conceptual grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly incorporates operating cash flow (NOPAT + depreciation), subtracts initial capex and working capital investment, and includes working capital recovery and after-tax salvage at exit—capturing FCF as OCF less capex and working capital changes. While there’s a minor wording slip on the tax shield percentage, the structure and specifics demonstrate a strong, thorough grasp consistent with a PASS under moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual understanding of IRR by using an NPV profile and identifying the approximate zero-NPV rate (~13%). However, they do not explicitly compute or present the IRR value nor clearly state the formal definition (the discount rate that makes NPV = 0), and the treatment lacks depth and detailed calculation. Thus, the coverage supports a Partial rather than a thorough Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the discounted payback concept and identifies the breakeven crossing around a little after year 8, showing basic understanding. However, the validation claims a simple payback of 4–5 years and incorrectly says it aligns with the chart, creating a contradiction and accuracy gap. Limited numerical detail further prevents a thorough treatment, so this merits PARTIAL, not PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not calculate or conceptually discuss the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While they compute and analyze NPV, IRR, and payback, there is no PI metric or explanation, which is required for this criterion. Therefore, despite solid DCF work, this criterion is not met.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: identified key assumptions (capex, working capital, tax rate, depreciation life) and the tax implication of the terminal sale.  \n- Implement: loaded those assumptions into the model (\"set up the code\" and inputs) and produced outputs (payback, NPV profiles).  \n- Validate: explicitly checked terminal-value tax treatment and payback realism as part of model validation.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly listed specific real-estate-related inputs (capex, working capital, salvage, straight-line depreciation, tax rate) and validated tax treatment of the terminal sale, showing correct application (Discover + Validate). However, they did not justify how key assumptions (the $12M capex, $3M sale price, choice of 10-year life) were derived or supported by comparable data—so documentation is present but lacks the explanatory justification required for a full PASS."

      "reasoning": "The student systematically walked through multiple DRIVER stages with specific examples (tax/timing rules, depreciation shield, NPV sensitivity, payback visualization) and produced a clear, supported recommendation. Although delivery included filler words, the explanation is detailed and covers definition, implementation, validation, and strategic reflection, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS."
