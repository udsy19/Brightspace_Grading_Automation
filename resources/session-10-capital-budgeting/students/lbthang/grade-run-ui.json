  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed code in Colab and reports concrete validation metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) that align with the earlier-described assumptions and cash-flow logic. They also ran sensitivity tests, demonstrating verification of results, which satisfies the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Define & Discover actions (isolating critical variables and project objective) before describing the represent and implement steps, showing the D-stage was completed up front. There is clear, sequential DRIVER stage narration and no indication the Discover work was done post-hoc.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented the planned model structure, required inputs, and metrics before coding and then implemented that plan by parameterizing variables and building the time-series schedule in Colab. They also linked the plan to outputs (NPV/IRR) and ran planned sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating systematic representation-to-implementation alignment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of tax shield benefits, financial distress costs, or flexibility/optionality costs across capital return choices, nor any connection to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. The work focuses on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis, which does not meet this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of who gains/loses across stakeholders or why incentives diverge, and it omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Mentioning management cost control does not constitute an agency-conflict analysis. Therefore, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission addresses operating leverage and NPV sensitivity but does not analyze financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice impacts EPS/ROE volatility and downside/bankruptcy risk. No leverage math (DFL/EPS/ROE) or coverage metrics are presented, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
