  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly identified and modeled only project-caused cash flows: initial capex, working capital deployment and recovery, operating cash flows after tax with depreciation add-back, and terminal value with tax. They avoided non-incremental items (e.g., financing), demonstrating a strong conceptual grasp across DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes straight-line depreciation, applies it in the EBIT → NOPAT → add-back sequence, and notes terminal-value tax treatment. They also ran the model in Colab and reported validated outputs, demonstrating personal execution and block-level understanding of how depreciation and taxes feed into cash flows and valuation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting in Python/Colab with parameterized inputs, a structured FCF model, and code-based NPV/IRR outputs, then extended it to automated sensitivity tests. This demonstrates thorough integration of technology into capital budgeting calculations across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages, meeting a comprehensive standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly set the discount rate and described/modelled to the point of reporting an NPV figure, showing conceptual understanding of NPV. However, inconsistent NPV results (12.6M vs 2.6M) and repeated “MPV/MVP” mislabeling, with no clear present value walkthrough, indicate incomplete and unclear treatment. Hence, correct but basic coverage merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the NPV decision rule (accept when NPV > 0) and links a negative NPV stress case to value destruction. However, the treatment is basic and includes inaccuracies/confusion (e.g., payback “above the cost of capital,” inconsistent NPV figures), falling short of a thorough, comprehensive explanation. Hence, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (12.84%) and compared it to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding and implementation. However, they did not explain IRR conceptually as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or detail the computation method, so the treatment lacks depth required for a PASS under this criterion.",

        "\"in the validate phase I am calculating the core metrics ... We see a positive MPV of 12.6 million and an irr of 12.84% ... I ran a sensitivity test ... with a 20% Drop in revenue the MPV turns negative approximately negative 645K\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (identified critical variables, WACC, tax, depreciation); Represent (mapped cash‑flow logic: EBIT → NOPAT → addback depreciation → FCF); Implement (built model in Google Colab); Validate (computed NPV, IRR, payback); Evolve (ran 20% revenue stress test); Reflect (gave recommendation and risk mitigation).",
      "reasoning": "The student explicitly anchored the work to the DRIVER framework and walked through multiple stages with concrete inputs, model logic, quantitative validation, sensitivity testing, and a recommendation. Coverage is detailed and specific rather than merely cursory, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS."
