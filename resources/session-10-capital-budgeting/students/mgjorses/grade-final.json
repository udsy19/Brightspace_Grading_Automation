  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined NPV as the sum of discounted future cash flows minus the initial investment and applied it with concrete figures, including terminal value and working capital, demonstrating method and results. They further validated the NPV via IRR and WACC sensitivity checks, indicating a thorough and accurate grasp suitable for a PASS despite minor numerical inconsistencies.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to the base case, plus interprets a negative NPV scenario as value-destroying, indicating rejection. Their implementation and reflection stages show comprehensive use of NPV across base and sensitivity cases, demonstrating a thorough understanding suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid conceptual grasp of IRR, including its definition as the rate that sets NPV to zero and practical use versus WACC, and they verify the zero-NPV property. They apply IRR across base and scenarios, showing depth beyond a surface mention. Minor numerical inconsistencies do not undermine the thorough, accurate treatment under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines operating free cash flow as EBIT*(1–T) + Depreciation, omitting capital expenditures and changes in working capital. Although they mention a $500k working capital requirement and the initial $12M investment, they do not integrate ΔNWC or capex into the FCF calculation as required. This reflects a fundamental error for this criterion, so it fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly modeled unlevered after-tax operating cash flows, included initial outlay and working capital, and avoided financing costs—showing a basic grasp of incremental cash flows. However, they did not explicitly address excluding non-incremental items (e.g., sunk costs, allocated overhead), opportunity costs/cannibalization, or working capital recovery details, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the OCF formula (EBIT × (1–T) + Depreciation) and recognized the depreciation tax shield, showing conceptual understanding. However, coverage is basic, lacks detailed examples or per-year OCF demonstrations, and includes a confusing statement linking the tax shield to marketing changes, indicating gaps. Hence, this meets a correct but not thorough standard.",
