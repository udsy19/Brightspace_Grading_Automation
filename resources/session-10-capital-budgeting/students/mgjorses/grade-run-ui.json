  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included a base case plus multiple sensitivities (±20% revenue, WACC ±2%) and explicitly calculated the break-even revenue modifier (-5.22%) where NPV=0. They also interpreted results (e.g., −20% revenue makes NPV negative and IRR below WACC), demonstrating both analysis and implications — meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms running the Python code and that outputs match the Excel model, and they describe concrete validation tests (IRR check and break-even NPV check) that verify results. These statements across Implement and Validate stages demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student verbally interprets multiple tables/visual outputs (Excel/Python model, scenario and WACC sensitivity tables), clearly stating scenarios, units (millions, percent), and the resulting NPVs/IRRs. They provide multiple examples and interpret the trade-off implications across scenarios, meeting the criterion at a thorough level under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off (interest tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Content is limited to Starbucks project cash flows and capital budgeting metrics, with only a depreciation tax effect noted, which is not the required capital structure analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts across stakeholders, no identification of which parties gain or lose under different financing/policy choices, and no explanation of asset substitution or risk shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite a full capital budgeting workflow, the criterion is missing entirely, warranting a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on unlevered project evaluation (NPV/IRR/payback) and explicitly excludes interest effects, providing no discussion or math on DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or how financing choice changes downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics (e.g., interest coverage, DSCR) under different debt choices. Despite solid DRIVER execution on capital budgeting, the leverage-specific criterion is not addressed, so this fails.",
