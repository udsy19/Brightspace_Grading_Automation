  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (±2% WACC and −20% revenue), reported numeric NPVs/IRRs, and explicitly identified the 20% revenue decline as the breakpoint that flips the accept/reject decision. This demonstrates a thorough, actionable sensitivity analysis consistent with the DRIVER stages, so it meets PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes running and walking through the Python code and provides concrete numeric validation checks (initial outflow, depreciation effects, terminal cash flow composition) that match stated assumptions and formulas. These detailed validation statements across Implement and Validate demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of correct code execution.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes what the charts/tables show and explains the units and scenarios (millions of dollars, WACC/IRR percentages, revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), including specific values and implications. These verbal descriptions tied to the Implement and Evolve stages are sufficiently thorough for a moderate standard, covering multiple visuals and scenario outcomes.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off (interest tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, nor does it connect conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Content centers on a Starbucks project evaluation with depreciation tax shield and sensitivity to WACC, which is unrelated to the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never identifies differing stakeholder incentives, who gains/loses under alternatives, or discusses agency problems. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics linked to leverage or buybacks. Under the moderate standard, at least a conceptual discussion was required; none is provided.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission provides project evaluation (NPV, IRR, payback, PI, sensitivity) but contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs. equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Given the absence of leverage analysis across DRIVER stages, this criterion is not demonstrated.",
