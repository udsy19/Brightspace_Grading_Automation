  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines NPV, applies the correct discount rate, and demonstrates a full application using incremental cash flows, initial outlay, and terminal value, with results and sensitivity analysis. The coverage is comprehensive across DRIVER stages, showing strong conceptual grasp and application sufficient for a PASS in a moderate strictness category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule and applies it to the base case and sensitivity cases to make accept/reject calls. They also justify relying on NPV when payback metrics conflict, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding. Minor sign inconsistency in one sentence doesn’t undermine the comprehensive, correct application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and applies it by computing and interpreting IRR for the base and multiple scenarios, comparing it to WACC to make decisions. Multiple applications (base, revenue drop, WACC shifts) and consistency checks demonstrate a strong, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: While the student defines payback conceptually, the reported payback periods (11.67 and 22.26 years) are inconsistent with their own cash flows and a positive NPV. Given a -$12.5M initial outlay and sizeable annual OCFs plus a $5.3M terminal-year FCF, simple payback should occur well before year 10, not after, indicating an inaccurate determination.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the profitability index and reported a computed PI > 1, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not show the calculation details (e.g., explicit PV of benefits vs. initial outlay) or reconcile PI with NPV, leaving depth and thoroughness lacking for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding by correctly using OCF = NI + Depreciation and applying it to the EBIT=0 case, yielding OCF equal to depreciation. However, they also present an incorrect formula (EBIT×(1−T) + DTS instead of + Depreciation), indicating a conceptual gap.

      "reasoning": "The student consistently uses the firm's WACC and reports project IRR/NPV, but never cites or compares to industry benchmark returns for retail locations. Because the criterion asks for industry benchmark returns and the submission contains no such external benchmark discussion or comparison, it fails to meet the requirement."
