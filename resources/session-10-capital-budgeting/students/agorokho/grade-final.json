  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly applied NPV by defining the discount rate, structuring all cash flows including initial outlay, working capital, and terminal value, and coding and reporting the NPV result. Sensitivity and visualization further demonstrate depth of understanding. The DRIVER stages collectively show a comprehensive, accurate treatment of NPV.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly ties acceptance to positive NPV relative to the hurdle rate and notes that negative NPV under adverse revenue would reverse the decision, demonstrating the NPV decision rule. They compute NPV, interpret it, and apply sensitivity to discuss accept/reject conditions, showing thorough, conceptually sound treatment across DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they implemented and ran NPV and IRR functions, provides the numeric outputs, and demonstrates validation of the underlying cash flows that feed those metrics. This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level modeling, and ownership, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR from the project cash flows and used it correctly in decision-making and sensitivity, showing it is independent of WACC changes. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate that property, providing only brief results without depth. This reflects correct but basic treatment, meriting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and computed both simple and discounted payback and provided clear base-case values, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, they did not detail the year-by-year cumulative cash flows, discuss inclusion effects (e.g., working capital timing) on payback, or analyze scenario sensitivity for payback, making the treatment accurate but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines the profitability index as PV of inflows relative to initial outlay, applies it with the proper discount rate, reports a PI value (1.24), and interprets it. However, they do not show the detailed calculation (e.g., PV sum or initial outlay components) or explore PI across scenarios, so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Hence, Partial.",
