  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included the required base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue down 20%, WACC ±2ppt) and reported numeric NPVs/IRRs. Crucially they identified a concrete breakpoint—20% revenue decline flips NPV negative—and visualized NPV behavior, demonstrating a clear understanding of where stakeholder preference would change. These elements meet the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the code, reports specific numeric outputs, and verbally verifies key assumptions and intermediatechecks against expected values. These statements across Implement and Validate stages show thorough confirmation that the code ran and the results align with the stated logic and assumptions.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly cites the source of all figures (assignment PDF) and describes centralizing assumptions before modeling. They also show that assumptions are echoed and validated in outputs (e.g., revenue, COGS %, working capital timing), satisfying data provenance and assumption logging to a thorough, conceptually clear standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student does not discuss or quantify tax shield advantages or expected distress/optionality costs across capital return/deleveraging alternatives, and provides no linkage to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. The work is entirely a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis, so this criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of stakeholder incentive conflicts, who gains/loses, or why incentives diverge, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. References to “shareholder value” and managerial monitoring are too general and do not meet the criterion’s required depth. Therefore, the student fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of financial leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Sensitivity to WACC and revenue is covered, but financing choice effects are missing. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided, so this criterion is not met.",
