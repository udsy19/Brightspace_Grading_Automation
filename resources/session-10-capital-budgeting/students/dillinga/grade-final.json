  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines NPV, lays out the necessary cash flow components (including taxes, depreciation add-back, working capital recovery, and terminal value), and applies NPV across base and sensitivity scenarios with correct WACC relationships. Multiple quantified NPVs and interpretation show depth beyond surface-level discussion, satisfying a thorough, conceptually solid treatment under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0) and applies it across multiple scenarios (base case accept; −20% revenue reject; higher WACC still accept if NPV positive). The treatment is thorough and accurate, integrated across DRIVER stages, demonstrating strong conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines IRR, computes it in the model, and applies it to both base and stress scenarios, comparing to WACC. They also note the single-IRR condition, showing depth beyond a basic mention. This meets a thorough, conceptually strong treatment under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies OCF conceptually as based on EBIT, applies the 25% tax rate, and adds back straight-line depreciation, aligning with EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation. However, they do not explicitly show the formula nor provide a worked numerical example to demonstrate thorough application. This reflects correct but basic coverage, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly treats working capital as an initial outflow recovered at project end and includes a terminal value inflow at Year 10, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, they do not address the after-tax treatment of salvage/terminal value (e.g., tax on gain/recapture vs book value) or disposal costs, leaving important nuances unexplored. This is adequate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission shows clear understanding of NPV/IRR concepts, a worked implementation flow, and interpreted results (Represent, Implement, Validate). However, under the strict Technical Implementation standard the student did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution details (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\", block‑by‑block explanation of functions) or present code outputs/verification steps, so full PASS cannot be awarded.",

        "\"we are going to work step by step through the driver framework which is going to help us lead to our solution.\"",
        "\"NPV is the net present value, the present value of project cash flows minus the initial investment.\"",
        "\"The driver proc uh process really forced me to think strategically starting with clarity, modeling rigorously, validating carefully and evolving the analysis beyond a single project.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "The student explicitly followed multiple DRIVER stages: Define/Discover (problem framing and objectives), Implement/Represent (variable setup, cash‑flow calculations, plots, scenario tests), Validate/Evolve/Reflect (sensitivity analysis, scenario results, strategic recommendation, and suggested next steps), demonstrating coherent application of the framework.",
      "reasoning": "The submission systematically applied the DRIVER framework, explained key capital‑budgeting concepts (NPV, IRR, payback), and ran multiple scenarios/sensitivity checks with a clear recommendation and reflection. Coverage is detailed and comprehensive, meeting the PASS standard."
