  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents a base case plus multiple sensitivities (–20% revenue and WACC at 6.5%/10.5%), reports numeric outcomes, and explicitly identifies the breakpoint where NPV/IRR flip decision (accept → reject). Planning, execution, and validation stages in the DRIVER workflow are evident, showing a thorough sensitivity/scenario analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly reports executing the model (plots, free cash flow outputs) and cites specific numeric results (NPV positive $3M, NPV -$2M under -20% revenue). They also explicitly state that outputs comport with expectations (WACC–NPV relationship, stable IRR), demonstrating both run confirmation and alignment of assumptions/logic with results.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated what the visualizations show (cash flows over 10 years, base vs -20% revenue, and WACC scenarios) and interpreted the results with specific units and values (millions, percentages, years). They also linked the insights to capital allocation decisions, discussing scenario trade-offs and portfolio ranking. This is thorough and meets the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze or quantify tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs, nor compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile; in fact, it analyzes a Starbucks project and explicitly ignores financing structure.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify gains/losses across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it discuss incentive divergence. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. Only a generic shareholder-value focus is present, which is insufficient for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission omits leverage analysis entirely, explicitly excluding financing structure and providing no DFL/EPS/ROE volatility discussion or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. WACC sensitivity is not a substitute for showing how financing choice affects ROE/EPS risk. Therefore, it fails this criterion.",
