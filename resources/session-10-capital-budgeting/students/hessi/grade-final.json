  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported IRR, applied it against the hurdle rate, and analyzed how IRR responds to changes in project drivers (revenue) while correctly noting it does not change with WACC. Multiple applications (base case and sensitivities) and interpretation demonstrate a strong, accurate grasp of IRR consistent with the criterion. Minor typos do not materially affect the thoroughness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly integrates technology by using Python to automate a full capital budgeting model (cash flows, NPV/IRR/PI) and produce sensitivity visualizations. They further demonstrate forward-looking automation improvements (Monte Carlo), showing depth beyond basic discussion. This satisfies a thorough treatment under a moderate standard, aligning with Discover, Implement, and Evolve stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly models multi-phase cash flows: initial outlay, distinct revenue phases (Y1, Y2–5, Y6–10), year-specific marketing, working capital deployment/recovery, and terminal value, and outlines a full year 0–10 schedule. They also implement the model (code) and discuss enhancements. This meets a thorough, conceptually detailed treatment for a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student demonstrates core NPV mechanics: discounting free cash flows at WACC, producing an NPV figure, and running sensitivities. However, they misstate the NPV decision rule (using “>1”/“<1” thresholds and calling a negative NPV “positive”), indicating conceptual gaps. Given the mix of correct application with notable misunderstandings, this meets a basic but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student applies the NPV decision rule to reject a project with negative NPV, showing basic understanding. However, they repeatedly misstate the acceptance threshold as “greater than one” and “less than one” (confusing NPV with profitability index), indicating a notable conceptual error. Thus, understanding is present but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses payback metrics and concludes the discounted payback is never achieved, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not provide the actual simple payback period in years or detailed steps/figures supporting the conclusion, making the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, this merits a PARTIAL score under the moderate standard.",
