  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript clearly states the problem scope, objectives, and intended stakeholders up front (Discover) and then proceeds to the Python cash‑flow representation and implementation. Because the D-stage is explicit and precedes modeling, the criterion is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly described the planned models, metrics, and scenarios (cash flow model, NPV/IRR/PI, sensitivity tests) and then showed those plans were implemented via Python code, a produced cash flow schedule, and scenario outputs. This shows a systematic mapping from representation to implementation, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a systematic workflow: code-backed cash flow construction, explicit metric calculations, and sensitivity scenarios with reported numeric results — meeting the moderate-standard expectation for methodological execution. Minor explanatory slips do not undermine the clear, traceable implementation of the planned analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, nor quantify tax shield benefits versus expected distress or flexibility costs, and it never connects to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content focuses on Starbucks project cash flows and NPV/IRR; even under a moderate standard, the required conceptual trade-off analysis is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on capital budgeting metrics and sensitivity but does not analyze stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing/buyback choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics. Mentions of “debt and equity” and “shareholders” are generic and do not meet the criterion’s depth requirements.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not present DFL/leverage math, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Discussion focuses on project NPV/IRR and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, not leverage-related downside risk, so it fails this criterion.",
