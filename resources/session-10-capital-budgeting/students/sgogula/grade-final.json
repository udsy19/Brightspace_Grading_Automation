  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately described how to compute NPV (discount future cash flows at WACC and incorporate the initial investment) and produced specific NPV results for base and multiple sensitivity scenarios. This shows a thorough and applied understanding of NPV within a full capital budgeting workflow across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule, explicitly accepting the project because NPV is positive and reinforcing this across multiple sensitivity scenarios. They provide specific NPV figures and link the accept decision to NPV positivity, demonstrating a solid conceptual grasp consistent with the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, describes how the NPV function is applied (demonstrating block-level understanding), and reports concrete computed NPVs and IRRs including sensitivity scenarios. These items meet the strict requirement for personal execution, functional understanding, and ownership, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and reported IRR and used it in decision-making, showing basic understanding. However, reporting IRR changing when only WACC changes indicates a conceptual error (IRR depends on cash flows, not the discount rate), and there was no deeper explanation that IRR is the rate making NPV = 0. Thus, evidence supports a correct but incomplete treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported both simple and discounted payback periods and incorporated them into the decision, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is basic with little explanation of the methodology (e.g., cumulative cash flow crossover, partial-year interpolation) or interpretation depth. This supports a PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported a profitability index value, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not explain or demonstrate the formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or the calculation steps, limiting depth. Under moderate strictness, this is correct but not thorough, so PARTIAL.",
