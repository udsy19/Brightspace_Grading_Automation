  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the code, verified functions compiled and ran, and reports specific numeric outputs. They also describe key assumptions (investment, depreciation, WACC, revenues) and present sensitivity scenarios with corresponding changes in NPV/IRR, showing the logic matches the results—satisfying the verbal confirmation criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: Student integrated sensitivity testing into the model and ran multiple scenarios on key drivers (revenue, WACC) with specific numerical impacts on NPV and IRR, then interpreted how these change risk/decision (revenue-sensitive, WACC-robust, still accept). This satisfies moderate-category expectations for built-in stress testing and explanation of risk profile shifts, showing clear Implement and Evolve evidence.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly shows the Discover/Define work performed first (stating scope and defining parameters) and then the modeling/implementation steps that used those definitions. There is no indication the D-stage was done post-hoc, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project-level capital budgeting (NPV/IRR/sensitivity) and does not quantify tax shield benefits or expected financial distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. There is no discussion linking any trade-off conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder incentive conflicts (who gains/loses) and no mention of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. While the student thoroughly covers capital budgeting metrics and sensitivity analysis (Implement/Reflect), the specific agency-conflict criterion is missing, leading to a FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor any mention of bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. Work centers on project cash flows and sensitivity to revenue and WACC, which does not meet this criterion’s requirements even under a moderate standard.",
