  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applies NPV with appropriate discounting assumptions and initial outlay and provides a concrete base-case NPV plus sensitivity analyses, showing depth beyond a basic mention. Multiple DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate, Evolve) substantiate a thorough and conceptually sound NPV treatment appropriate for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV is positive and recognize value destruction (implying rejection) when NPV turns negative under stress. They demonstrate this across base, sensitivity, and recommendation stages, indicating a strong conceptual grasp suitable for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described block-level cash-flow logic, implemented a metrics function for NPV/IRR, and stated they ran the code with specific numeric results. They show personal execution, ownership, and sufficient technical detail to verify correct calculation steps, meeting the strict requirements.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly computed and applied IRR in decision-making, showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, show how it was solved, or explore it beyond a single reported value. The treatment is correct but not thorough, fitting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student acknowledges computing payback period but provides no payback value, methodology, or interpretation. Coverage is basic and overshadowed by NPV/IRR/PI, showing understanding exists but lacks depth. Therefore, this criterion is partially demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Although the student reports a PI and ties it to decision-making, their interpretation is incorrect (PI=1.28 means $1.28 of PV benefits per $1 invested, not $128). They also never state the correct definition (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). Given the inaccurate explanation and lack of clear conceptual definition, this criterion fails.",
