  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and reports specific numeric results (NPV ~3.5M, IRR ~13.6%, PI 1.28) and ties those outcomes to the modeling assumptions (timeline, taxes, depreciation, working capital). They also performed sensitivity checks, which supports that outputs were validated against expectations, meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents the problem statement and assumptions and states these were defined \"before writing any calculation logic,\" satisfying the requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling. Evidence shows a clear, ordered DRIVER flow (Define → Represent → Implement).\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented inputs and modeling choices before coding, described how accounting rules were translated into logical structures (timeline, cost components, taxes), and implemented a metrics function and scenario tests that directly reflect that plan. This shows a systematic linkage from represent-stage planning to implemented artifacts and scenario analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a Starbucks project capital budgeting model and never analyzes leverage choices, tax shields, financial distress, or capital return alternatives, nor does it reference Apple’s balance sheet. Given the complete absence of the required trade-off quantification and Apple-specific linkage, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of shareholder vs. bondholder vs. management/employee incentive conflicts, who gains/loses under alternatives, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. It focuses on NPV/IRR and sensitivity only. Under the moderate standard, the required conceptual coverage is missing, so this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never discusses leverage math (DFL), nor how debt financing affects EPS/ROE volatility or downside/bankruptcy risk; no coverage metrics are presented. While the student performs sensitivity on revenues and WACC, this is not a treatment of financing-leverage effects. Under moderate standards, conceptual discussion would suffice, but leverage and risk implications are missing entirely.",
