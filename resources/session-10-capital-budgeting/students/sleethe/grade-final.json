  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately constructs FCFs including initial outlay, working capital, terminal value, and recovery, then discounts at the stated WACC to compute and report NPV, with validation via IRR and sensitivity analyses. This demonstrates thorough, correct application of NPV beyond a surface mention, meeting the moderate standard for depth. Minor wording slips do not undermine the clear, accurate NPV treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames the decision in NPV terms, calculates a positive base-case NPV, and ties the accept decision to that result. They also discuss scenarios where NPV would fall (value-destroying), demonstrating correct application of the NPV accept/reject rule. Minor wording/typo issues do not undermine the clear, thorough understanding shown across stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR but explicitly validated it by showing that substituting IRR into the NPV equation yields near zero, demonstrating correct conceptual understanding. They further applied IRR in sensitivity analysis and decision context, providing thorough, multi-faceted treatment appropriate for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly computed and reported both simple and discounted payback periods, showing basic understanding of recovery timing. However, there’s no explanation of calculation mechanics, cumulative cash flow crossover, thresholds, or interpretation relative to project life, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported a plausible PI (≈1.22), evidencing basic understanding and application in the Implement stage. However, they did not explain the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) and gave a contradictory statement in the Reflect stage, preventing a thorough, accurate treatment needed for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding and application of OCF (using EBIT and depreciation with taxes) and provides year-by-year OCF outputs and a validation check. However, they do not explicitly present or walk through the OCF formula EBIT × (1−T) + Depreciation with a detailed example, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.",
