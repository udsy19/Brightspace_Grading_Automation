  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running the code and shows concrete validation steps (matching hand calculations, total depreciation, IRR back-solve) that tie assumptions to results. Multiple validation examples and the described implementation plan demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documents the define/discover information (investment size, horizon, WACC, decision question) at the start and states the modeling architecture was planned \"before coding,\" demonstrating D-stage completion prior to modeling. This satisfies the strict requirement for explicit stage demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly documented a pre-implementation plan describing models, metrics, scenarios, and required data, and then implemented that plan producing the corresponding tables, metrics, and sensitivity visualizations. This direct linkage between the Represent and Implement stages meets the criterion for systematic representation prior to coding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss the capital structure trade-off (tax shield vs. distress/flexibility costs) or compare buyback/dividend/debt reduction options, nor does it quantify tax advantages or expected costs. It also fails to connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The work centers on Starbucks project-level capital budgeting and taxes, not debt tax shields or capital allocation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. While DRIVER stages are demonstrated, they do not address this criterion, so the student fails it.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice impacts ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. There is no leverage math, no EPS/ROE discussion, and no bankruptcy/coverage metrics; the analysis stays at project-level cash flows and WACC sensitivity. Given the moderate standard, even a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is absent.",
