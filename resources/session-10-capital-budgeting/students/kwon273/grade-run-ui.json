  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the model, produced outputs and visualizations, and performed logical validation checks tied to listed assumptions (depreciation, working-capital timing, terminal value, sensitivity direction). These concrete verbal confirmations and matching logic satisfy the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly presents Define and a comprehensive Discover stage with assumptions \"before modeling anything\" and then describes mapping the model prior to coding, satisfying the strict requirement that Define & Discover are completed and documented prior to implementation. Therefore the criterion is met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified the modeling approach, required data, evaluation metrics, and sensitivity scenarios before implementation (Represent) and then implemented those elements systematically in code and outputs (Implement). This direct mapping from plan to implemented artifacts satisfies the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student does not discuss buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, quantify tax shield benefits or expected financial distress/optionality costs, or link any trade-off to Apple’s current risk profile. The work is focused on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR model, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different financing/payout choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks. Content focuses exclusively on project cash flows and valuation metrics, with only a brief shareholder-value remark and no treatment of other stakeholders or agency dynamics.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs equity affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It remains a pure unlevered capital budgeting analysis (NPV/IRR/WACC), with no capital structure modeling or stakeholder risk implications.",
