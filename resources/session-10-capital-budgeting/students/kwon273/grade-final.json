  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined NPV and thoroughly applied it by constructing correct cash flows (including initial outflow, terminal value, and WC timing), coding an NPV function, and validating discounting at the 8.5% hurdle rate with sensitivity checks. This demonstrates a strong, comprehensive grasp consistent with a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately articulates the NPV decision rule and links it to the firm’s WACC, then implements and validates the NPV calculation. They explicitly use the rule to accept the project because NPV is positive, reinforcing understanding with sensitivity context. This is thorough and satisfies a knowledgeable reviewer.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes the cash-flow mechanics, implemented custom NPV and IRR functions (with a Newton-Raphson solver), and states they ran and validated the model outputs with sensible sensitivity checks. This demonstrates personal execution, block-level understanding, and ownership consistent with the strict standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented and used IRR, and interpreted it against the hurdle rate, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor provide deeper discussion or examples of the concept’s mechanics or nuances. Thus, the treatment is correct but not thorough, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included both simple and discounted payback and implemented functions to compute them, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not present the actual payback period, show cumulative cash flow recovery timing, or discuss differences/implications between simple and discounted payback. Given the moderate standard, this is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS, so it merits a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and applied the profitability index and framed the PV-versus-investment concept, but did not explicitly define PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment or show a detailed calculation/example. Given moderate strictness, this shows clear understanding but lacks the depth and explicitness needed for a PASS.",
