  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and reports concrete outputs (MPV and IR) and links those results to the stated assumptions and FCF logic. They also performed sensitivity checks, showing validation beyond a single run. This satisfies the verbal confirmation and matching of logic to results at a level warranting PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student ran explicit sensitivity/stress tests on key value drivers (WACC and revenue volume), quantified the impact on NPV, and linked results to the recommendation and risk profile. This demonstrates that sensitivity testing is built into the model and shows how changes alter the investment decision, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level under the moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents Define (objective) and Discover (variables and constraints) before any modeling activity and states the represent phase occurred before writing code. There is no indication the Discover stage was done post-hoc, so the criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss the capital structure trade-off among buybacks, dividends, or debt reduction, nor quantify tax advantages versus distress/flexibility costs. It focuses on a Starbucks project appraisal and only references a depreciation tax shield, with no connection to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion of stakeholder incentive divergence, who gains/loses under different financing/payout choices, or asset substitution/risk-shifting is present. The submission focuses on cash-flow modeling and sensitivity to WACC/revenue, which does not meet this criterion even under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address leverage math (DFL, EPS/ROE effects) or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Even at a moderate standard, a conceptual discussion of how debt vs equity changes ROE/EPS volatility and risk is missing; analysis is limited to WACC-based NPV/IRR and revenue/WACC sensitivities.",
