  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough NPV application: constructing FCFs, explicitly including the initial investment and terminal value, using WACC as the discount benchmark, and reporting a concrete NPV figure. Sensitivity analysis on WACC and revenues further shows depth beyond a basic mention, satisfying a comprehensive, conceptually sound treatment under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule—accept when NPV > 0—and demonstrates it across base and sensitivity scenarios, noting acceptance with positive NPV and risk when NPV turns negative. Use of Verify and Evolve stages shows thorough application rather than a superficial mention, meeting the moderate standard for depth.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the FCF structure (after-tax operating earnings plus depreciation tax shield minus capex and working capital changes) and describes implementation details handling initial investment and working capital terminal adjustments. This shows a strong conceptual and applied grasp sufficient for a thorough treatment under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly computed and used an IRR (13.5%) in decision-making, showing conceptual understanding and application within the Implement/Verify stages. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate making NPV zero or detail the computation method, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student identifies a payback period (“breaks even in year six”), showing correct conceptual understanding. However, they don’t specify methodology (discounted vs. simple payback) or provide supporting cumulative cash-flow detail, so coverage is basic rather than thorough. Thus, it meets the criterion at a satisfactory but not strong level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses NPV and IRR but never computes or conceptually explains the Profitability Index. In a moderate category, a conceptual mention or calculation of PI (>1 threshold) would suffice, but it is absent; thus, the criterion is not met.",
