  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV as the present value of future cash flows (including terminal value) net of the initial outlay, uses WACC for discounting, and computes a specific NPV used in the decision. They apply NPV across implementation, validation, and reflection with sensitivity and break-even analysis, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, accurate grasp of the NPV decision rule, explicitly defining NPV≥0 as the accept condition, prioritizing NPV over IRR in conflicts, and applying the rule across base and adverse scenarios. The use of sensitivity analysis and break-even thresholds shows depth beyond a basic mention, meeting the thoroughness needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately computed IRR (12.84%), applied the correct decision rule (IRR ≥ WACC), and explicitly recognized that at discount rates above 12.84% NPV becomes negative—demonstrating the definition of IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero. They integrated IRR into implementation, validation, and reflection, showing thorough understanding and application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Despite correctly defining and attempting to compute both payback measures, the reported discounted payback of ~1.21 years is inconsistent with the project’s cash flows (e.g., Year 2 OCF $2.7M versus a $12M+ initial outlay), indicating a clear calculation/interpretation error. Given the financial accuracy focus of this criterion, this fundamental mistake warrants a FAIL even under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied the PI decision rule, demonstrating basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) and misinterpreted PI=1.22 as “$12 per $1,” indicating a notable conceptual error. Coverage is adequate but not thorough, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames and applies incremental cash flows, capturing initial outlay, operating cash flows with tax shields, working capital timing, and terminal value with taxes, and avoids financing flows. However, coverage is not thorough: they do not explicitly address excluding sunk/allocated overhead or incorporating opportunity costs/cannibalization in incremental terms.

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly states mission/objective and scope; Represent — lays out key equations and cash-flow mapping; Implement/Validate — explains coding approach, metrics, and sanity checks; Evolve/Reflect — discusses non-financial benefits, risks, sensitivity, and gives a documented recommendation. These stages collectively demonstrate organized DRIVER-based communication.",
      "reasoning": "The submission provides a thorough, well-structured explanation of goals, methods (including the core ICF equation and metrics), computational approach, sensitivity analysis, and a reasoned recommendation tied to non-financial factors. Multiple concrete examples, numeric parameters, and explicit DRIVER-stage discussion meet the criteria for clear and comprehensive communication."
