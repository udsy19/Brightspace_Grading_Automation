  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed base-case and multiple sensitivity tests (revenue shock and whack changes), quantified breakpoints (9.3% revenue decline and 4.34% whack margin), and tied those breakpoints to decision rules (rejection trigger and contingency). This is a thorough, well-executed scenario and sensitivity analysis meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described running the code, walking through its logic and assumptions, and performed a concrete validation by hand-checking year‑2 cash flows against Excel with matching results. This shows thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution across Represent, Implement, and Validate stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student repeatedly and clearly described what the charts/tables showed across scenarios, interpreting direction and decision implications (e.g., NPV positive/negative, IRR vs WACC). They also referenced units and scenario parameters (dollars, percentages, years, ±2% WACC, −20% revenue, 9.3% revenue buffer, 4.34% WACC margin). This thorough verbal narration across multiple visuals and scenarios meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires quantifying debt tax shield benefits versus financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction and tying conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet. The submission focuses on a Starbucks project NPV and only mentions depreciation tax shields, with no capital structure or payout analysis and no Apple linkage. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify divergent incentives or who gains/loses across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it address asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. The work focuses on project NPV/IRR, sensitivity, and operational risks, leaving the agency-conflict criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not present DFL/leverage math, and does not address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. The work is thorough on project NPV/IRR but entirely omits the leverage criterion, so it fails this standard.",
