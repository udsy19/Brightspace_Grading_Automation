  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a clear base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20% and WACC ±2%), reported quantitative impacts on NPV/IRR, and identified the break-even revenue range (85–90%). DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) show the model was constructed, coded, and stress-tested—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly described what the charts/tables showed and interpreted them, including scenarios and units (percentages, millions) and sensitivity outcomes. They explicitly tied outputs to stakeholder impact (shareholder value) and capital allocation trade-offs (revenue shocks vs WACC changes). This meets the criterion thoroughly under moderate strictness.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student implemented explicit sensitivity/stress tests on key drivers (revenue shock and WACC shifts), provided numerical outcomes (NPV/IRR changes), and interpreted how these affect risk and decision robustness (revenue as critical risk, project resilient to higher WACC). The discussion is specific and ties the sensitivities to the recommendation, showing thorough and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a project NPV/IRR analysis (for Starbucks), not on Apple’s capital structure choices among buybacks/dividends/debt reduction. It does not quantify tax shield benefits or distress/flexibility costs, nor connect any trade-off to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the required criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on NPV/IRR and strategy for shareholders, with no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Under moderate standards, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is absent; thus, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or calculations of financial leverage (DFL), EPS/ROE sensitivity to capital structure, or downside/bankruptcy risk via coverage metrics. It focuses on WACC sensitivity and operating/revenue shocks only. Under the moderate standard, even a conceptual treatment of leverage and coverage would suffice, but it is missing; thus, the criterion fails.",
