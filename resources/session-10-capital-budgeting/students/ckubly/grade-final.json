  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong grasp of NPV by building a cash flow timeline, applying an explicit discount rate (8.5% WACC), calculating NPV, and interpreting accept/reject criteria. They deepen this with multiple applications via sensitivity to revenue and discount rate, showing how NPV changes under scenarios. Despite minor inconsistencies in figures, the treatment is thorough and meets the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to a base case and adverse scenarios, linking positive NPV to value creation and negative NPV to value destruction. Sensitivity discussion demonstrates application depth across conditions, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment appropriate for a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student determined both simple and discounted payback, provided specific values (5.3–5.4 years and 8.2 years), identified the recovery years (early year 6 and year 9), and explained the conceptual difference (ignoring vs. accounting for time value) and liquidity-risk relevance. This reflects a thorough, applied understanding supported by a constructed cash flow schedule and implemented calculations, meeting PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR across scenarios and used it against a hurdle rate, showing practical understanding. However, they did not explain that IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or demonstrate that relationship, so coverage is applied and basic rather than thorough. Under the moderate standard, this merits a Partial rather than a Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: While the student reported a PI value and the correct acceptance rule (>1), they did not explain PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment and gave a materially incorrect interpretation (“$122 per $1” instead of $1.22). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the metric, which fails the Financial Concepts Accuracy criterion despite implementation efforts.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a correct conceptual approach by constructing operating and financial cash flow schedules and explicitly accounting for working capital outflow/recovery and terminal asset sale, implying FCF treatment. However, they do not explicitly articulate or thoroughly detail FCF as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and changes in working capital, leaving the calculation mechanics at a basic level.

      "reasoning": "The submission documents many key financial assumptions (tax, revenues, operating costs, depreciation, initial investment) and implements them in code and scenarios, demonstrating understanding. However, it lacks focused validation or justification of real estate/construction cost assumptions (no breakdown, sources, or rationale for the asset valuation or construction estimates), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence show both clear framing and reproducible work, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS."
