  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept when NPV > 0) and applies it to base and sensitivity cases, indicating acceptance in positive-NPV scenarios and concern/rejection when NPV turns negative. They provide multiple applications (base case, WACC up/down, revenue decline) and relate NPV to decision-making, demonstrating thorough conceptual understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, reported computed IRR values, and applied the IRR decision rule versus WACC, including sensitivity cases. This demonstrates a strong conceptual grasp and practical application consistent with a moderate evaluation standard, supported by Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines both simple and discounted payback, provides specific computed values, and correctly explains the crossover of cumulative cash flows as the determination method. The discussion is thorough and applied to their model outputs, meeting moderate strictness via clear conceptual understanding backed by implementation and reflection.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly interpreted NPV results, used WACC appropriately, and discussed sensitivity, showing conceptual understanding. However, they misstated the NPV definition and did not thoroughly explain the present value calculation, falling short of a comprehensive, accurate treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the profitability index and applied it to the project (PI = 1.22 > 1), demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic and relies on tool output without deeper explanation, derivation, or multiple applications, and the student characterizes the analysis as “surface-level.” Under the moderate standard, this supports a PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly references free cash flow and includes working capital changes in the schedule, and uses cumulative free cash flow in analysis. However, they do not articulate or demonstrate the specific FCF calculation as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and changes in working capital, nor do they detail CapEx treatment beyond mentioning initial investment.

      "reasoning": "The student provides detailed, accurate explanations of required metrics, cites numerical outcomes, and interprets sensitivity results and business implications—demonstrating depth beyond a brief mention. Combined evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows a strong, coherent understanding that meets the PASS standard."
