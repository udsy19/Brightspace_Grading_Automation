  "transcript": "Okay, so for the Starbucks assignment, we're basically given some data right here, the initial investment of this flagship roastery project, kind of the working capital we have, revenues, operating costs, taxes. So then our job is to, I think this part kind of highlights it most clearly, we need a cash flow schedule that includes revenue, operating costs, appreciation tax, shields, taxes, working capital changes, internal value, the net present value, the internal rate of return, the discounted payback period, simple payback period, and then profitability index. And then we have this sensitivity analysis that we need to run. And then just kind of an overall recommendation that's kind of weighing all of these metrics to make a decision on if this is worth it. So I went over to Gemini, and I pretty much put all of that in there, and then told it to run code for me, which was decently effective on the first run. I got part of the assignment done, but not the whole thing. So we'll scroll down. So I got this cash flow model that it was asking about. So again, you can kind of see revenue, taxes, depreciation, all the things I mentioned above over a 10-year horizon here. And we can kind of see these initial numbers here, the hurdle rate, net present value, IRR, payback period, year six. So that means it's going to take six years to kind of recoup that investment. And then you get a recommendation based on the net present value, 2.69 million here, roughly is greater than zero. IRR exceeds that weighted average cost, or that hurdle rate, which is 8.5%. And that internal rate of return is 12.84%. Again, that's basically just saying where net present value is zero, so pretty much at your break-even point. So if that is exceeding this hurdle rate, that is going to mean, in general, that it's a good investment. Again, net present value is kind of just dealing with the future cost of capital inflows minus the present value of those cash outflows. So again, we're looking at numbers that are positive here for that. So obviously, this is positive. That is a good thing. So this is some very surface-level data. We get the sensitivity analysis here, the different net present values at different weighted average capital costs. So we get some surface-level data. We get some of the answers to our questions. I wanted to kind of go through each question individually and go a little bit more in-depth. I think question one with that one was answered very in-depth. I think this was, we got, I mean, we got our cash flow schedule. And then I felt like part of this one was answered, I felt like part of all of these were answered, actually, but I wanted a little bit more detail. So I kind of just focused on this one next. I asked Jim and I, I basically just said, run code that gets me this. And I got it working first try. So we get our payback schedule here. Again, we get the same net present value, same internal rate of return as above. And then that simple payback is basically just the time for a project's cash inflows to equal its initial investment. So it's telling us it's 5.28 years. And you can kind of see that from that cumulative free cash flow, you can see that minus 500,000 when that switches over to positive, which is this 1.3 million here in between five and six there. That's how we're getting this 5.28 years. And then that discounted payback rate is just, it's basically the same thing as the simple payback, except this is accounting for time value money. So then that's kind of why it's taking a little bit longer to pay it back. And that's why we see that right here, kind of in between the year eight and year nine. Again, looking from when this negative switches to positive. And then there's that profitability index, which is the present value of future cash flows divided by that initial investment. So for this one specifically, we're really looking for a value over one, indicating good profitability. So you can see 1.22, obviously greater than one. So profitability is good there. And then, yeah, so then it's asking for the sensitivity analysis, which the one above was a little bit confusing. It didn't quite answer these questions here. So I wanted to go a little bit more in depth, get a little bit more clarity with that. So I think this broke it down a lot better. And I didn't have to do a ton of digging outside of Google Colab for this one because it kind of just broke it down. The Python code gave a good analysis here. So we can see our base case is just our standard 8.55 weighted average cost of capital. The net present value with that, the internal rate of revenue. And then obviously this is going to be zero. It's the first one. So then you see how that changes if the revenue goes down by 20%. And then you can see that's the worst case by far. Our net present value is way in the negative. Internal rate of return tanks all the way down to 3.13%. You can see our net present value impact, huge, huge hit. And then you can see if that weighted average cost of capital goes down. That's the best result with our net present value kind of swinging up here, 1.5 million. And then if weighted average cost of capital goes up a little bit, we see that that net present value drops a little bit. We're still in the positive. But yeah, you can see it does have a slight negative impact. So again, kind of summarizing what I've been talking about, decline of 20%, absolutely catastrophic. And it gives a little insight, high fixed cost, creates operating leverage whenever new falls. Costs do not fall proportionally, kind of just showing those margins. And then, yeah, even if that weighted average cost of capital rises, the project still remains positive. It has enough of a buffer to withstand those costs. But obviously, it doesn't if the revenue plummets like this. So it's, yeah, it's kind of just summarizing here that, yeah, it's way more sensitive to sales volume because we see when that sales volume drops there 20%, it's detrimental to the company. Whereas with interest rate or with those rate hikes, it's not ideal, of course, but it still can withstand it. It's still profitable. So it needs to definitely worry more about this sales volume. And that's more so what you should be looking for. And then you kind of already have an answer to number four based on everything we've done here. But I just thought that this explanation was really good. It went really in depth here. And kind of just piggybacking off of what I've been talking about this whole time, what the code's been saying is that, yes, the project is financially viable. And then it gives, yeah, again, the same things I've been saying. The value creation to almost 2.7 million net present value indicates wealth generation. We're looking for really anything above zero here. Efficiency, again, we're really looking for this internal rate of return to be greater than the cost of capital or that hurdle rate that's going to show that the project is worthwhile, that you are going to be making a profit on that. And then the liquidity, just saying that the capital is locked up for 8.2 years. That's kind of what we calculated above with that discounted payback rate kind of in that table. And then, yeah, you can see that, I mean, this is a deeper level than just the numbers here, but it kind of reinforces Starbucks Authority and high-end coffee kind of competing with some of these other companies here. And then, yeah, again, just recapping what we saw. Sensitivity analysis showed that, yeah, a drop in revenue, absolutely catastrophic, kind of indicating that we have high fixed costs. Profitability would evaporate pretty quickly if that volume target is missed. So, yeah, again, while that 8.2-year payback period, that's a long, I mean, obviously, that's a long time to kind of get your money back, and including that time value of money, that's a long time. But again, this net present value, I think, definitely indicates that it's worth it for sure, as long as we're hitting our profits, we're hitting those sales, that way we have enough money to kind of cover these high fixed costs. I think this was a really interesting assignment because I wasn't really sure what to do initially. I was a little confused. It felt a little overwhelming. But kind of breaking it down section by section, doing a little bit of digging on the net present value on the internal rate of return, how that compares to weighted average capital cost, was really interesting. And then just kind of what these different payback rates meant, what profitability index meant, how ideally you want that to be greater than one. That was really interesting. And just kind of combining all these metrics to figure out whether this would be a good investment, whether this project would be worth pursuing, I think it's very beneficial. So again, kind of knowing that Gemini is a tool to analyze some of these companies, and even that Python code can go really in depth and give you a pretty good idea, whether this would be a good investment or a bad investment. Obviously, in this case, it being a good investment or rather the project being worthwhile for this situation.",
