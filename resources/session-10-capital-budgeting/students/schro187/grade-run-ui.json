  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code, that it executed successfully, and cites concrete outputs (NPV, IRR, payback). They also verbally connect those outputs to expected financial logic (positive NPV and IRR > hurdle imply viability; revenue drop catastrophically lowers NPV), demonstrating validated execution and matching assumptions—meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly described what the tables/visuals show, citing specific metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) with units (years, %, $) and narrating scenario impacts (revenue −20%, WACC up/down). Their explanations connect results to capital allocation trade-offs (revenue sensitivity vs financing costs, liquidity via payback), satisfying a comprehensive, concept-driven verbal walkthrough of the visual outputs. The DISCOVER–IMPLEMENT–EVOLVE stages support that these descriptions came from generated analyses and were refined for clarity.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly listed the models, metrics, and scenarios before coding (Discover/Represent) and then implemented them, producing matching artifacts (cash flow table, NPV/IRR, payback, sensitivity runs). This demonstrates a systematic linkage from plan to implementation consistent with the DRIVER expectations.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off or quantify tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Content focuses on a Starbucks project evaluation (NPV/IRR/sensitivity) with only a cursory mention of “tax shields,” not the required Apple capital structure analysis.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. It focuses exclusively on project valuation metrics and sensitivity to revenues/WACC. Given the absence of the required concepts, this criterion fails despite acceptable DRIVER activity in other areas.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission addresses operating leverage and WACC/revenue sensitivities but does not discuss financial leverage (DFL), effects on ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Under a moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but none is provided on financing choice or leverage math, so the criterion is not demonstrated.",
