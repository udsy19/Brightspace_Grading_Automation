  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined and applied NPV by discounting free cash flows at WACC and incorporating the initial investment, working capital, and terminal value, providing a base-case NPV and multiple sensitivity scenarios. The implementation evidence (code-run results) and reflection on WACC/revenue sensitivities show depth beyond basics, meeting the moderate standard for thoroughness. Minor timing ambiguity on working capital does not materially detract from the strong conceptual and applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to the base case and sensitivity scenarios, demonstrating when acceptance holds and when a negative NPV would imply rejection. Their WACC and revenue sensitivities show depth beyond a basic statement, satisfying a thorough, conceptually sound treatment under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero, computes a specific IRR, and applies it in decision-making relative to WACC. They further demonstrate understanding through implementation (code) and reflection via sensitivity discussion (including IRR’s independence from WACC), meeting a thorough, conceptually solid treatment suitable for a PASS in this moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly models key project cash flows (capex, WC changes, operating items) and excludes financing, showing basic incremental treatment. However, they do not explicitly address excluding sunk/allocated costs, opportunity costs, or cannibalization, and there’s minor inconsistency in WC timing. Depth is insufficient for a PASS, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly included working capital recovery and a terminal/salvage value, showing implementation competence. However, the terminal value was taken as a flat 3 million without explanation or after-tax salvage treatment (especially relevant given full depreciation to zero book value), so the treatment lacks depth. Under the moderate standard, this is accurate but incomplete, hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates personal execution (ran code), understands the NPV formula, and reports NPV and IRR results with sensitivity interpretation (PARTIAL). However, they did not provide block-by-block explanation of the code or explicit verification steps required by the strict Technical Implementation standard, so full PASS is not met.",

The operating cost, the cost of goods sold is 40% of revenue. The labor is 2.5 million. Rent and utilities is 800,000. Marketing is 300,000 in year one and then 100,000 every year after. Um depreciation is 12 million and over the 10 years that makes it 1.2 million per year.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clear problem statement and objective framing; Implement — code and computation comments showing how results were produced; Reflect — sensitivity discussion (revenue risk) and final recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides a clear problem statement, comprehensive assumptions with numeric detail, documented calculations/results (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity), and shows the code used to generate outputs. Combined Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages demonstrate thorough, well-explained communication consistent with a PASS."
