  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirmed running the code and pointed to the outputs produced by that code, and they verbally linked key assumptions/formulas to the resulting metrics (NPV, IRR) and performed sensitivity checks. This meets the criterion thoroughly under the moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student repeatedly and clearly narrates what the charts and tables show, citing specific values, units ($ millions, %, years), and scenarios (e.g., -20% revenue, WACC at 10.5%). They describe multiple visuals (revenue projections, FCF graph, NPV–WACC chart, sensitivity tables) and link results to decision implications and capital constraints. Under moderate standards, this depth and clarity merits a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the problem statement and objectives at the beginning, then proceeds to revenue projections, cash flow modeling, and code—demonstrating Discover/Define was completed before modeling. Therefore the student meets the strict requirement that D-stage be documented up front.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss the capital structure trade-off, quantify tax advantages vs. distress/optionality costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. Content centers on Starbucks project valuation and a depreciation tax shield, not debt tax shields or Apple, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different options. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics related to leverage or buybacks. The work focuses on operating cash flows and sensitivity, not stakeholder incentive conflicts, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, provides no DFL/ROE/EPS leverage math, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics (e.g., interest coverage, DSCR) when debt changes. Evidence shows focus on project cash flows and sensitivity to WACC/revenue, not leverage effects, which is required for this criterion.",
