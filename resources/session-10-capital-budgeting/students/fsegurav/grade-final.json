  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly defined year-by-year assumptions, described block-level implementation (dictionaries, loop, metric functions), and stated they inspected the resulting cash flow table and derived NPV—demonstrating personal execution, understanding of code components, and ownership. This meets the strict technical-implementation requirements for accurate cash flow projections.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly built and ran a sensitivity analysis with clear best/base/worst revenue scenarios (+20% / base / -20%) and varied WACC, described the code blocks used to generate cash flows and metrics, and validated outputs (reported NPV and plotted lines). This meets the strict requirement for personal execution, block-level understanding, and explicit scenario modeling.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student describes concrete programmatic automation (parameter setup, looped FCF computation, and functions for NPV/IRR/PI/payback) and automated scenario/sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough integration of tech in capital budgeting. Multiple applications and reflections on automation benefits indicate depth adequate for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly models free cash flows, applies WACC, and computes NPV with sensitivity analysis, showing conceptual understanding. However, coverage of NPV is basic and includes a decision-rule error (comparing NPV to $3M instead of 0) and unclear treatment of investment/returns, falling short of thorough, detailed treatment needed for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student misapplies the NPV decision rule by using a $3 million threshold rather than the correct rule (accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0). While they computed NPV and used it in decision-making (Implement/Validate), their conclusion relies on an incorrect cutoff, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student references IRR and reports a result (~13%), indicating basic computation. However, they do not define IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, nor do they show or discuss how it was computed or validated. The treatment is correct but brief, lacking the depth needed for a PASS.",

        "\"Some of the parameters are an initial investment of $12 million, a WC of $500,000 to be returned at the end of the 10-year period. Revenues for the first year will be 8 million, then from years 2 to 5 will be 11 as the product ramps up and then 9 million in the last four years as the product hype winds down.\"",
        "\"we're going to be following the driver methodology as always the define, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect.\"",
        "\"Some of the ways we can evolve and reflect this analysis. We can evolve it by adding a Monte Carlo simulation for revenue uncertainty... This strengthened my understanding of cost of capital and capital budgeting.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: clearly stated project goal and scope (cost-of-capital analysis of $12M roaster).\n- Represent: listed timeline, assumptions, variables (revenues, costs, WACC, tax rate).\n- Implement: described code structure, parameter setup, and cash-flow loop.\n- Validate: reported results (NPV, metrics) and compared outputs to expectations.\n- Evolve/Reflect: proposed Monte Carlo/sensitivity extensions and reflected on learning.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides detailed, specific assumptions, describes each DRIVER stage applied, computes and interprets metrics (NPV, sensitivity), and proposes clear extensions and reflections. This demonstrates a thorough, well-explained application of the DRIVER framework and strong conceptual understanding, meeting PASS standards."
