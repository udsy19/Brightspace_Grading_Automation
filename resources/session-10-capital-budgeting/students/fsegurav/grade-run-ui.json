  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case and multiple sensitivities (revenue ±20% and alternative WACCs), and explicitly compared NPVs across scenarios. They also identified the critical breakpoint where lower revenue drives NPV negative (even under lower hurdle rates), demonstrating stakeholder-preference implications. This substantive, applied sensitivity discussion meets the criterion under the moderate standards.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and invoked the functions, describes viewing the free cash flow table, and confirms outputs (revenues, proportional COGS, NPV) align with stated assumptions and expectations—meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the table and chart show, including specific values, units, and scenario definitions, and interprets the trade-off between revenue sensitivity and WACC. While explicit stakeholder impacts are limited, the thorough verbal description of visual outputs and scenario-driven insights meets the criterion at a moderate strictness level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off, provides no quantification of tax shield benefits or expected distress/optionality costs, and does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The DRIVER stages executed are about project NPV/WACC for Starbucks, not capital structure choices, thus failing the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss stakeholder agency conflicts, who gains/loses under different choices, or asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. It focuses on project cash flows, WACC, and sensitivity to revenue/discount rate without any stakeholder incentive analysis. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on WACC-based project valuation and sensitivity to revenue and discount rates, but does not discuss leverage effects on ROE/EPS, DFL, or bankruptcy/coverage metrics. Under the moderate standard, a conceptual discussion would suffice, but these elements are missing entirely, so the criterion is not met.",
