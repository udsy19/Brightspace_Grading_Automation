  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student presented a clear base case with quantified NPV/IRR, implemented multiple sensitivities (WACC ±2% and revenue down 20%), and explicitly identified the breakpoint where revenue decline flips the decision from accept to reject. Evolve-stage sensitivity analysis plus Validate-stage consistency checks demonstrate a thorough, actionable treatment of the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly referenced running Python code, reported specific outputs (NPV ≈ $3M, IRR 13.25%) and performed an independent mapping and logical consistency check that matched the code outputs. This demonstrates a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and aligned assumptions, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrates what the charts show, specifies units (millions), and explains multiple scenarios and their NPV results, demonstrating how capital allocation decisions vary with WACC and revenue assumptions. These detailed verbal descriptions across Represent, Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages meet the criterion thoroughly for a moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or quantification of debt tax shields, distress/optionality costs, or comparisons across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives, and it does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. The work centers on Starbucks project evaluation metrics. Therefore, it fails this specific criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identify divergent incentives or who gains/loses under different options. It also omits discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The work centers on project valuation metrics and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, leaving this criterion unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage effects, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. The work focuses on project valuation and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, so this criterion is unmet.",
