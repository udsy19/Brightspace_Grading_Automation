  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains NPV conceptually and procedurally, constructs appropriate free cash flows, applies the correct discount rate (WACC), and reports a computed NPV with scenario analysis. Multiple DRIVER stages support accurate NPV calculation and validation, meeting the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined the NPV decision rule, linked it to WACC and IRR, and applied it to accept/reject decisions across base case and sensitivity scenarios. Multiple concrete applications (base case accept; revenue-down reject; WACC shifts accept) show thorough understanding beyond a surface mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines and applies free cash flow as operating cash flow (NOPAT + depreciation) adjusted for capital expenditures (initial investment) and working capital changes, with correct timing of working capital deployment and recovery. They provide specific annual FCF figures and cross-validate them via code and an independent chart, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly defines IRR and applies it by reporting a computed IRR and comparing it to WACC. However, they do not show or discuss how IRR was computed (e.g., demonstrating NPV=0 at that rate or methodology), nor provide deeper analysis or sensitivity around IRR. This reflects correct but basic treatment, fitting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined payback as the time to recover the initial investment and reported both simple and discounted payback values, showing basic understanding. However, they included an inaccurate statement linking payback equaling project life to NPV being zero and did not provide deeper analysis or derivation. This supports a correct-but-basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly reported a profitability index and coherently built/discounted cash flows, implying the PI was computed and consistent with other metrics. However, they did not explain the PI concept or formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show its derivation, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documents key numeric assumptions (investment, working capital, revenues, taxes, WACC) and validates calculations by matching an independently mapped cash‑flow to the code, showing partial validation. However, they do not justify or source major real‑estate/construction assumptions (e.g., why $12M capex or $3M terminal value), offering only high‑level suggestions to refine projections; this lack of justification prevents a full PASS."
