  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and produced outputs (IMPLEMENT) and describes concrete validation steps (checking revenue–cost–tax–depreciation, tax shield) with reported numeric results (MPV, IR). They also discuss sensitivity testing and alignment of assumptions with outputs (REPRESENT & VALIDATE), demonstrating more than a brief mention—hence PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student specified models, scenarios, metrics, and risks before implementation (Represent) and then demonstrated linkage by running code, producing MPV/IRR results and graphs and performing sensitivity checks (Implement/Validate). This shows a systematic plan-to-implementation workflow, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed the planned analysis end-to-end: they ran code to produce NPV/IRR outputs, performed intermediate validation checks on cash flows, and ran sensitivity scenarios that link back to the Represent plan. These elements show a systematic implementation consistent with the DRIVER methodology.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs (buybacks/dividends/debt reduction) or quantify debt tax shields versus expected financial distress/flexibility costs, and it does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. Discussion of a depreciation tax shield within a Starbucks project and WACC sensitivities is unrelated to the required criterion. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. All discussion centers on project NPV/IRR, operating risks, and sensitivity, with no stakeholder incentive analysis. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never addresses how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy/coverage metrics. While WACC and generic “higher financing costs” are mentioned, there is no leverage math or analysis of downside risk from debt. Therefore, it fails this criterion despite a functioning NPV/IRR workflow.",
