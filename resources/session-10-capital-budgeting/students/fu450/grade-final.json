  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies project-caused cash flows comprehensively: initial outlay, working capital and its recovery, operating cash flows with depreciation tax shield, and terminal value, without introducing financing flows. Their Represent and Implement stages show correct incremental treatment and validations, meeting a thorough, moderate standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting calculations via code that computes NPV, IRR, payback, and PI, generates graphs, and supports scenario testing. They provided concrete outputs and described validation and sensitivity behavior, demonstrating thorough, integrated finance-tech execution suitable for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student models distinct cash flow phases: initial outlay with working capital, multi-period operating cash flows with phase-specific revenues/costs and tax shield, and terminal-year WC recovery plus terminal value. They implemented this in code and validated components, then evolved the model with sensitivities. The coverage is detailed and comprehensive enough for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines NPV, identifies all key cash flow components (initial investment, operating cash flows, working capital recovery, terminal value), applies a discount rate, and reports a computed NPV with sensitivity discussion, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, the treatment lacks detailed calculation walkthroughs and includes an accuracy inconsistency (tax shield stated as 0.3m with 1.2m depreciation and 20% tax), so the coverage is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links positive NPV to value creation and recognizes that a negative NPV under sensitivity would imply rejection, showing conceptual understanding of the NPV decision rule. However, they do not explicitly state the accept/reject rule or make a clear, direct accept decision based on NPV; the treatment is brief and mixed with other metrics. This supports a correct but basic understanding, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and reports a computed value, comparing it to WACC and observing limited sensitivity to WACC, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not demonstrate how IRR was computed (e.g., verifying NPV=0 at 13.25% or outlining the method), and the discussion lacks depth. Thus, under moderate standards, this is accurate but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.",
