  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly computed NPV from detailed free cash flows (including depreciation tax shields, working capital recovery, and taxed terminal value), reported the numeric result (~$2.7M), performed sensitivity analysis, and validated the outputs in Excel. Those elements plus the explicit planning, implementation, and reflection demonstrate a strong, comprehensive grasp of NPV consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined the NPV decision rule, computed a numeric NPV (~$2.7M) and used it to recommend acceptance, and demonstrated application via sensitivity scenarios (e.g., NPV turning negative with -20% revenue) and Excel validation. This is a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a numeric IRR (12.84%), explicitly defined IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero, applied it in sensitivity analysis (comparing to WACC), and validated outputs in Excel. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed systematic internal validation (Excel checks, recalculated NPV/IRR, corrected errors) and compared IRR to the WACC hurdle. However, they did not cite or compare results to any external trusted sources/tools beyond their own Excel verification. That meets partial validation but falls short of the criterion's requirement for external source comparison, so PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed systematic internal validation (Excel checks, found and fixed an error) and compared project IRR to the WACC hurdle, demonstrating validation of assumptions against the investment hurdle. However, they did not cite or compare to any external authoritative sources or tools beyond their own Excel checks, so validation is incomplete per the criterion’s external‑comparison requirement — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student used and validated the given internal projections but did not present or cite any comparable Starbucks store performance or external benchmarking data. The criterion requires explicit comparable performance data (external or peer benchmarks); since none are provided, this fails the requirement.",

        "\"I was told that the initial investment will be $12 million, and that will include the building, equipment, and training, and this investment will be depreciated using the straight-line method over 10 years.\"",
        "\"The constraints for this assignment are that I am limited to the data that was provided, but I don't think that should be an issue.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (documented capex and depreciation assumptions), Implement (applied the $12M capex in the model and depreciation logic), Validate (verified calculations in Excel and corrected errors).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented the key real estate/construction assumption ($12M capex, straight‑line depreciation over 10 years) and used it in the cash‑flow model with Excel validation. However, they did not justify or externally benchmark the $12M figure (e.g., market comparables, quotes, or cost references). Because assumptions are stated and applied but not externally validated or justified, the result is PARTIAL."
