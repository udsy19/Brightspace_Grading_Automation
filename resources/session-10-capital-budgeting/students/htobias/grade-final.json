  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly demonstrates NPV by defining it correctly, building comprehensive cash flows (including initial investment and working capital), and calculating NPV using WACC with a reported positive result. Validation in Excel and sensitivity analysis further support accuracy and depth. This exceeds basic coverage and meets the moderate standard for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines NPV, states the accept/reject rule, and applies it to the base case and multiple scenarios, including revenue downside and WACC sensitivity, demonstrating depth beyond a surface statement. Implementation and validation steps show consistent application of the rule, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student both computed IRR (12.84%) and demonstrated strong conceptual understanding by explicitly stating IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV zero and showing this on an NPV–WACC graph. Validation with Excel and correct interpretation across sensitivity scenarios indicate thorough, accurate treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student provides a clear, well-explained visualization of NPV sensitivity to WACC, interpreting axes, break-even NPV=0, and IRR, demonstrating sound conceptual grasp. However, only one key driver (WACC) is visualized; other drivers like revenue are discussed via scenarios but not visualized, leaving coverage short of comprehensive. Hence, correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The submission contains no empirical comparable-store performance data or benchmarking — only the provided roastery projections and qualitative statements about premium positioning. The student acknowledged data constraints and implemented analysis solely on the given inputs, so the criterion for providing comparable Starbucks store performance data is not met.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student calculated and compared project IRR to Starbucks' WACC and used a base-case benchmark for sensitivity analysis, but did not discuss or cite any industry benchmark returns for retail locations (e.g., typical IRR or cap-rate ranges for comparable retail/flagship projects). Because the required criterion—analysis against industry benchmark returns—is missing, the work fails this criterion.",
