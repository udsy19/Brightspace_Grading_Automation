  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%), computed metrics for each, validated results, and explicitly identified breakpoints where stakeholder preference shifts (NPV negative at −20% revenue; NPV = 0 when WACC reaches IRR ≈12.84%). This meets the criterion thoroughly.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they executed the code, reports specific metric outputs, and describes a systematic validation process (Excel cross-checks) including identification and correction of errors. These demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching of logic to results.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly and thoroughly narrated the tables and charts, specifying scenarios and units (years, dollars in millions, WACC percentages) and interpreting key lines and results. She linked the visualized sensitivity outputs to capital allocation decisions (accept vs reject under revenue/WACC changes), meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax advantages or distress/flexibility costs across financing alternatives, or connect conclusions to Apple. The only tax shield discussed is depreciation at the project level, not financing-related, and all content centers on Starbucks project evaluation, not Apple.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts, who gains/loses, or divergent incentives, and it omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. Content centers on NPV/IRR/payback, sensitivity, and brand strategy, so the required criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or calculations of degree of financial leverage, EPS/ROE volatility under different financing choices, or downside/bankruptcy and coverage risks. The analysis focuses solely on project cash flows and capital budgeting metrics; even at a moderate standard, the required conceptual leverage treatment is missing.",
