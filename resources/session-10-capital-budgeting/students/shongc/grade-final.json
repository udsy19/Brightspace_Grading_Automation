  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough NPV treatment: they structured free cash flows (including taxes, depreciation add-back, working capital, and terminal value), discounted at the 8.5% hurdle, computed NPV via a summation loop, and reported a specific result with sensitivity analysis. Their Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages show solid conceptual and applied understanding, meeting the depth needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the NPV decision rule by discounting at the hurdle rate, reporting a positive NPV ($3.02M), and recommending acceptance. They further demonstrated understanding by showing cases where NPV stays positive (WACC +2%) and where it turns negative (revenue -20%), indicating grasp of accept/reject logic under sensitivities. This is a thorough, applied treatment suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies FCF as after-tax operating cash flow with depreciation added back, then incorporates capital expenditures (initial outlay) and working capital changes (deploy at launch, recover at end). The timeline implementation and explicit mention of these elements indicate accurate, comprehensive treatment suitable for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed IRR using an iterative approach and reported a specific value, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not thoroughly explain IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate that NPV at the computed IRR is zero, nor did they explore nuances or provide deeper validation. Thus, evidence supports correct but basic treatment, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states a specific payback period and grounds it in a modeled cash flow timeline, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief—no cumulative cash flow walk-through, interpolation explanation, or scenario discussion specific to payback—so it lacks the depth required for a PASS. The DRIVER stages are present but the payback analysis itself remains basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student did not compute or conceptually discuss the Profitability Index (PV of benefits divided by initial investment). While they covered NPV, IRR, and payback, PI is absent across Implement, Validate, and Reflect stages. Given the moderate standard, a conceptual explanation would suffice, but none is provided, so this criterion fails.",

      "reasoning": "The student documents key cost assumptions (the $12M capex, straight-line depreciation, $500k working capital and its recovery) and implements them in the cash‑flow model, showing understanding. However, they do not justify or validate the reasonableness or breakdown of the real estate/construction cost (no external checks, contingency/estimation rationale, or cost-buildup), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
