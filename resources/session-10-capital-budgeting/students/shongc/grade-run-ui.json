  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included a clear base case plus multiple sensitivity cases (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%) and reported numeric outcomes (base NPV 3.02M, WACC+2% still positive). They explicitly identify a breakpoint—revenue −20% turning NPV negative—linking it to stakeholder risk and decision implications, demonstrating thorough treatment of the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and reports specific outputs (NPV = 3.02M, IRR = 13.25%, payback ~5.28 years) and compares them to the 8.5% hurdle, satisfying validation. They also describe core assumptions and calculation logic (timeline, revenues, depreciation added back to FCF, IRR algorithm), showing the verbal linkage between implementation and results.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states they began with the define/discover stage and lists the captured problem parameters and objectives, then describes mapping the project timeline and implementing the model—demonstrating the required upfront D-stage and its documentation. No evidence indicates the D-stage was missing or performed post-hoc.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, quantify tax shield benefits versus distress/flexibility costs, or connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet and risk profile. The DRIVER evidence pertains to project capital budgeting for Starbucks, not capital structure analysis, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any discussion of incentive divergence. It also omits asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The work focuses on project cash flows and sensitivities, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk and coverage ratios; analysis focuses purely on project cash flows and WACC/revenue sensitivities. Given the criterion explicitly requires leverage effects and risk coverage when debt is changed or maintained, the required concepts are missing despite solid DRIVER use for capital budgeting.",
