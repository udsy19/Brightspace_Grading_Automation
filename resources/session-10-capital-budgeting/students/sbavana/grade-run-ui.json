  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC shifts), uses a parameterized model to run them, and explicitly identifies a breakpoint (revenue −20% makes NPV negative and IRR fall below the hurdle), meeting the criterion with substantive analysis and interpretation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the code produced and displayed results, describes printing the cash-flow schedule and metrics, and ties key assumptions (WACC, initial outlay, depreciation, revenue shocks) to observed outputs and sensitivity outcomes. This demonstrates a thorough verbal confirmation of execution and validation consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a defined Discover stage (problem, objective, WACC) and states that representation (cash-flow sketch) occurred \"before coding,\" with implementation following. No evidence of a missing or post-hoc D-stage, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address capital structure trade-offs, provides no quantification of tax shield benefits or expected financial distress/optionality costs, and makes no connection to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. The work focuses on Starbucks project NPV/IRR modeling, which is outside the specified criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify who gains/loses across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks; financing/agency considerations are absent throughout.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, does not compute or discuss DFL, and omits bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Even under a moderate standard, there is no conceptual treatment of leverage effects; the analysis remains at project NPV/IRR and revenue/WACC sensitivity.",
