  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to both base and adverse scenarios, correctly interpreting positive NPV as value creation and noting negative NPV under revenue shocks. They integrate this into the DRIVER stages with implementation and reflection on sensitivity, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding suitable for a PASS in a moderate category.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly described representing the cash-flow timeline, implemented a parameterized Python model with a create_cash_flow routine (including depreciation add-back and working-capital recovery), and reported printed results plus sensitivity checks. These statements demonstrate personal execution, block-level understanding, and validation of the 10-year incremental cash flows, meeting the strict DRIVER requirements.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states the straight-line depreciation treatment and a 25% tax rate, and describes computing EBT → NOPAT → OCF by adding back depreciation, which is the correct procedure. They also indicate they implemented and ran the parameterized Python model and inspected the printed cash flows and metrics, meeting the STRICT requirement for explicit demonstration and ownership.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies NPV as the decision rule, computes it in a model, and analyzes NPV sensitivity to revenue and WACC, demonstrating sound conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the NPV formula, present-value steps, or numeric NPV results, so treatment of the calculation itself is basic rather than thorough, meriting a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes and uses IRR within a coded model and applies it in decision-making and sensitivity discussion, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not explain IRR as “the discount rate that makes NPV zero” and introduce an accuracy issue by implying IRR is recalculated “using a higher WACC,” which IRR should not depend on. Given moderate strictness, this is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and reported both simple and discounted payback periods and tied them to the decision context, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not detail the calculation method (e.g., cumulative cash flow crossover) or provide supporting cash flow evidence/threshold discussion, making the treatment basic rather than thorough.
