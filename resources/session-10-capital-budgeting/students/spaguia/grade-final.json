  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately computes IRR from the cash flows and uses it across base and scenario analyses, correctly noting its independence from WACC and applying it to the accept/reject decision. Multiple applications and correct interpretation in Implement, Evolve, and Reflect stages demonstrate strong conceptual and practical grasp sufficient for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly determined the time to recover the initial investment by calculating both Simple and Discounted Payback Periods and using interpolation, then reporting and interpreting the results. The work spans Implement and Reflect stages, demonstrating both correct computation and practical interpretation, satisfying a comprehensive treatment for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines FCF correctly as OCF less CapEx and changes in working capital and implements it accurately, capturing the initial investment, working capital deployment, and terminal recovery. The depth of application across a full schedule shows thorough understanding, satisfying a PASS under moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Although the student used NPV and tied it to WACC conceptually, they calculated NPV by passing the full FCF list (including Year 0) to numpy_financial.npv, which improperly discounts the initial outlay. Correct NPV requires discounting future cash flows and then subtracting (or adding separately) the undiscounted initial investment. This methodological error undermines accuracy, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes NPV and uses its sign in the accept/reject logic and narrative, showing basic understanding of the NPV decision rule. However, they conflate the NPV rule with an IRR threshold (requiring both NPV > 0 and IRR > WACC) and do not explicitly articulate the pure NPV accept/reject criterion in depth, so coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements the PI as PV of benefits divided by initial investment via PI = (NPV + |Initial|)/|Initial|, showing conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic with no explanatory discussion, and the NPV function appears misused by including Year 0 in numpy_financial.npv, which can distort PI.
