  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes documented assumptions and formulas, code that computes and prints core metrics, and an explicit validation message stating the PASS condition. The combination of REPRESENT (assumptions), IMPLEMENT (computed outputs), VALIDATE (explicit pass message) and REFLECT (recommendation tied to results) demonstrates the student ran and verified the code and explained how the logic supports the stated outcome.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The model includes built-in sensitivity testing with multiple scenarios (revenue shock and discount rate shifts), computes decision metrics, and explicitly states accept/reject implications. The reflection explains how these sensitivities affect risk and project robustness, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level despite not varying tax rate.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly labels and documents Stage 1 with a clear objective and parameters, and the implementation/code (modeling) is clearly in Stage 3 later. This meets the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a Starbucks project valuation and does not analyze buyback/dividend/debt reduction choices, quantify tax advantages or expected distress/optionality costs, or connect conclusions to Apple’s current balance sheet. Given the complete absence of the required capital structure trade-off analysis for Apple, this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: No discussion identifies stakeholder winners/losers or diverging incentives, and there is no treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics. The submission is entirely focused on cash-flow modeling and metrics, so it does not meet the criterion even at a moderate strictness level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility. It also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics under different debt policies. While WACC is used and varied, that alone does not satisfy leverage analysis, leading to a FAIL for this criterion.",
