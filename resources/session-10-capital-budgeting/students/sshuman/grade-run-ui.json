  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the mission, stakeholder focus (shareholder value), and hurdle rate at the start, then describes modeling steps thereafter, showing Define/Discover occurred and was documented prior to modeling. This satisfies the strict requirement for explicit stage demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated a clear pre-implementation plan (objective, WACC, capex, working capital, revenue schedule, depreciation, terminal) and identified metrics (NPV, IRR, payback) and scenario testing. They then connected that plan to implemented artifacts via iterative Python modeling and generated charts, demonstrating systematic linkage from representation to implementation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a systematic implementation: a coded Python model, traceable incremental cash-flow schedules (depreciation, taxes, FCF), and sensitivity analysis linking outcomes to the hurdle rate. These elements satisfy the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission performs a project valuation for Starbucks and mentions taxes and WACC, but it does not analyze capital structure trade-offs across buybacks/dividends/debt reduction, nor quantify tax shields versus financial distress/optionality costs. It also does not connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. Therefore, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. The work centers on NPV/IRR and sensitivity, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or DFL, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It focuses on project cash flows, WACC, and revenue sensitivity, with no leverage math or capital structure analysis. Under moderate standards, a conceptual treatment would suffice, but it is absent.",
