  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV is positive and notes that negative NPV under adverse scenarios indicates value destruction. They connect NPV to shareholder value and use sensitivity analysis to reinforce the rule, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting via Python, running a model that generated cash flow schedules, NPV/IRR/payback, and sensitivity outputs, and referenced core functions and parameters. They iterated the tool and discussed results and robustness, demonstrating a thorough, technology-enabled treatment suitable for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student presents a comprehensive, systematic investment evaluation: defining assumptions, modeling cash flows, applying multiple decision metrics (NPV, IRR, PI), and conducting sensitivity analysis tied to the hurdle rate. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Evolve) are evidenced through objective setting, technical implementation, and iterative refinement, demonstrating depth beyond a basic discussion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the discount rate, initial investment (including working capital), terminal/wc recovery, and reports a positive NPV, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the NPV treatment is not thorough: numbers are uncertain (“I think”), calculations are not clearly shown, and sensitivity statements are inconsistent. Under a moderate standard, this supports a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported an IRR (12.84%) and compared it to the hurdle rate, showing basic understanding and application. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero or demonstrate how it was computed; discussion remained surface-level. Thus, the evidence supports a correct but incomplete treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student only name-checks the “simple payback period” without determining the time required to recover the initial investment or explaining it conceptually. Despite having cash flows and charts, no cumulative cash flow crossover year is stated. Under a moderate standard, at least a basic, correct determination or conceptual explanation is expected; it is missing here.",
