  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies the discount rate, initial outlay, and multi-year cash-flow components (including taxes, depreciation, NWC, and terminal value), then computes and interprets NPV for the decision. They further validate via sensitivity analysis, showing sound application of NPV as PV of future cash flows minus the initial investment. Minor inconsistencies aside, the treatment is thorough enough for a PASS under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to the computed NPV to recommend acceptance. They also integrate analysis into their workflow (code execution) and reflect on sensitivity, demonstrating thorough understanding beyond a surface mention. This meets the moderate standard for depth and application.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly computed straight-line depreciation, described its tax-shield role, calculated year-10 book value and taxed terminal gain, and ran code to produce and validate cash-flow outcomes. These direct statements and code execution demonstrate personal implementation and correct treatment of depreciation and taxes (minor rounding in reporting does not negate the explicit correct methodology).\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an IRR and applied it appropriately against the hurdle rate, showing correct conceptual use and sensitivity analysis. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or demonstrate that relationship, making the treatment correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported both simple (6.83 years) and discounted (8.68 years) payback and offered a basic interpretation. However, they did not explain the methodology, show cumulative cash flow recovery, or state a payback cutoff, and there are inconsistencies in initial outlay details. This demonstrates correct but basic understanding, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported the PI and provided a sound conceptual interpretation (PV per $1 invested), showing understanding of the metric. However, they did not present the PI formula explicitly or show the PV-of-benefits and initial investment components used in the calculation, resulting in limited depth.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented numerical assumptions (initial investment, working capital, revenues, costs) and ran/validated the model and sensitivities (Discover/Implement/Reflect). However, they did not justify or validate the real estate/construction cost figures (why $12M, why $5M WC, terminal value choice or market/comparable basis), so assumptions are documented but not defended — meets PARTIAL."
