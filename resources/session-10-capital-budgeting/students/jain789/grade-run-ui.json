  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base-case and multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), explicitly identified that a 20% revenue decline flips the recommendation (NPV negative, IRR below hurdle), and validated results with model outputs. This satisfies the requirement for scenario/sensitivity analysis and highlighting the breakpoint where stakeholder preference shifts.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly confirms executing the code and reporting numeric outputs, and they clearly tied those outputs to the pre-stated acceptance rules (NPV and IRR vs. hurdle). This demonstrates valid code execution and that the logic/assumptions align with the reported results, meeting the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem and objective up front (Discover) and documents metrics used, then proceeds to run the code (Implement). There is no indication the Discover stage was missing or done post-hoc, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off of tax shields from debt versus distress/flexibility costs, nor does it quantify these across buyback/dividend/debt reduction options or connect them to Apple’s balance sheet and risk. The only “tax shield” mentioned is depreciation at the project level, not the debt tax shield relevant to capital structure. Given the absence of the required conceptual and applied discussion, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts across stakeholders or who gains/loses under different choices, nor does it address asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Aside from a brief mention of shareholders, there is no stakeholder or incentive-divergence discussion. Under the moderate standard, the required concepts are missing, so this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on leverage, DFL, ROE/EPS volatility, or how financing choices affect downside risk; it also omits bankruptcy risk and coverage metrics. Even at moderate strictness, a conceptual treatment is required, but the analysis focuses solely on project valuation metrics and revenue sensitivity, not capital structure effects.",
