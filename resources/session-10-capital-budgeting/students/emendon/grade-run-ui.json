  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue shock and WACC shifts), quantifies impacts on NPV/IRR, and explicitly identifies a breakpoint where a 20% revenue drop flips NPV negative—meeting the criterion and demonstrating thorough understanding.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports running and debugging the code, presents concrete numerical outputs and sensitivity results, and links those results to key modeling assumptions (e.g., NWC timing, revenue sensitivity). This demonstrates both execution and verbal validation of outputs consistent with the stated logic, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states they performed the Discover stage (goal framing and identifying financial components) and that this occurred \"before I write any of the code,\" followed by a Represent step and then Implement. This clear, sequenced reporting satisfies the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze buyback vs. dividend vs. debt reduction or quantify debt tax shields, distress costs, or flexibility/optionality, and it does not connect any trade-off to Apple’s current balance sheet or risk. Content is centered on a project NPV model (and even references Starbucks), with only a brief depreciation tax note—insufficient for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any discussion of who benefits/loses under different financing/risk choices. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics. The work centers on NPV/FCF mechanics and sensitivity, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss financial leverage, DFL, or how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. Despite solid capital budgeting work (FCF/NPV/IRR), the criterion is missing even at a conceptual level, so it does not meet the moderate standard.",
