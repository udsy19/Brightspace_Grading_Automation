  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, applied understanding of NPV by constructing free cash flows (including ΔNWC and terminal cash flow components), selecting a discount rate (8.5% WACC), calculating NPV, and analyzing sensitivity to WACC. The treatment is thorough and goes beyond surface-level mentions, satisfying the criterion at a PASS level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV is positive and recognize that negative NPV indicates value destruction. They support this with base-case acceptance and sensitivity scenarios where NPV turns negative, alongside discussion of WACC effects. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding appropriate for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student shows personal execution (debugging and running the model), block-level understanding of the implemented components (OCF, FCF, financial metric functions), and presents concrete NPV/IRR results with sensitivity checks. These elements satisfy the strict Technical Implementation requirements for correct NPV and IRR calculations.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and used IRR correctly (reported 12.84% and compared to 8.5% WACC), showing basic understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero or show how the calculation achieves that, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and computed both simple and discounted payback, reporting clear results, which demonstrates conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain the methodology (e.g., cumulative cash flow recovery logic), interpretation, or sensitivity for payback, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied the PI (reported 1.215 and used the >1 rule), showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain the PI formula as present value of benefits divided by initial investment or show how it was derived, so depth and thoroughness are lacking for a PASS.",
