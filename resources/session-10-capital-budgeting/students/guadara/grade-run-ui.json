  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a clear base case and at least two sensitivity scenarios (revenue and WACC), presents numeric NPVs for each, and explicitly identifies a breakpoint (10% revenue drop → NPV negative) that changes the accept/reject decision. The student also links the sensitivity findings to a concrete mitigation recommendation, demonstrating thorough, applied analysis.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student quantified sensitivities on key drivers (revenue, WACC) and interpreted how these change the risk profile (NPV turns negative with revenue shock, project robust to WACC). They also indicated model capability to test additional drivers (tax rate, WC, terminal value) and used results to evolve recommendations, meeting a thorough, model-integrated sensitivity/stress testing standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a Discover stage with key parameters and labels it as \"discover\" before moving into representation and then implementation/modeling. This meets the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented up front.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission focuses on a Starbucks project evaluation and generic WACC sensitivity, with no discussion of leverage/payout alternatives, tax shields from debt, financial distress or flexibility costs, or Apple-specific balance sheet implications. Even at a conceptual level, the required trade-off analysis is missing; thus the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any explanation of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. All DRIVER stages focus on mechanical capital budgeting and sensitivity to revenue/WACC, leaving this criterion unaddressed.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission never analyzes financing choice, DFL, or how leverage affects EPS/ROE volatility and downside risk, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. It remains at a project cash flow/WACC sensitivity level (Discover/Implement/Reflect) without any leverage math or stakeholder risk implications, so it fails this criterion.",
