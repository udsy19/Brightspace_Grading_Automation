  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly articulates the NPV decision rule (accept if NPV > 0) and applies it to the base case to recommend acceptance, while recognizing that a negative-NPV scenario signals rejection risk. They also connect the hurdle rate to NPV evaluation and discuss sensitivity impacts, demonstrating thorough, conceptually sound understanding across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated capital budgeting via a coded/AI-driven workflow that generated the full schedule, core metrics, and sensitivity analysis. Multiple automated components and outputs demonstrate thorough, comprehensive application across DRIVER stages. Minor numerical inconsistencies don’t outweigh the strong evidence of automation.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student not only quantified NPV sensitivity to key drivers (revenue and WACC) but also explicitly stated they created and showed a visualization, generated via a coded sensitivity function. The discussion interprets the visual outputs and links them to action, meeting the moderate standard with thorough, specific treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the NPV concept and formula, uses the 8.5% WACC to discount cash flows, incorporates initial outlay, WC, and terminal value, and discusses NPV-based acceptance and sensitivity—showing conceptual understanding. However, noticeable numerical inconsistencies (e.g., 3% of $8M listed as $3.2M; conflicting NPV/IRR results like NPV = $3.02M vs $5M and IRR 225.62%) undermine financial accuracy and thoroughness. Thus, this meets a basic but incomplete standard for NPV accuracy.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the IRR definition (rate where NPV=0) and provides an IRR estimate (13.43%) used for the accept/reject decision, showing conceptual understanding. However, the work is not thorough: the computation method is not shown and a contradictory IRR (225.62%) from the coding section is left unexplained, indicating inconsistency. Under moderate strictness, this supports a correct-but-basic, incomplete treatment—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates understanding by computing both simple and discounted payback and contextualizing the 8.21-year discounted result. However, the conflicting later result of a 0.4-year discounted payback introduces accuracy/inconsistency issues and the method is not explained in depth. Therefore, coverage is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented key numeric assumptions and used them in calculations (Discover + Implement), and reflected on revenue risk. However, they did not justify or validate the real estate/construction cost assumptions (e.g., the $12M capex, $3M terminal value, WC) with market comps, cost breakdowns, contingencies, or rationale—so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
