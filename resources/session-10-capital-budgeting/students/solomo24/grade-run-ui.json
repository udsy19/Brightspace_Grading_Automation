  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue and WAC), quantified thresholds where project attractiveness flips (explicitly noting a ~10% revenue decline makes NPV negative and larger declines destroy IRR), and discussed implications—meeting the criterion with sufficient depth.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the project definition, objectives, hurdle rate, and all critical input parameters before describing the modeling steps (EBIT and cash-flow construction). That meets the requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a pre-implementation plan (detailed cash-flow components and terminal/NWC treatment) and then followed it through in implementation (EBIT→OCF→FCF and NPV/IRR) with scenario analysis. This clear plan-to-artifact linkage meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs, quantify tax shield benefits or expected distress/optionality costs, nor connect conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet/risk profile. Content focuses on a Starbucks project appraisal, not Apple capital structure, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor identification of who gains/loses under different financing/risk choices. It also lacks any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Despite solid capital budgeting analysis, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion or math on financial leverage, DFL, or how debt vs. equity financing would affect ROE/EPS volatility and downside risk, nor any bankruptcy or coverage metrics. Given the criterion requires leverage effects and risk coverage, and only operating/project risk was discussed, this fails under the moderate standard.",
