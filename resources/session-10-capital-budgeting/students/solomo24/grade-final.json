  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student integrated AI tools to automate core capital budgeting calculations (OCF/FCF schedules, NPV/IRR/paybacks/PI) and performed automated sensitivity analysis, demonstrating comprehensive application. The coverage is broad and detailed enough to satisfy a moderate standard for thoroughness, aligning with the DRIVER Implement and Evolve stages. Minor inconsistencies in figures do not outweigh clear evidence of automation and integration.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student models multi-phase cash flows explicitly (different revenue/cost phases, WC deployment/recovery, terminal value) and describes constructing EBIT, OCF, and FCF over years 0–10. Despite minor formatting issues, the coverage is detailed and comprehensive enough for a moderate standard, showing strong conceptual and applied understanding of multi-phase cash flow modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly restated the project scope, provided the key numeric parameters (12M capex, 10-year life, 8.5% WAC) and enumerated the required incremental cash-flow components, then applied the hurdle rate to evaluate outcomes. Those explicit statements satisfy the Define & Discover requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding of NPV as the sum of discounted free cash flows using the 8.5% hurdle rate and references relevant cash-flow elements (initial outlay, working capital, terminal value). However, the presentation lacks detailed, explicit calculations and contains inconsistent NPV results ($1.6M vs. ~$3.2M), falling short of thoroughness required for a PASS. Hence, PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual use of the NPV decision rule: positive NPV at the 8.5% hurdle supports acceptance, and negative NPV in sensitivity signals risk. However, the treatment is not thorough: the explicit accept/reject rule is not clearly stated, NPV figures are inconsistent, and acceptance is argued partly via IRR language. Thus, understanding is evident but not comprehensive.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines IRR and provides an IRR estimate, using it to decide against the hurdle rate, showing conceptual understanding. However, IRR figures are inconsistent (11.23% vs 13.31%) and no computation detail is shown, limiting rigor and thoroughness. Under moderate strictness, this supports a correct but basic treatment, hence PARTIAL.",

        "\"The net present value... we get this value of about 1.6 million... IRR... is an 11.23% which is greater than the WAC of 8.5 making this project acceptable... For step three we're going to run the sensitivity analysis for a revenue reduced by 20%... the project is highly sensitive to revenue...\""

      "driver_alignment": "The submission demonstrates DISCOVER (identifying assignment requirements and the 8.5% hurdle rate) and IMPLEMENT (building the incremental cash-flow schedule, computing EBIT→EAT→OCF→FCF, running NPV/IRR and sensitivity analysis) stages of the DRIVER framework, showing application of the framework to the analysis.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly and coherently explained the analysis steps with specific numeric inputs and outputs (EBIT → EAT → OCF, NPV and IRR results) and performed sensitivity testing and a recommendation, satisfying thorough communication and explanation standards. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence shows a strong, structured grasp of the assignment and methods, meriting a PASS."
