  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (revenue −20%, WACC ±2%), reported quantitative outcomes, and explicitly identified a scenario (−20% revenue) that flips the recommendation. While they did not compute a precise breakpoint value, they clearly highlighted where stakeholder preference shifts and discussed the implications, satisfying the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran AI-generated Python code and that \"the script looked like it ran perfectly,\" and they perform multiple validation checks (IRR vs WACC, tax/depreciation logic, sensitivity behavior) consistent with expected results. These concrete validations across Implement and Validate stages demonstrate thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Define elements and then documents Discover inputs and risks before moving to Represent/Implement and running the model. Although the Discover discussion is brief, it is clearly presented prior to modeling, satisfying the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address the capital structure trade-off between tax shield benefits and distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction options, nor does it quantify these effects. It is focused on a Starbucks project NPV/IRR analysis and only mentions a depreciation tax shield, with no connection to Apple’s current balance sheet and risk profile. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it identify who gains/loses under different financing or risk choices. It also omits any discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting linked to leverage or buybacks. Given the total absence of these required elements, this criterion fails despite use of the DRIVER framework.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no leverage math (DFL/EPS/ROE), no discussion of how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or downside risk, and no treatment of bankruptcy risk or coverage ratios. The analysis remains at the project NPV/IRR/WACC level across stages, which does not satisfy this criterion.",
