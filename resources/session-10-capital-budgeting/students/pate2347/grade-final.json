  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough NPV treatment: they apply the 8.5% WACC to discounted cash flows, explicitly include the -12.5 initial outlay, terminal value, and working capital recovery, and report base-case and sensitivity NPVs. Validation links IRR and NPV and confirms correct cash flow conventions, showing solid conceptual and applied understanding across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly states and applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV > 0 at the WACC and reject when NPV < 0, also tying consistency with IRR > WACC. They apply it to base and sensitivity cases and ground their recommendation on NPV, demonstrating strong conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed IRR, linked it to the NPV profile crossing point, and correctly interpreted IRR relative to WACC, showing sound conceptual understanding. Multiple references (base case IRR, NPV profile, validation logic) provide thorough treatment appropriate for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reported both simple and discounted payback periods and tied the discounted version to the 8.5% WACC, then validated their reasonableness. However, the treatment is brief and lacks a detailed explanation or demonstration of cumulative recovery mechanics, so it shows correct but basic understanding rather than thorough depth.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included and reported a profitability index, indicating awareness and application. However, they did not explain the PI formula (PV of benefits divided by initial investment) or show its calculation or components, leaving the treatment basic rather than thorough. Thus, the work demonstrates correct but limited understanding, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly incorporated operating cash flow, the initial capital outlay, and working capital changes (deployment and recovery), demonstrating conceptual understanding of free cash flow construction. However, they did not explicitly define FCF as OCF less capex and ΔWC nor provide a detailed, step-by-step FCF schedule; coverage remains basic rather than thorough.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented the headline real estate/construction cost assumption (12.0M capex + 0.5M WC), the depreciation method, and incorporated these into model implementation and validation checks. However, they did not justify or validate the 12M figure (no breakdown, market benchmarking, contingency, escalation assumptions, or sensitivity on capex), so the treatment is correct but superficial. Therefore PARTIAL."

These stages provide the structure for clear communication and explanation.",
      "reasoning": "The student provides a comprehensive, stage‑organized explanation covering assumptions, detailed metrics (NPV, IRR, payback), sensitivity results, validation checks, and an explicit recommendation with caveats. While delivery includes disfluencies and minor inconsistencies, the substance is thorough and meets the moderate standard for clear communication and explanation."
