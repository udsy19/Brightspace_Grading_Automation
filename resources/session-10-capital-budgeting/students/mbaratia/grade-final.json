  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applied NPV using WACC to discount project cash flows, reported base-case NPV, and performed sensitivity to revenue and WACC, then tied results to an accept/reject decision. While not showing the explicit formula, the implementation detail and multiple scenario applications demonstrate solid conceptual mastery appropriate for a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the NPV decision rule: accept when NPV > 0 (base case recommendation) and implicitly reject when NPV < 0 (20% revenue drop). They use WACC as the discount/hurdle rate and explore multiple scenarios, demonstrating a thorough, application-oriented understanding aligned with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined and computed both simple and discounted payback periods, described the methodology (including cumulative discounted cash flows and WACC), and reported concrete results. This demonstrates a strong, thorough grasp of the payback period concept beyond a surface mention, satisfying the criterion under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR from project cash flows, reported a base-case IRR and sensitivity results, and used it in decision-making. However, they did not articulate IRR as the discount rate that sets NPV to zero and showed minor confusion (calling IRR’s constancy vs. WACC a “pretty big jump”). This reflects correct but basic treatment, meriting PARTIAL under a moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly includes and computes the profitability index, references appropriate inputs (WACC and cash flows), and provides a numeric result, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not define the PI as “present value of benefits divided by initial investment,” show the formula, or explain the calculation in depth. The treatment is correct but basic, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and includes key FCF components (operating profit after tax with depreciation, change in working capital, and net capex) in the cash flow schedule, indicating conceptual understanding. However, they do not clearly articulate the FCF formula nor explicitly show that FCF equals operating cash flow less capex and working capital changes; the phrase “free cash flow before those adjustments” introduces ambiguity. Given the moderate standard, this is correct but basic rather than thorough, so PARTIAL.",
