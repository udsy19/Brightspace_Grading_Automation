  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced a base case plus multiple sensitivities (revenue -20%, WACC ±2%), reported specific NPV/IR outcomes, and explicitly identified the breakpoint where the project becomes unprofitable (revenue -20%). Implementation and validation steps in the DRIVER stages support that the sensitivity analysis on key drivers was executed and interpreted, meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the functions, computed financial metrics, and performed targeted checks (year-5 revenue, COGS, depreciation) with concrete expected vs actual numbers that matched. The REPRESENT→IMPLEMENT→VALIDATE progression shows both execution and logical verification, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents listing and defining project parameters before moving to representation and implementation, meeting the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling. The clear order and quoted parameter list satisfy the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The criterion requires analyzing the capital structure trade-off across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, quantifying tax advantages and distress/optionality costs, and linking to Apple’s balance sheet. The submission focuses on a Starbucks project valuation with NPV/IRR and sensitivity; it contains no discussion of tax shields, financial distress costs, payout vs. leverage choices, or Apple. Even under moderate strictness, there is no conceptual treatment, so this criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no discussion of agency conflicts among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any treatment of asset substitution or risk-shifting via leverage/buybacks. All DRIVER stages center on project cash flows and sensitivities, not stakeholder incentive divergence, so the criterion is unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address financial leverage, DFL, EPS/ROE effects, or coverage/bankruptcy risk; it focuses solely on project NPV/IRR and operational/WACC sensitivities. Under the criterion, leverage math and risk implications are required, so despite solid project analysis, the leverage-specific requirement is missing, resulting in a FAIL.",
