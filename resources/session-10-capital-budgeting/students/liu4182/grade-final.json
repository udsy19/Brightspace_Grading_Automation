  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly defined and computed NPV, including the formula, discounting at WACC, terminal value, and produced a concrete NPV result. Their DRIVER flow shows clear representation before implementation and validation of assumptions, demonstrating strong conceptual and applied mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately states the NPV decision rule, ties it to the hurdle rate (WACC), and applies it to make the accept decision. They further operationalize the rule across DRIVER stages, including sensitivity analysis, demonstrating thorough and correct understanding suitable for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed IRR, correctly interpreted it as the project’s annual return, and applied the IRR > WACC decision rule. They further demonstrated depth by presenting IRR under multiple sensitivity scenarios, showing robust understanding and application within the DRIVER stages. This meets the moderate standard with thorough, example-backed coverage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and applied both simple and discounted payback concepts and provided explicit payback results, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, the stated payback periods appear inconsistent with their own cash-flow schedule (e.g., cumulative simple payback from $1.2M in Year 1, $2.7M in Years 2–5, and $1.8M thereafter implies >5 years, not 4.1), indicating a numerical accuracy issue. Given the moderate standard, this supports a Partial rather than a full Pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and included both salvage value and working capital recovery and applied discounting, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not account for taxes on the salvage proceeds (especially material given full straight-line depreciation), making the treatment incomplete. Hence, partial credit.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student explicitly demonstrates personal implementation and DRIVER stages, the reported numeric results are inconsistent with the detailed cash-flow items and discounting described (the summed discounted inflows implied by their per-year OCFs do not reconcile with the stated NPV/IRR). Under the STRICT Technical Implementation standard requiring correct, explicitly demonstrated calculations, these discrepancies mean the NPV/IRR calculations cannot be accepted as correct.",
