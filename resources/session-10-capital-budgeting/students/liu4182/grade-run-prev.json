  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explained and applied NPV, including initial outlay, phased operating cash flows, discounting at WACC, and discounted terminal value, and reported a computed NPV. Use of DRIVER stages to structure the formula (Represent) and execute calculations (Implementation), plus interpretation (Reflect), demonstrates strong conceptual and applied mastery suitable for a PASS under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defined the NPV decision rule, tied it to WACC, and applied it rigorously in both base case and sensitivity analyses. Multiple concrete instances of accept/reject decisions based on NPV demonstrate thorough, conceptually sound understanding, meeting the PASS standard for a moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed IRR (17.3%) but also interpreted it against the hurdle rate and explored IRR across scenarios, demonstrating depth. Their explicit link between zero NPV and earning the discount rate shows correct conceptual grounding of IRR as the rate that sets NPV to zero. The Implementation and Validation stages provide thorough, accurate treatment, meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and applies both simple and discounted payback, showing conceptual understanding and using them in the decision. However, the stated simple payback (4.1 years) conflicts with the provided cash flow timeline (which implies recovery occurs after Year 5), and no calculation steps are shown to reconcile this. Due to this accuracy inconsistency, coverage is solid but not thorough enough for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included both salvage value and full working capital recovery at Year 10 and discounted them, showing solid conceptual understanding. However, they did not apply after-tax treatment to salvage despite full depreciation over 10 years (implying a taxable gain/recapture), overstating terminal value. This gap prevents a thorough PASS, so the criterion is only partially met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly conducted external validation conceptually—citing actual roastery performance and running thorough sensitivity analyses in the Validate stage—but did not name explicit external sources or referenceable tools/websites for those data. Under the moderate standard, this demonstrates partial compliance: validation is present and reasonable, but lacks the specific cited external sources required for a full PASS.",

These elements across Discover, Represent, Implement, and Reflect stages demonstrate comprehensive, professional handling of the 10-year project life."
