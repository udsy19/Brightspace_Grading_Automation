  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides multiple, quantified sensitivity analyses (revenue and WACC ranges), reports outcomes (NPV/IRR) at each step, and identifies breakeven thresholds where the decision flips—meeting the criterion thoroughly. The analysis is comprehensive and shows robustness testing consistent with a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they ran the code and displays concrete outputs (year-by-year cash flows, NPV, IRR, sensitivity results) while explaining how assumptions (e.g., depreciation tax shield, WACC) produce those results. This meets the requirement for verbal confirmation of valid code execution and matching explanation of logic, so the submission passes.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly narrates visuals/tables, explicitly stating results, units ($, %, years), and scenario ranges for revenue and WACC, and explains trade-offs (breakeven thresholds, tolerance to WACC). The descriptions are clear, detailed, and tied to decision-making and stakeholder perspectives, meeting and exceeding the criterion under a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission does not address the required capital structure trade-off or alternatives (buyback/dividend/debt reduction) and provides no linkage to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. While tax effects are discussed, they pertain to depreciation, not the interest tax shield central to this criterion. The DRIVER stages executed are project-evaluation oriented and explicitly defer financing choices, leaving this criterion unmet.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: - The submission does not identify who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor explain divergent incentives. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks, explicitly deferring financing issues, so the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on project NPV/IRR, revenue/WACC sensitivities, and WACC definition, but does not discuss leverage math (DFL), EPS/ROE volatility, or stakeholder risk preferences, nor does it address bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics under different debt policies. Given the absence of any financing-choice analysis, the criterion is not met.",
