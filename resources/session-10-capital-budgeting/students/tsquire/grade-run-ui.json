  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case (NPV/IRR) and a concrete sensitivity/breakpoint (break‑even initial outlay ~31.9–32.0M) and interpreted how that breakpoint changes the accept/reject decision. They also proposed additional scenario tests. This meets the criterion (base + one sensitivity and highlighted decision breakpoint) at a thorough, conceptually clear level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports successful code execution with printed results and documents iterative debugging (IMPLEMENT). They then validate outputs against the rubric (VALIDATE) and provide the OCF formula and assumptions (REPRESENT), showing the logic behind the differing values. This is a thorough verbal confirmation of valid code execution and result validation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the problem/objective (Discover) and then immediately lists key financial parameters (Define) prior to describing the modeling and code (Represent/Implement). Because the D-stage is documented up front and precedes modeling, the student meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze capital structure trade-offs, quantify interest tax shield benefits, or assess financial distress/flexibility costs across buyback/dividend/debt reduction alternatives. It also does not connect any conclusions to Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile. The only “tax shield” discussed is depreciation at the project level for Starbucks, which is unrelated to the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss agency conflicts among stakeholders, does not identify divergent incentives or who gains/loses, and does not explain asset substitution or risk shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Mention of “shareholder value” is insufficient for this criterion under the moderate standard, which still requires a conceptual treatment of these conflicts.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not discuss degree of financial leverage, how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility, or downside/bankruptcy risk with coverage metrics. Aside from a vague bankruptcy remark, there is no leverage math, no DFL, and no linkage to stakeholder risk preferences. Under the moderate standard, conceptual treatment would suffice, but the topic is essentially missing.",
