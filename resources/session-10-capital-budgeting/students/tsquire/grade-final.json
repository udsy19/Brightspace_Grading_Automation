  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the NPV accept/reject rule, connects it to value creation and the firm’s WACC, and applies it to the case with a computed negative NPV leading to a reject decision. They also extend the application by discussing the break-even outlay (NPV=0 threshold), demonstrating thorough understanding. The DRIVER stages show a coherent path from framing the NPV rule to implementing calculations and making the decision.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly describes running and iterating the code, explains block-by-block how the FCF stream and OCF are computed, and reports verified outputs (NPV and IRR) plus validation of an intermediate cash flow. Although AI assistance was used, the student demonstrates personal execution, understanding of the calculation steps, and ownership of results—meeting the strict requirements for this technical criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated capital budgeting calculations by coding an end-to-end model that constructs cash flows, computes NPV/IRR/break-even, and outputs results, demonstrating troubleshooting and dependency management. They also linked the automated outputs to further scenario analysis. The depth and specificity meet a thorough, technology-integrated treatment suitable for PASS under moderate strictness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student demonstrates the NPV concept by assembling cash flows, discounting using WACC, computing NPV, and interpreting its sign for the decision. However, inconsistencies in the initial outlay ($12m vs $32.5m) and unresolved OCF discrepancies indicate gaps that limit thoroughness and accuracy. Therefore, the treatment is correct but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied IRR (6.82%) and compared it to WACC, showing basic conceptual understanding. However, they did not explain IRR as the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero, nor provide a thorough discussion of its computation beyond using library functions, with minor confusion in terminology. Thus, evidence supports a correct but basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never calculates or discusses the payback period or the time needed to recover the initial investment. Their analysis centers on NPV, IRR, and a “break-even initial outlay,” omitting the payback metric entirely. Under the moderate standard, conceptual discussion would suffice, but it is missing, so this criterion fails.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover: student framed the problem and listed key input assumptions (project life, WACC, initial outlay, depreciation, tax, terminal CF).  \nImplement: student coded the financial model using those assumptions and produced NPVs/OCFs for validation.  \nReflect: student compared model outputs to rubric validation, noted discrepancies, and recommended next steps.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly documented core assumptions (life, WACC, initial outlay, depreciation, tax, terminal cash flow) and implemented a model to validate cash flows (notably year‑3 OCF). However, they did not thoroughly justify the origins or reasonableness of the real estate/construction cost assumptions (no breakdown or sourcing of the $32.5M or explanation of depreciation choice), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
