  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided a base case plus multiple downside sensitivities (−10%, −20%), computed a numeric break-even (≈13.3% revenue drop) and connected that breakpoint to acceptance risk, satisfying the criterion. Evidence shows the DRIVER workflow (Represent/Implement/Validate) was used to generate and verify the sensitivity analysis.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they used and presented Python code, reports specific computed results, and documents finding and fixing a code error plus conducting sensitivity/break‑even checks. These steps show thorough verbal confirmation of execution and validation and link assumptions/logic to the reported outcomes.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly shows a defined Discover stage with objectives and project parameters presented up front, followed by a separate Represent/modeling stage, meeting the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and documented before modeling. Evidence is direct and unambiguous, so the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze the capital structure trade-off (tax shield vs. financial distress/flexibility) across buyback/dividend/debt reduction, nor quantify these effects. It also does not reference Apple’s balance sheet or risk profile; the work centers on Starbucks project NPV/IRR with only a depreciation tax shield, not capital structure. Therefore it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no analysis of agency conflicts, no identification of who gains/loses, and no discussion of leverage-driven asset substitution or risk-shifting. Content focuses on project NPV/IRR, sensitivity, and strategic branding, which does not satisfy this criterion even under moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not address how financing choice affects ROE/EPS volatility or compute DFL, nor does it discuss bankruptcy risk or coverage metrics. While the DRIVER stages are present for capital budgeting, there is no conceptual or quantitative treatment of leverage effects, so the criterion is not met.",
