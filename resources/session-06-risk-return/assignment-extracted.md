## Section 6: Assignment - Portfolio Risk and Return Analysis

### Your Mission

You just started your first job and want to invest your \$10,000 signing bonus. Your colleague suggests going all-in on Tesla (TSLA) because "it's the future." Your parents say stick with an S&P 500 index fund. You want to build your own portfolio.

**Available investments with 5-year hypothetical historical data---**Use the real data if you want to make it more realistic and fun**:**
- Tesla (TSLA): Average return 35%, Standard deviation 60%
- Apple (AAPL): Average return 22%, Standard deviation 28%
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Average return 9%, Standard deviation 15%
- ExxonMobil (XOM): Average return 8%, Standard deviation 25%
- Vanguard Bond ETF (BND): Average return 3%, Standard deviation 4%
- S&P 500 ETF (SPY): Average return 12%, Standard deviation 18%

**Key correlations:**
- TSLA-AAPL: 0.65
- JNJ-XOM: 0.30
- TSLA-JNJ: -0.10
- Stocks-Bonds: -0.20

**Questions to explore:**
What happens to risk when you combine Tesla with bonds? Can you build a portfolio that beats the S&P 500's return with less risk? What's the optimal mix for someone your age? How does correlation create the "free lunch" of diversification?

### Approach: The DRIVER Framework

Let DRIVER guide you through the complexity of portfolio construction.

#### Using DRIVER to Guide Your Analysis

**Define & Discover:** What's your investment goal? What risks concern you most?

**Represent:** Visualize returns, volatility, and correlations before optimizing.

**Implement:** Build your portfolio analysis with real historical data.

**Validate:** Compare your portfolio metrics with benchmarks like the S&P 500.

**Evolve:** How does changing the mix affect risk and return?

**Reflect:** What surprised you about diversification benefits? Can the historical returns and correlations predict the future?

### What You'll Create

1. **A video** explaining your portfolio construction journey
2. **Your Python notebook** with analysis and visualizations
3. **A transcript** of your video
4. **Any additional materials** your instructor requests

### Video Guidelines

Your video should demonstrate your understanding:
- Show you understand the concepts - that's what matters
- Walk through your logic clearly
- Explain it like teaching a friend who's new to finance
- Show your working code and explain what it does
- Demonstrate how you verified your results
- Share what you learned - the "aha" moments that clicked for you

### AI Collaboration

AI can help gather historical data and verify calculations. Your insights about risk tolerance and portfolio construction should come from your own analysis.

---

### Key Concepts to Explore

Focus on what reveals portfolio dynamics:
- **Historical returns and volatility**
- **Correlation matrices** between assets
- **Efficient frontier** visualization
- **Risk measures** (standard deviation, beta, Sharpe ratio)
- **Rebalancing effects**

Show how individual stocks combine to create portfolio characteristics.

### A Note on Learning

This is where modern portfolio theory becomes real. You'll see firsthand how correlation creates the "free lunch" of diversification.

The gap between theory and practice becomes clear when you work with actual data. Market correlations change, especially during crises, teaching you why portfolio construction is both science and art.

**Remember: Risk isn't just volatility - it's the chance of not meeting your goals. Understanding portfolio dynamics helps you build better solutions.**
