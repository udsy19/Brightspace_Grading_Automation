Hey Dr. Zhang, how are you? My name is

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Tomas Gomez and this is my section six

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
assignment portfolio risk and return

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
analysis.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,880
So for this assignment, our mission is

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
uh that we just started our first job

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
and receive a 10,000 signing bonus and

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,160
are deciding where to invest our money.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,119
We're looking at different options

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:33,360
between stocks and bonds. We have the

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,880
data for the following uh companies.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,320
Tesla with an average return of 35% and

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,840
a standard deviation of 60%. Apple 22

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,399
and 28. Johnson Johnson Exon Mobile uh

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Bangard bond ETF which are are bonds

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,079
which are different from stocks with an

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,000
average return of 3% and a standard

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,600
deviation of 4% and the S&P 500 which is

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,840
a um picks of a lot of companies. So

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
let's go over some some of the

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,640
definitions. Well, first the the return

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
is how much are you on average these

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
companies gave in return to the people

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,840
that invested. So for Tesla, for

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:26,119
example, if I if I invested $1,000, then

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,119
I would be getting back $1,350.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,240
That's what the average return is

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,040
showing. Um and the standard deviation

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,119
is the risk that you are taking when

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,759
investing in that company. The higher

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
the standard deviation, the more risky

32
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,560
it is to invest in that company. So for

33
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,520
Tesla, it is a standard deviation of

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,119
60%. Which shows the ups and downs that

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,320
the company has. Um, so of course the

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,479
ones that have a higher return have a

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,880
higher risk and the ones that have a

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,920
lower return like the bonds have a much

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,880
lower risk or much safer investments.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,160
Um, obviously all of these are uh

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,080
hypothetical information uh and they may

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,160
change. So they can the average return

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,120
can be 35 but you can get 26 in one year

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
or 40 in one year or even lose money. So

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
that's something to take into account.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,000
And then there are the correlations

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,720
which is how do the companies relate to

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,280
each other uh in relation to the market.

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
So for example Tesla and Apple have a

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
correlation of 65%.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Which is a positive correlations.

52
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
Correlation can go from negative one to

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,560
one. If it's a one means that the

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
companies move perfectly together all

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,319
the time in the market when one goes up

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
the other goes up one goes down the

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,920
other goes down.

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
Um,

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,519
and if it's negative one means that they

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
move perfectly opposite. One goes up,

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,120
the other goes down. One goes down, the

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,200
other goes up. And they're closer to

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
zero means they're more unrelated. You

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,000
know, they each one have their separate

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
movement. So Tesla and Apple have 65%.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Because, you know, they're both tech

67
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,319
companies. So they move pretty

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,360
similarly. Then uh uh Johnson Johnson

69
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,800
and Exon Mobile move in 30% which is

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,319
still positive but not as not as

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,159
related. It each takes their own path

72
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,519
and Tesla and Johnson and Johnson

73
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,920
have a negative 10 which means that they

74
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,480
offset each other. When one goes up the

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,959
other goes down a little bit and vice

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,000
versa which is similar to what happens

77
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,799
between stocks and bonds. uh the bond

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,640
this bond uh with all the stocks has a

79
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,480
correlation of negative 20%. Uh which

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:58,480
means that for every time one goes up

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,439
the bond goes down 20% or vice versa.

82
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,760
So just going over some some quick

83
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:09,439
information. What is our investment goal

84
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:12,560
here? Um, our goal is to grow wealth

85
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,319
over time and build long-term financial

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
independence.

87
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,680
Um, as I say, our first job, we don't

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,479
need uh immediate income and we have a

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
lot of time left to make our money grow.

90
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,240
Oh,

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
so those are those is key information

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
that we're going to take into account.

93
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,520
So our goal is long-term capital

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,800
appreciation with controlled risk

95
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,160
instead of gambling and short-term wins.

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,120
Then what risks may concern of may

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,240
concern us the most about here? Uh where

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
there are risks such as volatility risk

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
uh market which is that the value

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
fluctuates dramatically. The market risk

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
which is that the overall economy falls.

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,040
There's the concentration risk which is

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
that you put too much money in one

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,840
single stock. There's the inflation risk

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,080
obviously that money has less purchasing

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,120
power and there's the emotional risk. Um

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,240
in this case I think the ones that

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,440
should concern us the most are

109
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,759
concentration risk and emotional risk

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,080
because first as time is our biggest

111
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,600
advantage. uh you know we just started

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,680
our first job probably in our early 20s.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,199
M we can recover from downturns that can

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,759
be like market downturns or volatility

115
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,800
in we can recover from those sort of

116
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,759
things because we have time um but we

117
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,320
should avoid concentration and emotional

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
panic because I mean panicking and

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
selling low which is the emotional risk

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
we shouldn't do that we should avoid it

121
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,160
and concentration risk too

122
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,720
uh we shouldn't put too much in one

123
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,720
single stock and risk it all. Yeah. Um

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
just

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,319
what happens uh when you combine Tesla

126
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:12,319
with bonds that um I'll go over that in

127
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,960
more depth uh later on. But uh it's

128
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
where diversification starts working its

129
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,000
magic because Tesla's a high risk high

130
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,440
return and bonds are low risk low return

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,319
and their correlation is -20

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,120
uh negative0.20 meaning that they move

133
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,840
slightly opposite. So when Tesla drops

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,800
bonds might rise a little partially

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,600
offsetting our losses. So for example,

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,360
if we have a portfolio that's 70% Tesla

137
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,479
and 30% bonds, it still earns strong

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,800
returns since Tesla dominates, but it

139
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,919
has a much slower performance than

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Tesla. It's much much smoother

141
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,560
performance than Tesla alone because it

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,639
it's backed up. Then uh can we beat the

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,199
a a portfolio that beats the S&P 500s

144
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:08,000
which less risk and more return? Uh the

145
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,440
answer is we definitely can

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,440
but uh I will go into that later when we

147
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,240
get to to to the code. And then what

148
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,000
will be the optimal mix for somebody our

149
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
age? Well, again, we're in our early

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,759
20s, so we can handle more risk, but we

151
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,560
we still need enough safety to keep

152
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:34,080
investing through downturns. So, there's

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,400
this classic rule that is 110 minus your

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,360
age is the percentage that you should

155
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,000
invest in stocks and the rest is goes

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,919
into bonds. So, the older you are, the

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,919
uh less you invest in stocks, the more

158
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,800
you invest in bonds because you need

159
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,840
more safety. Or we can also apply the

160
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,720
glide rule which I will which which

161
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,720
shows that which which talks about that

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,680
if we're if we take into account that

163
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,199
we're 20 years old we should invest

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,800
around 17% of our money in bonds and the

165
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:11,919
other 83% in stocks. But I'll also go

166
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,479
over that uh later. And now for for this

167
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,479
final section of the of the first

168
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:22,240
analysis is I'm I'm going to go over how

169
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,560
does correlation create the free lunch

170
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,560
of diversification.

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,159
There's this quote that says that

172
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:37,360
diversification is the only free lunch

173
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,479
in finance. And the reason why is that

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,560
when two assets uh don't move together,

175
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,200
which means they have low correlation,

176
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,640
their ups and downs offset each other.

177
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,399
When one does good, the when one is bad,

178
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
the other one may be good and vice

179
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,000
versa. So they offset each other. So the

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,920
portfolio's total risk before so the

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,720
portfolio's total risk becomes lower

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,040
than the average risk of the separate

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,519
parts but the expected return is barely

184
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
dropping compared to what the risk is is

185
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,800
dropping and sometimes it even stay the

186
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,959
same. For example, if we combine Tesla,

187
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
which is high risk, which with bonds

188
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,279
that are low risk, they're have a a

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,040
correlation of negative0.20.

190
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,399
So, it's an opposite direction. So, it's

191
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,279
a smoother smoother total performance

192
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,480
because you still capture part of

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,160
Tesla's upside. You know, their

194
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,040
strong rewards, but uh you soften its

195
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,320
crashes whenever it it goes down because

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,000
it is going to go down.

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay. So, now we'll get into into the

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,040
code part. I first went to Google Gemini

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,800
uh told it what I needed. You know, I

200
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,240
need to write a simple Python code with

201
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,959
a 10K sign in bonus. Get it gave it all

202
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,519
the information. Um and then specified

203
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,080
what I needed a two asset portfolio

204
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,440
simulation only using uh Tesla and bonds

205
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,079
uh where Tesla's weight may vary from

206
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:24,959
zero to 100% in 10% steps. uh so that I

207
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,360
know how can it uh it vary depending on

208
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,440
how much you invest

209
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
uh

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,360
uh I I am asking it to use uh detailed

211
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,360
and in-depth concepts like uh sharp

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
points and mean variance sub

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
optimization

214
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,600
uh to understand the uh efficient

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
frontier for all successes like what

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,200
would happen if all successes I gave you

217
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
all the information the glide rule

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,560
constraint

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,720
and then it finally gave me

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,800
uh is put it closer.

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
This is the code it gave me. Well, of

222
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,760
course, it it goes over all the

223
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,519
information, the the sex equity uh

224
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
portfolio

225
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,120
uh makes all the calculations, the sharp

226
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:18,000
ratios, the the the volatility, the

227
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,240
risks and at the end this is what it

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,959
gave me.

229
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,440
So for the first part, we have a two

230
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,320
asset simulation

231
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,120
of Tesla and bonds. So it shows how

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,640
depending on how much I invest in Tesla

233
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,920
is how much I'm getting in return. How

234
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,640
much is the risk and how much is the

235
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,760
sharp ratio.

236
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:51,760
Um the sharp ratio just means um how

237
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:55,279
much return you get for each unit of

238
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,680
risk. So the higher the sharp ratio is

239
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,480
the better. Um so here for example when

240
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,800
we don't invest in Tesla just the 100%

241
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:11,920
in bonds we get a 3% return a 4% risk

242
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,240
and a 0 250 sharp ratio but then when we

243
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,240
start investing more like 10% we get a

244
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:24,160
6.2% return and a 6.35%

245
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:27,040
risk for a 0.661 661 or 66.1%

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,959
sharp ratio which is really good. And

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,720
then as we keep investing more we see

248
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,600
that the sharp ratio keeps decreasing

249
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,880
uh it peaked

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,880
at uh 10%.

251
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
So,

252
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,959
so yeah,

253
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,200
then I asked it to make a graph where

254
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:58,240
the blue curve shows the risk which is

255
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,880
the x-axis to the return which is the y

256
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:08,240
axis and then we have the uh the red

257
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,800
star which shows uh the best sharp

258
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,959
portfolio. video

259
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:20,000
uh which is when you invest 10% where

260
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:22,959
risk is 35 and 6.35 and return is 6.2

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,600
the sharp is 0.66 66.

262
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:30,240
Uh so this is the best sharp ratio, the

263
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,800
most efficient we can get a Tesla 10%.

264
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,800
And then the green star shows the lowest

265
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,720
risk uh of the combination of these two

266
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,639
which obviously

267
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,040
uh is where Tesla is 0% where you're not

268
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,000
investing in Tesla

269
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,240
but instead you are putting it all in

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,839
bonds that's the less risky you can go.

271
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,440
So the best mix here is of course 10%

272
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,959
Tesla 90% bonds is giving us the sharp

273
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,399
ratio.

274
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:05,279
Um we can also understand from this

275
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,120
chart that diversification works. You

276
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,279
know that there's a negative correlation

277
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,600
of negative0.20%

278
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:17,120
means that the combo of the two is safer

279
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,199
than the average of the two.

280
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,680
Um, we can also understand that more

281
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,720
Tesla isn't always better. Um, because

282
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
it it skyrockets the sharp ratio when it

283
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
gets to 10% but then it starts

284
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,920
decreasing

285
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,320
uh because the risk is increasing faster

286
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,839
than the return. So more Tesla isn't

287
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,120
always better. And here we can see the

288
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,000
free launch of investing because we can

289
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:52,000
raise the expected return by 3

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,160
percentage points from 3% to 6.2%

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,839
while the risk only rises 2.3 points

292
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,399
from 4% to 6.3 points. So that is

293
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,399
efficient diversification.

294
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:12,920
Then uh for the second part

295
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,920
we have the portfolio comparison.

296
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,800
So here we are looking at different

297
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
portfolios that we can build using this

298
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,560
information and which one is the best.

299
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,560
So the best the first one is the minimum

300
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,279
variance

301
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,760
uh portfolio which its goal is to

302
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,720
minimize volatility is to minimize the

303
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:41,680
risk that we are going to take. So the

304
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:45,600
minimum risk that we can take is

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,920
and of course this is of the six assets

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,839
frontier the six asset efficient

307
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,959
frontier. So the minimum risk return

308
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:59,360
risk we can get is the minimum return we

309
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:02,000
can get is four 4.3 per year which is

310
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,120
low but stable. Then the minimum

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,199
standard deviation is 3.35%

312
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,560
which is crazy because it's lower than

313
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,040
the than the return. So our return is

314
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,360
higher than the reward using a portfolio

315
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,560
that follows the the minimum risk.

316
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,720
uh the risk is only 3.35%

317
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,480
which is less than even bond heavy

318
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,440
portfolios.

319
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,199
uh then the sharp ratio

320
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,680
for this portfolio is 0.687% 687%

321
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,120
which is a great it's it's I mean it's

322
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,240
moderate efficiency for a conservative

323
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,639
portfolio which is really good and then

324
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:49,040
we have how this portfolio moves with uh

325
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:52,639
the spy which means the S&P 500

326
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,399
and this has a correlation of 0.0336% 0

327
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,639
33 36% which means that it barely moves

328
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,519
with the mar the market. So it's

329
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,400
essentially it's insulated from the

330
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,679
market swings. Then we have the max

331
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,959
sharp portfolio which is the portfolio

332
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,600
in which we are maximizing the risk

333
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,000
adjusted return which is the sharp ratio

334
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,439
when we're finding the sweet spot

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,679
combination between all of them. Um the

336
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:27,199
return using this portfolio is of 6.9%

337
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,720
while the risk is only 4.84%.

338
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,799
So there's a more than more than two

339
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,640
percentage points of difference between

340
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,799
the reward and the return and the risk.

341
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:45,360
Uh which is really really great. Here we

342
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,760
have a sharp ratio of 1.01%

343
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,760
which is just outstanding. It's

344
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,240
excellent. Uh anything above one in in

345
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,240
the sharp ratio is considered highly

346
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,520
highly efficient. So here we're

347
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,280
maximizing efficiency and uh risk

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:09,440
adjusted return. And it's really good

349
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:14,480
because the the beta is only 0.15.

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,880
Uh so it only moves about 15% as much as

351
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,559
the market does. So it's a really a

352
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,200
great option to take into account.

353
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,559
Then we have a portfolio in which we

354
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,600
have equal weight. What does this mean?

355
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,640
That a portfolio in which we invest in

356
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,640
all of our options in exactly the same

357
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,559
proportions.

358
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,720
Um each asset has exactly 16th of the

359
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:47,360
weight. The return is 14.83% so pretty

360
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,080
high but the volatility is 16.69%.

361
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,160
So we went back again to the risk being

362
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
higher than the returns because it's

363
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,840
high volatility.

364
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,200
This sharp ratio is still pretty high.

365
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,600
It's uh 0.769

366
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,760
which is good but less efficient than

367
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:10,559
others like this one. And the beta is of

368
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:15,600
0.4 4 456 which means that it moves

369
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,480
roughly half as strongly as the S&P 500

370
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,799
and then finally we have only the spy

371
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,160
the S&P 500 which we're using as a

372
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:29,120
benchmark to compare

373
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,400
uh it has a return risk of 12% uh a a

374
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,559
return of 20% a risk of 18% a sharp

375
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,240
ratio of

376
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,240
0.55 five six%.

377
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,240
So looking at this we can answer uh the

378
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,720
question we're talking about recently

379
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,880
which is if you can get a combination

380
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:57,600
that is more rewarding than the S&P 500

381
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,799
and less risky and we indeed see that we

382
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,039
can get that combination multiple ways

383
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,120
but one way is with the equal weight

384
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,679
portfolio which we're getting a return

385
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,720
of 14.83 83 which is higher than the S&P

386
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,679
with a risk of 16.69

387
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,919
which is lower than the S&P risk. Even

388
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,559
though this doesn't have the best uh

389
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,160
sharp ratio which is to the max sharp

390
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,960
portfolio,

391
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,120
it shows that it is possible to have a

392
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,559
more efficient portfolio than just

393
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,280
investing in the S&P. And if we were

394
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,640
were going to use this max sharp uh

395
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,520
portfolio weights, these are the the

396
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:47,280
percentages that we would have to use.

397
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:51,120
2.8% in Tesla, 6.885 in Apple, uh 13.42

398
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,960
in Johnson and Johnson, 66.97

399
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,880
in bonds. So pretty bond heavy.

400
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,000
And then uh 9.96

401
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,480
in the S&P 500. Then we have this chart

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,200
that goes over this is the efficiency

403
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,840
frontier. We can see Tesla which is high

404
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,480
risk high reward all the way at the top

405
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,440
and then bonds low risk low reward all

406
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,720
the way at the bottom. Uh and this is

407
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,960
where all of our portfolio sit. Uh

408
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
here's if you invested on lean Apple in

409
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,559
Exonent Mobile and Johnson Johnson the

410
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,799
S&P 500 is right here. Here is our max

411
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,559
sharp ratio. Here is a minimum variance

412
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,440
uh portfolio and this uh yellow figure

413
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,320
is the equal weight portfolio. So the

414
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,799
one the ones we were discussing.

415
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,440
Then here I tried to do about the the

416
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,120
glide rules

417
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:55,039
uh saying trying to find a a a a sweet

418
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,039
spot for the the glide rules. However,

419
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,880
it

420
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,799
there there was an error in the

421
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,919
calculation

422
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,640
uh because the system couldn't find a

423
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,640
exact sweet spot in which we invested

424
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:15,600
83.33%

425
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:17,600
of our wealth in stocks and uh 16.67 67

426
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,000
in bonds

427
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:26,640
um while still keeping each weight uh

428
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,440
positive and the sum of all weights to

429
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,600
one. It couldn't calculate it by by

430
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,520
itself. But using this uh graph over

431
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,520
here, we can uh we can think of it

432
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
ourselves

433
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,440
because uh looking at the max sharp

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,640
ratio portfolio from the task two, we

435
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,400
can look that it has around 33%

436
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,400
equities, you know, and 67%

437
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:05,520
bonds. Um so

438
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:10,080
if we were to make uh the the the

439
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,320
movement to the glide rule, we use we

440
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,640
would use the shape of the efficient

441
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,280
frontier to estimate what happens when

442
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,120
equity rises.

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,120
Uh so the frontier curves upward as you

444
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,760
move right. So there's more equity, so

445
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:31,840
there's higher return and higher ri"
37061012,adamayo,Aren Dominic,Damayo,"0:00
Hello, my name is Aaron Dominic and this
0:02
is my session six assignment for intro
0:04
to financial management uh with
0:06
professor Zang. And today we are going
0:08
to be uh we are given the prompt where
0:11
we have $10,000 for a signing bonus and
0:13
we want to figure out how we want to
0:14
invest that how we want to optimize our
0:16
portfolio uh in order to meet our
0:18
investment goals. So we first start off
0:21
um with the D of the driver framework
0:24
define and discover and we want to
0:25
figure out what are investment goals and
0:27
what risks concern us most. So, first of
0:29
all, we defined our investment goals as
0:31
outpacing the S&P's returns, making sure
0:33
that we're doing better than just if we
0:35
invested fully into the S& into an SE
0:38
S&P um like ETF like SPY. Uh we also
0:41
want to diversify our portfolio between
0:43
types of investments and sectors to gain
0:45
the benefit of diversification and also
0:47
to accept reasonable volatility for the
0:49
long term, at least 10 years, right?
0:51
We're young, so we know we have a
0:52
long-term horizon ahead of us. Um, and
0:55
then also we want to make sure that we
0:57
have enough risk where we're able to
0:59
utilize the fact that we're young, but
1:01
also not too high risk where we are
1:03
completely uh gambling effectively with
1:05
our money. Make sure that we're still
1:07
keeping risk to a reasonable degree.
1:11
And then some of the risks that concern
1:13
us the most, I would say, is being in
1:15
need of money during times of need.
1:17
Right? So if a recession were to hit, I
1:19
might be in need of money. And if my
1:20
money is tied up, if that $10,000 is
1:22
tied up in investments, um then it might
1:25
not be the most ideal place for it to be
1:26
at that time, right? I might need to
1:28
take it out. Um and that might not be
1:29
ideal, especially if investments haven't
1:31
gone down during these recessions, and I
1:34
might have to break that 10-year time
1:36
horizon that I had for this portfolio.
1:38
Um likewise another risk is uh not
1:41
having sufficient diversification which
1:43
leads to too much risk for the portfolio
1:45
because um whilst in individual stocks
1:48
and investments might have their own uh
1:51
risks through their standard deviations
1:53
um we need to diversify still because
1:56
certain stocks might move together and
1:58
if they move together then they're
1:59
likewise it's likewise going to be a
2:01
more risky portfolio rather than having
2:03
two stocks that are let's say completely
2:05
unrelated because of the fact that if
2:07
one were to go down and the other were
2:09
to go down if they're correlated. But
2:10
that same scenario won't necessarily
2:12
happen um with two uh two stocks that
2:15
are unrelated. And so diversification is
2:18
really important and if we don't have
2:19
that and we might really be hurting um
2:21
if we have all of our eggs in one
2:23
basket. And then kind of connected to
2:25
that is also sectors falling out of
2:26
favor for long periods of time. um
2:29
whether it be due to like business
2:30
cycles or um whether it be due to just
2:34
internal affairs that are occurring
2:35
within a sector like tech for example um
2:38
perhaps that sector for a few years just
2:40
happens to not have the best time and we
2:43
still invested into it beforehand. Um we
2:46
might have to suffer the consequences
2:47
for a while uh if that sector isn't
2:49
doing very well. Um, and that's kind of
2:51
important with the diversification
2:53
thing, too, because if we have all of
2:54
our eggs in that one sector that fail
2:56
out of favor, then we're going to be
2:57
really hurt. But if we have ourselves
2:59
diversify between sectors, then we might
3:01
be able to bounce off that risk.
3:04
And so, um, we were given some possible
3:07
data to use, but uh, I wanted to use
3:09
real market data uh, mainly because also
3:12
the fact that we did weren't given a
3:13
full correlation matrix and um, that was
3:16
necessary for my calculations uh, in the
3:19
code. So that's what I gave it here.
3:22
Um you can see here uh so what I used
3:25
was portfolio optimizer.com. Uh and you
3:28
can see that it gave us a correlation
3:29
matrix, annualized returns and
3:31
annualized standard deviations for all
3:33
of the investment asset options. Um and
3:36
these uh correlations and everything
3:38
were calculated based on monthly returns
3:41
from October 1st up until September
3:43
30th, 2025, just last year. So that's
3:45
five years because that was October 1st,
3:47
2020. uh for basically just about the
3:49
last five years. Um that's what it
3:51
calculated based off of and that's the
3:52
data that we'll be using for our
3:54
assignment.
3:55
So that moves us on to represent uh and
3:58
this was our representing plan. Since we
3:59
already have asset data um found using
4:02
external means uh that's what we're
4:04
going to use. So we wanted to utilize
4:06
that asset data. We wanted to then test
4:08
combos using the data differing weights
4:10
between investments everything like
4:11
that. I wanted to calculate a sharp
4:13
ratio uh for all of those options and
4:15
then using those sharp ratios find
4:17
optimal portfolios from those sharp
4:19
ratios and then for stage two I wanted
4:21
to then take those portfolio weights
4:23
find the best one and then compare them
4:25
to the S&P 500 as our benchmark and then
4:28
show that comparison. So with this plan
4:31
in mind we can move on to the IV driver
4:33
or implement and so uh we can see here
4:36
this is the code that we were presented
4:39
and if we run it we can see that it
4:40
works. You can see I already tested it,
4:41
but if you run it, we can see that it
4:43
works. So, it works well. Also, another
4:45
thing you'll notice, right, portfolio
4:46
one, it changes every time. And that's
4:49
because it's running a ton of
4:50
simulations and it runs new simulations
4:52
every time. So, we can actually get some
4:54
higher sharp ratios at times. But with
4:57
all of the simulations, we should get
4:58
relatively consistently around a number
5:00
one. And you can see here, it's
5:02
consistently around 1.18, 1.78, like
5:05
that high range, 1.835,
5:08
right? Right. If we run it again, 1.173.
5:10
So around 1.1.7 to like one point uh uh
5:14
one 1.185. So it's fairly consistent in
5:17
how high the sharp ratio can be. Um and
5:20
we'll see how it's doing all that here
5:21
as I walk us through the code. So this
5:24
first section, it's just um first of all
5:27
getting all of the data and setting it
5:29
up so that we can reference it later,
5:30
right? Um using that picture. So if we
5:33
take a look at the picture uh and this
5:35
kind of moves us on to validate just a
5:36
little bit by making sure that the
5:38
values are correct. So we can see of
5:40
course the stock tickers are correct but
5:42
also we can see that these annualized
5:43
returns shown here 2549 3250 1773
5:48
they're accurate because this would be
5:49
17.73%.
5:51
So that's accurate. Uh likewise with
5:53
here uh 6382
5:55
um I can't see it right now but
5:58
63828272524
6:02
those are accurate as well. Uh and then
6:04
we can see at the correlation matrix all
6:05
of these are accurate as well. Just
6:07
looking at the first row one negative
6:08
0.02.57
6:10
negative.00 negative0.02 again 0.23 and
6:15
0.51. So all of these are correct. Um
6:19
and uh I did check this on my own time
6:21
as well, but just to show you as well
6:22
that these values are indeed correct. So
6:24
that's good. And then also we did feed
6:27
it some assumptions that it did need. Um
6:30
for example, the risk-free rate we told
6:32
it that we wanted to use 3% as the
6:34
risk-free rate. Why? Because it was used
6:37
previously uh within the session and
6:38
it's used because it represents what
6:40
treasury bonds relatively uh generally
6:43
might be. And treasury bonds are
6:44
important because those are extremely
6:46
risk-f free or risk adverse I should say
6:48
or like have really low risk because
6:51
they are backed up by the actual
6:52
government. So the only way that they
6:54
would fail is if the government would
6:55
fail. And so 3% is a good risk-free rate
6:58
and that's necessary for calculations
6:59
later like the sharp ratio. Uh the
7:01
inflation rate is 3% and that's
7:03
important too because I wanted to do
7:04
some inflation calculations as well to
7:06
account for inflation and see what the
7:08
rates would be um and make sure making
7:11
sure that we're beating it as well.
7:13
Uh also some more uh information that we
7:16
provided it with is the fact that we
7:18
have $10,000 so it can calculate some
7:20
returns later on. And then this is the
7:21
other important part number of
7:23
portfolios is 50,000. So how it's
7:25
calculating the best portfolios is by
7:28
effectively running a bunch of different
7:30
simulations. Uh, so it's calling a Monte
7:32
Car called a Monte Carlo simulation and
7:34
it basically runs a simulation a ton of
7:36
times trying to figure out um or trying
7:39
to generate as many possible different
7:43
portfolio weights as possible in order
7:45
to then rank them and figure out what
7:46
the best one could be. So in this case
7:48
we're generating 50,000 and we'll see
7:50
how that how it does that later but we
7:51
can see that we're storing here that we
7:53
want it to be 50,000.
7:55
And then lastly for the general
7:56
information that will be needed in order
7:58
to calculate everything we then we first
8:00
need to calculate the coariance matrix
8:02
from the correlation matrix and using
8:03
the standard deviations. The reason why
8:05
the coariance matrix is so important is
8:07
because um as I mentioned with
8:09
diversification being so important um we
8:12
can get a much more accurate
8:13
representation of what the risk would be
8:15
of the portfolio as a whole if we use
8:17
the co-variance because from the
8:18
co-variances we can then derive the
8:20
portfolio's um
8:23
general risk or general standard
8:26
deviation right as a portfolio as a
8:28
whole considering the weights as opposed
8:30
to just fig like using the weights of
8:32
the investments uh using the weights of
8:34
the portfolio and then taking the
8:36
individual assets um asset standard
8:40
deviations and getting a more simple
8:43
version of risk there. And the problem
8:45
with if if we did it that way was that
8:47
it would be completely ignoring the
8:48
correlations between stocks, right? Uh
8:50
if stocks have a higher correlation,
8:52
they will move together. they'll move
8:54
together, which inherently might make
8:55
them more risky. Because if we put a lot
8:58
of money into stocks that are too highly
8:59
correlated and not a lot into the other
9:01
ones, then if that sector or if one of
9:04
those stocks were to tank, then the
9:05
other one will tank, too, and then we'll
9:06
be at a loss and we're not really
9:08
leveling off our risk. But if we have
9:10
stocks that are uncorrelated, then
9:12
they're not going to be related whenever
9:14
one goes down and one goes up. And then
9:15
that kind of helps us with our risk um
9:18
by leveling it off. And uh if one were
9:21
to go down, we might not necessarily um
9:23
feel as much pain from it because even
9:25
though we still lose on that end, that's
9:27
nec not necessarily going to happen to
9:29
the other ones unless it's something
9:30
happening with like the market as a
9:31
whole.
9:34
Um so that moves us on to the next parts
9:36
of stage one where here it's actually
9:38
doing the simulation first, right? So
9:40
that's what this section is. It's using
9:42
that 50,000 number in order to calculate
9:44
all those portfolios and in those
9:46
portfolios it's generating a bunch of
9:47
random weights and then for each
9:49
portfolio then calculates the returns by
9:51
taking the weights times the estimated
9:53
returns um or and not the yeah the
9:55
estimated returns based on the
9:57
historical data.
9:59
It also figures out the volatility and
10:01
this is what I was talking about by it's
10:02
using the coariance matrix and the
10:04
weights in order to figure out the
10:06
portfolio standard deviation or risk or
10:08
volatility as opposed to just simply
10:11
taking all of the individual asset uh
10:14
standard deviations and comparing them
10:15
to the loots. So this gives us a much
10:17
more holistic view of risk. Um and then
10:20
finally we can calculate the sharp
10:22
ratio. And the sharp ratio is extremely
10:25
important because this kind of shows us
10:26
our balance of risk and our balance of
10:29
returns, right? Of course, we're going
10:31
to want to maximize our returns because
10:32
we're rational people, but then at the
10:34
same time, we know that risk is a
10:36
factor. So, we want to be able to
10:37
balance them uh in order to make sure
10:39
that we are getting as much bang for our
10:40
buck whilst also making sure that we're
10:43
not just taking like a 50/50 bet or
10:45
something like that.
10:47
And then uh and that's what the short
10:50
sharp ratio does. So, we can check to
10:52
make sure that the sharp ratio is
10:53
correct. And based on the calculations,
10:54
it's taking the return minus the
10:56
risk-free rate divided by the portfolio
10:58
standard deviation. And that's correct
10:59
because that's what the sharp ratio is,
11:01
right? Sharp ratio takes the return that
11:03
we expect from the portfolio. Um, takes
11:05
away any risk-free rate. So, that's that
11:07
treasury bond 3%. Um, because that's
11:09
what we could get by having no risk at
11:12
all. And then it divides that return by
11:14
the standard deviation or in other
11:16
words, the risk of the portfolio in
11:18
order to figure out that ratio, right?
11:20
uh because obviously higher risk would
11:22
make that ratio lower, but lower risk
11:24
will make that ratio higher. So higher
11:25
ratio is better and that's what we're
11:27
looking for. And we can also use that to
11:29
compare against benchmarks like the S&P
11:30
500 to make sure we're meeting our
11:32
goals. And then with all of those, it
11:34
adds it all into one huge appendix um
11:37
where it has all this data between all
11:38
of these number of portfolios. And then
11:40
finally, it then finds the optimal
11:42
portfolios by putting them into array
11:44
and sorting them to find the top three
11:46
and then printing out or in other words
11:48
like outputting the top top three. So
11:49
that's what we find later on. And then
11:51
ne uh lastly for stage two, right? It
11:54
figures out the top portfolio and then
11:56
also figures out uh our benchmark
11:58
portfolio where in this case it's
12:00
imagining if we just put 100% into SPY.
12:02
And why is SPY used? uh because SPY is
12:05
used because it effectively represents
12:07
the S&P 500, but it's also better than
12:09
just using like the S&P 500 index
12:11
because of the fact that with SPY uh
12:13
being an ETF, it also uh uh takes into
12:16
account things like reinvested dividends
12:18
and stuff such like that. So, it's much
12:20
much more accurate of what an investor
12:21
might do. And that's why it's used as a
12:23
benchmark uh in place of S&P 500 rather
12:26
than just using something like the S&P
12:28
500 index.
12:30
And then it compares those two
12:32
portfolios
12:33
as well as adjusting for inflation and
12:35
the future values for each of those
12:36
portfolios so that we can compare those
12:39
um and then it prints out those
12:40
comparisons and that's what we will see
12:42
later on. So now we have our outputs and
12:46
as I mentioned before if we were to
12:47
click this again it'll randomize. It's
12:49
running those 50,000 simulations and
12:51
giving us what the best one out of those
12:52
80,000 simulations be. So from our uh
12:56
test here we can see 1.1815.
12:59
It's pretty good.
13:01
Uh, and we can see that there are three
13:03
different possible portfolios, but it's
13:05
ranking them as well. And seemingly
13:07
based on the 50,000 simulations it did,
13:09
this was the best one that it had.
13:12
And then so if we move on to stage two,
13:14
um, we can see that it's uh,
13:16
whatchamacall then has that same optimal
13:19
portfolio that we had as portfolio
13:20
number one. Um, and then now it's
13:22
comparing it to the S&P 500 benchmark.
13:24
So just taking a look at this, you can
13:26
see how it um had a bunch of different
13:28
asset correlations here or asset
13:30
allocations. So this is what it's
13:32
telling us that we should invest in
13:33
based on all of the risk and the
13:36
possible returns. And also this moves us
13:38
on to one of the checks that we can do
13:40
as a part of the validate stage. Uh
13:42
where if everything is correct here, it
13:46
should add up to a 100. So if we go
13:49
ahead and
13:51
uh type out all these values here and
13:53
then sum them
13:56
that's 100. So we know that it is at
13:58
least at the very least doing a random
14:01
sample or I guess a random random values
14:04
correctly by effectively whatchamacallis
14:09
it is giving a bunch of random values
14:12
correctly uh because they are all adding
14:13
up to 100%. So that's good on that
14:15
front. Uh we can also see that the
14:17
expected annual return is 23.11%
14:20
uh and the volatility is 17.02%.
14:23
The sharp ratio is 1.11815 and the real
14:26
return adjusted for inflation is 19.52%.
14:29
So looking at these values we can then
14:31
compare that to our benchmark which is
14:33
the S&P 500. Um, so as if we were to put
14:37
100% in SPY over that 10-year period, we
14:40
can see that in terms of the value that
14:42
it would have after 10 years, we're we
14:44
should expect to have 34,000 less if we
14:46
were to just do the S&P 500. Likewise,
14:49
with our expected ratio um after
14:51
inflation, we should have 6.52% higher
14:54
returns
14:56
and our sharp ratio is is also
14:58
significantly higher by nearly.3. So
15:00
that means in terms of our return to
15:02
risk, it is a much higher ratio. Uh that
15:05
being said though, our risk is a bit
15:07
higher but not by much. It's very close.
15:10
So with a similar amount of risk, we
15:11
should be able to get a higher ratio as
15:14
well. So we've met our goals in terms of
15:16
the results, right? We've got a higher
15:18
return rate. Um our risk is in a pretty
15:21
decent spot. I would say 20 25% would be
15:23
high good for me, but even then it's
15:25
lower than that. And our sharp ratio is
15:27
a lot higher, too. So that means in
15:29
terms of a return to risk um it's a
15:31
pretty good ratio of returns as opposed
15:34
to risk and we're also beating inflation
15:36
of course as well because we are well
15:38
above the S&P 500 and of course well
15:40
above that 3% inflation rate too.
15:44
Um so yep those are our outputs there
15:47
and uh we can also go ahead and validate
15:49
some of these things too right sharp
15:51
ratio uh one of the most important
15:53
things for it to calculate
15:55
uh we already know and we saw it earlier
15:57
but we already know that if we were to
15:59
take the real interest rate or not real
16:02
interest the expected interest rate or
16:04
the expected return rate apologize and
16:07
then take away 3%
16:10
and then we go ahead and divide it
16:15
by what our volatility is, which in this
16:17
case is 17.02,
16:20
we get 1.185
16:22
or in this case round to 16. But of
16:24
course, these numbers are larger than
16:26
two decimals. Uh but that's what it it
16:28
just automatically rounds to that. So
16:30
chances are um these values actually
16:32
cause it to be not uh what would round
16:36
to 1.8
16:37
1.1860
16:39
in this case. um it would round to it
16:42
would likely round to 1.1815.
16:45
So that's correct
16:48
there. So we know the sharp ratio is
16:49
calculating correctly. We can also go
16:51
ahead and test to see whether or not the
16:52
projected value is correct. Right? So we
16:54
take $10,000
16:56
um we go ahead and we take the expected
17:00
return which is in this case 1.2311
17:04
and we put it to the power of 10.
17:08
And we can see we're provided with
17:09
$79,971.
17:12
That is extremely close. It's off by
17:13
like $11. Why might that be? Once again,
17:16
rounding, right? This 23.11% isn't
17:19
actually going to be 23.11%. But because
17:21
we asked for it to output, it rounded to
17:23
a certain point. Um, but likely it's
17:25
actually a bit lower than that. Um, if
17:28
it's providing us with a slightly lower
17:29
amount, but that is only about $11. Um,
17:32
so we know that it's likely because of a
17:35
rounding error why it's giving us a
17:36
slightly different value. But this value
17:38
should definitely be correct. Right? And
17:41
so we know that it's calculating all of
17:42
these things correctly. And uh with that
17:46
that moves us on to semi valalidate
17:49
stage now right we've already validate
17:51
checked our calculations and there's
17:53
also the benchmark analysis in the code
17:54
and we made sure that it is doing what
17:56
we want it to do. It is beating the S&P
17:58
500 and it is indeed like diversifying
18:01
our portfolio between the investments
18:03
and everything like that. Right? Okay,
18:04
if we take a look uh here, right, we're
18:06
putting a lot into X SOM, a lot into SPY
18:09
as well, but then also giving like
18:11
different allocations as well between
18:12
the other ones. So, splitting up our
18:14
risk, but also putting a lot into those
18:16
that have high returns and as opposed to
18:18
their risks.
18:21
And then another thing that when talking
18:23
to the AI, what would be another way to
18:24
verify my data is what would happen if
18:27
we had a sensitivity analysis, right?
18:29
some uh something that can show whether
18:31
or not our code is robust or not is 1%
18:35
changes in like certain values. So if we
18:38
go ahead and let's say we change 3250 to
18:42
3150, we shouldn't see a humongous
18:44
change here, right? So of course our
18:47
ideal sharp ratio is going to change. It
18:50
lowers a bit here, but we can see it's
18:52
not hugely different, right? It it
18:54
lowered by like three or so uh on
18:57
average, right? and our uh projected
19:00
value uh actually in this case
19:03
increased. However, our risk also
19:05
increased by a bit as well. So, but
19:07
generally the values are pretty are very
19:09
similar, right? It's only about $3,000
19:11
off what we had prior, I believe. You
19:13
can see here. Yep. Only like two not
19:15
even 3,000, like $2,000 off what we had
19:17
before. Uh the weights are generally the
19:19
same. There's still a lot of X SOM. We
19:21
don't put as much into spy and stuff
19:22
like that. Um if we were to run it again
19:24
as well, it should be relatively
19:25
consistent. Yep. So sharp ratios are
19:28
still very similar. So changes in uh the
19:31
percents aren't giving huge swings which
19:34
means our um code is relatively robust
19:37
as well. And that finishes our verify
19:40
stage or validating stage. And so we can
19:43
move on to evolve and reflect right. So
19:47
uh with the evolve stage some possible
19:49
ways I was thinking about improving this
19:50
in the future. Right? Adding constraints
19:52
such as a max level of risk or minimum
19:53
amount of returns. Right? Right now,
19:55
we're just telling it, you know, find
19:56
the max ratio. But sometimes if we get
19:59
older, we might have a level of risk
20:00
that we actually want to maintain or go
20:04
under, right? Like whether it be 15% or
20:06
10% as we get older. So that would be
20:08
ways to improve this um method in the
20:10
future. Also some more complexity
20:12
because right now we're only using the
20:13
historical data from five years. We can
20:16
use more than that depending on what
20:18
wants we have or what needs we have. Um
20:21
likewise, if we try to compensate for
20:22
changes in the business cycle,
20:24
recessions, expansions, maybe try to
20:25
stress test it more and maybe try to
20:28
figure out like when we're um
20:31
like try to look at uh and take out any
20:35
like outliers in the data like certain
20:37
cases where maybe a stock went up by
20:39
like 300% at one point and then went
20:41
back down or something like that, right?
20:42
Trying to compensate for those things.
20:44
Also, we can also look for other ways to
20:46
measure risk aside from standard
20:47
deviation. there standard deviation is a
20:49
very common risk method but there are
20:51
other ones as mentioned in the session
20:53
assignment and then also uh even though
20:56
we haven't learned about them quite yet
20:58
and then also uh utilizing more stocks
21:00
and investments right diversification is
21:02
important uh and right now we don't have
21:04
a lot of options if we have more we can
21:06
get a potentially even better portfolio
21:09
or at least one that gets to benefit
21:11
more from diversification maybe we can
21:13
get the same amount of returns but lower
21:15
risk by a bunch more right and so that
21:17
can definitely um allow us to both
21:20
change our mix of risk and return and
21:22
also potentially get a better portfolio
21:23
as a whole. And then finally to uh to
21:27
reflect right what did we do? We managed
21:29
to calculate what a possible optimal
21:33
portfolio could be with the options
21:35
provided from us using real data and we
21:38
ultimately um we ultimately found that
21:41
this would be an ideal portfolio based
21:44
on our wants and find it maximizing our
21:46
sharp ratio right it has a much higher
21:48
sharp ratio than the S&P 500 it also
21:50
provides higher returns with not much
21:52
more risk only about 2% and should
21:55
provide humongous more much much huger
21:58
returns in comparison to what just the
22:00
S&P 500 or SPY could provide us within
22:03
10 years, right? By almost double
22:05
because of compounding.
22:08
And so I I I believe that we
22:09
successfully create an optimal
22:11
portfolio. Um also something that's
22:14
really interesting about
22:15
diversification, right? I keep on
22:16
talking about diversification, but it
22:18
really can benefit quite a lot, right?
22:20
we can we can really benefit it from it
22:22
like a ton because in some cases right
22:25
if we don't diversify then we are
22:27
putting ourselves really up there with
22:29
risk. Um but if we diversify we can keep
22:32
risk to a minimum. We can keep it to a
22:34
level that's comfortable with us but
22:35
then still maximize those returns. And
22:37
we can see that here with the fact that
22:39
our sharp ratio is so much higher which
22:40
means our return to risk is a lot
22:42
better. And also our volatility um is
22:45
very similar to what it was during SPY,
22:47
but our returns shoot up by a ton,
22:49
especially considering that these are
22:50
compounding returns. Um so that really
22:53
shows how important diversification can
22:55
be in spreading out our investments. Um
22:59
and then also another thing to think
23:00
about is can historical returns and
23:02
correlations predict the future? Um and
23:06
even though all of this seems nice and
23:07
fancy, realistically the answer is no.
23:10
Right? we've talked about a lot if
23:12
especially with the evolve, right? There
23:14
are changes in the business cycle that
23:16
occur. Um sometimes certain stocks and
23:18
stuff just go through their own internal
23:20
things, right? Companies will go through
23:21
their own internal issues and um and
23:25
sometimes that's just things that we
23:26
can't predict, right? These are pure
23:27
numbers and based on historical data, we
23:30
can get our best guess. So we can
23:34
attempt to predict the future but um I
23:39
guess predict wouldn't be the best but I
23:41
wouldn't agree with the word predict. We
23:42
can try to estimate the future but we
23:45
can't predict the future right it is
23:47
impossible to do that because historical
23:48
returns have already happened. We know
23:50
them for sure but in the future we don't
23:53
know what's going to happen. Other
23:54
factors can come in factors that aren't
23:56
necessarily numerical or even factors
23:59
that are numerical but might have
24:01
occurred due to other reasons that we
24:03
can't have possibly predicted due to
24:04
historical returns. So we can get an
24:06
estimate uh and an estimate of an ideal
24:08
portfolio but ultimately checking in
24:11
updating and I didn't put this in evolve
24:12
as well but something another thing that
24:14
could be important is updating the
24:16
portfolio from year to year right
24:18
keeping it active because things will
24:20
change between even just these four
24:23
stocks and these markets right and these
24:26
uh bond investments or like these ETFs
24:30
they can change um and it's only and if
24:34
we leave it for 10 years. Chances are a
24:36
few years from now, this is not going to
24:37
be the ideal portfolio even based on the
24:39
historical data that we have up until
24:40
that point. So, we can't predict the
24:42
future, but we can estimate. But
24:44
overall, um we did manage to
24:46
successfully find an optimal portfolio
24:48
based on historical data, and that is
24:50
what we have here,
24:52
right? And we compared it to the S&P 500
24:55
benchmark as well in order to see
24:56
whether or not we met our goals, which
24:58
we did. Thank you."
35990933,lbikkavi,Lahari,Bikkavilli,"Hi, how are you? This is Sorry, I might
have cut up. Hi, how are you? This is my
session six assignment. So, session six,
I believe. Yes. And so, I have two parts
here. I essentially have the code and
the output that the code is going to
give. But I also did take the time to
type up a bit more of a summary on the
lefth hand side here that we'll go over
after. For me personally, at least, I
think all the numbers and the way that
the output really comes out based off of
Gemini's Python coding was a little bit
confusing for me to honestly understand
at first. So now I've like taken a
little bit more time and I've made an
effort to you know summarize a little
bit more just so at least going
backwards I can understand what exactly
the code means. So we'll start by going
through the code then by briefly
reviewing their output and then going
through and giving a summary with where
I explain my understanding as well. So
starting off we have our basic import
statements. This is the stuff that you
have just to make the code work right.
So for example import pandas we've
definitely seen that in past homeworks
just everything to make the code
actually function. From there there's
going to be the driver stage one.
Another thing that I made a really big
note, there was two big things for this
homework was one to make sure that it
was definitely using driver and it was
specifically showing which parts it was
using what, right? So that way the code
is showing where exactly each section is
of driver. Second, I've been trying to
add a lot more comments just because
even when I'm going back through my
collab, it makes it easier for me to
understand the code better if I know
exactly what's occurring at each stage
of the code. So starting here, we have
our driver stage one, define and
discover, right? So we have whatever our
basic investment goal is. This is
maximize risk adjusted return using the
sharp ratio over a long horizon which in
this case is 25 plus years. Then we have
our risk tolerance which is going to be
high because it's a young investor. And
then we have the investment amount which
is our signing bonus of $10,000. Here
we're essentially writing all those
things down. So bonus dollars is going
to be our signing bonus. Risk-free is
going to be assumed to be 1%. So the
annual annual risk-free rate is going to
be 1%. Then we have our hypothetical
5-year historical data. So what data are
we going to use to kind of plan forward
and figure out where we're going from
here? We have it for all the different
companies. So we have Tesla, Apple,
Johnson and Johnson going forward. So
all our different numbers. Keep in mind
this is a benchmark. So it's not
investable in our set. Then we have the
given and assumed correlations. So we
have given correlations which we know
Tesla and Apple 0.65. We know Johnson
Johnson and then Tesla and Johnson
Johnson moving forward. Essentially all
the simple data that we got from the
textbook when we went through the
instructions, right? So you have all of
our given and assumed correlations. Then
we have stocks, right? Stocks is going
to be Tesla, Apple, Johnson, Johnson,
Exxon, excuse me. Stock bond correlation
is minus 0.2 so minus 2% right use for
all stock bond pairs documented
assumptions for missing pairs. So then
this is the assumed correlation again
this is what we're assuming from it
right so we have 0.35 0.3 and 0.2 too.
Moving on, there's a driver stage two,
which is represent. This is the
covariance matrix construction. So, our
universe or the ones that we're worried
about at least are all of our different
investors and people that we are looking
at. So, Tesla, Apple, Johnson, Johnson
like we went over. Then we have
different arrays that we're creating,
right? For A and universe and then for A
and universe here. Next, we have build
the full correlation matrix. So, this is
what's going to be represented by R.
Correlation is equal to PD.ATA frame NP
len universe. So you're setting the
index equal to universe and the columns
equal to universe. So we can actually
see here if we hover over one of these
it appeared. So we can see our universe
is what we set before which is Tesla,
Apple, Johnson, Johnson etc. And then
we're setting our index which is the
axis right this is mainly because um I
also took it upon myself for this one to
make some graphs which is why the code
looks a little bit different and was
harder for me to understand but I do
think that it has value in this
situation. So then we have for a b of c
given correlation times assumed and then
comma assumed correlation. So we have
that that we're doing here. We're doing
so you're filling in the given and
assumed correlations. Next you're
filling in your stock bond correlations.
So this is all information that we
listed above, correct? Just plugging it
in. Basically plugging and chugging.
Then you have the insured diagonal is
1.0. This is again for the line of the
graph. Makes to make sure that it's like
a neat line and that it connects even if
the points aren't exactly in a perfect
line. Then we have to calculate the
coariance matrix. So this is coariance
is equal to D * R* D. And then here down
here we see that D is the NP.log STDs.
And then um which is already here. So we
have a shape five and then we have
coariance our equation as well. Then we
have a few print statements again just
kind of understanding what the code is
doing at that point so you can
understand it a little bit better. And
then this is the optional part where
it's the positive semi uh def definitive
which is PSD check. So going through
you're checking different things you're
printing. So warning the coariances
coariance not PSD under assumed
correlations. So the results are
inaccurate here or that it is PSDs the
analysis can proceed just so when you're
looking at the different graphs or
different um uh data displays that I
have you can tell whether it's something
that you can trust it's accurate or it
could be inaccurate. Then visual one,
this is where we start going. The first
thing the v first visual I chose was a
heat map, right? So the heat map, this
is all essentially to make the heat map.
Correlation heat map divers
diversification potential is going to be
the title and then we have our um access
on the right. So it' be the y-axis which
is the correlation coefficient which
will all make sense when I show the
actual graph a little bit later on. Then
we have our helpers. This is the
reusable portfolio math functions. So
the sharp ratio which we've already went
over where you have meu which is a float
you have your standard deviation is a
float and you have your risk-free which
is also a float and this calculates the
sharp ratio which is the return minus
the risk-f free divided by that
volatility and it's going to return
whatever that number is. Next we have
the port status um stats sorry excuse me
and then so again same thing calculates
return standard deviation and sharp
ratio for a given weight array. Then we
have um the clip's weight to 01 and
renormalizes to sum to one. essentially
different things for different
calculations just so we can show all of
this I'll be explaining a little bit
more in depth just wanted to walk
through the code at first then we have
implement for the driver stage which is
the core analysis right first thing is
Tesla and bond sweep so the free lunch
of diversification right here we have
our um grid and then we have the Tesla
index the bond index equals universe
index universe index and then we have
the bond stats so essentially making
sure that we're checking the Tesla
versus Tesla and then the bond versus
the bond then here Tesla in the grids
then you have NP0 zeros. So one minus
Tesla and then Tesla bondstats.pen. So
you're appending to this full list to
kind of see what the bond stats are for
that. Then um keep going here and we
have um more about the diversification.
We have the data frame here which is
going to essentially tell you what the
columns are going to be for this row
with for this um display and essentially
printing. So Tesla bond two asset sweep
analysis free lunch then the max sharp
which is the best risk adjusted return.
You can kind of see a little bit more of
kind of what the graph might look like
down there for certain things. And then
um the weights as well. Moving on for
visual two is a Tesla bond efficient
set. So again, these are scatter plots
and um different plots that I made which
we'll be gone through in a little bit
more depth. Then the Monte Carlo
frontier, the visualization of the full
MPT space. So we have N, which is the
number of random portfolios which we're
setting 20,000 at this point. Then we
have um other important numbers here.
like normalizing the weight and things
just to work and make sure we can do
that Monte Carlo frontier part of this.
And then moving forward different things
we have the sharp which is minus the
risk-f free rate minus the standard
deviation all those different
calculations we have the frontier again
and then we have the different things
that we have to like return standard
deviation sharp what they are and what
we're setting them to be then moving on
optimization setup um nothing that I
think I'm not going to cover here later
so I might skim through some of this a
little bit just for time and then max
optimization so um same thing you're
setting the balance equal to balance the
constraints equal to constraints and
then the method that we're going to use
And that's kind of the same thing that
we're doing here for the min variance
optimization as well. So looking through
we have mu we have our different like
different um uh right here we have the
res um res min variance as well. And
then here we have our output
optimization results. So um this is
what's going to be we're using the spy
and the r and then spy versus the
standard deviation. Optimization results
are going to show the benchmark then
what the standard deviation is what the
then what the sharp is. Then it's going
to show the max sharp the r the standard
deviation and sharp as well. Then the
min variance. So exactly whatever we
calculated is exactly what's being
inputed here and those are numbers that
we'll go through in a little bit more
depth. After that we have validate for
drivers stage number four. So
essentially the question is can we beat
spies return with less than or equal to
spy risk right? So that's what we're
kind of testing here. So validation beat
spy with less risk question mark and
then feasible you're trying to figure
out whether it's feasible or if it's not
feasible. So if feasible exists so if
this is possible you're saying that idx
is equal to frontier um location. So
mask sharp and then you're saying print
feasible candidate best sharp among
those else you're doing the take the
closest trade-off minimize shortfall and
excess risk. So the often masked sharp
essentially figuring out whether this
the entire section is to figure out
whether this is possible. So whether can
we beat this having less than that risk
or is it not possible and so we do that
there. Then coming down here again more
print statements. So figuring out the
selected candidate versus the spy target
um printing out our different standard
deviations or sharps um and all the
different numbers that we have there.
Then moving forward, we have again here
we have our $10,000 allocation from the
signing bonus earlier. Chosen portfolio
weights that we have. And then the
visual three again another plot will
make more sense when I'm actually
looking at the diagram there a little
bit. And then the summary this is where
we're kind of concluding what it is and
what there is about the code in general.
So we have the portfolio. So the spy
return sharp standard deviation all
pretty much using the same mentality and
the same um layout here. Maxsharp return
standard deviation sharp min variance
return standard deviation sharp as well.
and then chosen versus by um goal. Then
we're assigning those values to
different things and we're rounding it
to two two decimal places just to make
it a little bit easier. Then we have our
summary which we're finally going to
print which is going to return the
percent of these different things. It's
essentially going to return the numbers
for all these different things with the
summary itself. We have model parts
which is evolve essentially right so
like age based recommendation
sensitivity. So what happens like as
time changes is what we're looking at.
And so we have the aggressive um the
aggressive uh range that you can do
which is recommended for the age and
then there's the balance and then more
conservative. So pre-retirement versus
midlife and the reason aggressive says
recommended for age is because remember
we already said that they were high risk
because they were young investors. So
because they're young they c they are
able to afford being a little bit more
aggressive at this time because they
don't have as much to lose upfront. Then
here we have evolved model portfolios
with risk profile um putting the names
uh again printing the allocation and
then finally we're we're reflecting
here. The reflecting here is not as
in-depth as I'm going to go, but
essentially reflecting you have your
free lunch, the negative stock bond
correlation, and then bent the Tesla
bond set inward reducing volatility
without much return loss. Then two for
optimal allocation, you're going to do
max sharp portfolio sharp and then
limitations is going to essentially go
through what the limitations are. Right,
moving forward here. So the first
numbers that we have are um I'm going to
go ahead and make this a little bit
bigger so that we can go through the
next section. So the first thing we have
is the correlation matrix
representative, right? So starting from
the beginning, I'm going to kind of go
through my own and then we can walk
through this after. So I started with
figuring out what the define and
represent is. So in this, what is the
original goal? The goal is that we
maximize the sharp ratio with that
$10,000 signing bonus and long-term
horizon of 25 plus years. So we saw that
in the code earlier as well. The risk
tolerance is high. Again, we know this
because it's a young um because it's a
young investor. And then we built a
correlation matrix between Tesla, Apple,
J&J, and continuously. And here's what
we found. We found that there was a high
correlation between Tesla and Apple 0.65
65 because they move similarly, right?
They have similar growth within their
businesses and within their company. And
that's going to be the numbers right
here, right? So, we're seeing 0.65 here
as well. Then we're going to see um that
there's negative correlations as well.
So Tesla and their bond for example,
right? We're going to see there's
negative 0.2 here, right?
Diversification benefit. So we're going
to see it's a little bit more of a
negative correlation compared to Tesla
and Apples positive um positive
correlation due to their similar
movement. Then we have our heat map.
This is the heat map. So to kind of
explain it a little bit further, I'm
unsure if I'm able to put the entire
thing, but on the bottom we can see that
our bounds here on the bottom and on the
left side are going to be the different
things we have. So Tesla, Apple, all
those different things. And then on the
right, we're going to have our
correlation coefficient. So the heat
map, the way it essentially works is I
have something down here. This heat map
shows how each asset moves relative to
the others. So darker colors, which are
closer to one. So right here on our
right is where you would see the key. So
this dark purple would be um dark purple
would be like like the darkest color
would be the lowest and then we have the
1.0 which is a little bit lighter,
right? So um means assets move together
like Tesla and Apple. So for example, if
I was going to pull Tesla from here and
move down to find Apple, I'd be able to
find them here. So again, more on the
higher up. There is a lot of correlation
between them because the companies do
move closer, right? So that would make
sense. They're kind of landing around
that um around that yellowish green mark
which is around 0.6 0.8 which is
representative of the 0.6 65 we saw
earlier and so um which is again like
Tesla and Apple then lighter colors
sorry this is a little bit backwards I
wrote it because I changed the colors
after but um they show low negative
correlation such as the Tesla bond which
is going to be minus 2.0 and that's
going to be more down here in this area
so Tesla and Johnson Johnson it
essentially proves the diversification
potential so that assets move
differently um that assets that move
differently reduce total portfolio risk
so that's essentially what I was trying
to prove with this diagram in general
and I think that is what it proves. So
we have our title here which is that
coariance matrix is PSD and kind of
moving through and trying to understand
what that means as a whole. So again
this is our correlation matrix just
printing out what the actual values are
here for each of them. Essentially
whatever this is showing is exactly what
the heat map is showing but with a
little bit more of a display feature
there. Then moving on the second graph
is a Tesla bond um two asset curves.
That's this graph right here. So you see
this is the straight line that we have
which goes through curved at the
beginning and then this is our um key in
the top right for it here. Here I can
think I can make it on the full page.
There we go. So um the graph plots the
risk x axis versus return y axis. So our
risk is going to be down here where my
cursor is and then the y is going to be
right here which is expected return for
portfolios combining Tesla and bonds in
different weights. The curve bends
inwards. So as you can see it's going to
be here and it's going to bend inwards
that way as opposed to bending outwards
this way. And um it shows that the risk
reduction effect from negative
correlation. So we already talked about
how they already had a negative.2
correlation. Correct. So that's what
kind of what that inward that inward um
inward curve is essentially for the
graph and what that really means and so
um shows the risk reduction effect from
negative correlation. The red star is
the max sharp index max sharp mix sorry.
So we can see the red star is right here
around 0.05 for the expected return. And
so um it shows where return stays high
but volatility drops sharply which we
can tell because that's where the curve
stops and it starts getting towards more
of a straight line. It visually
demonstrates the free lunch of
diversification, lower risk without
losing much return. So that was
essentially this graph. For me at least,
I thought it was a little bit easier to
understand this Tesla bond uh curve if I
was able to actually visually see it. So
I tried to have um Gemini at least
create some sort of displays or data
validations that I can use. So I can
actually physically see the data here.
And then this is the optimization
results which I will come back to. But
kind of going back down just to like the
last graph while we're here. This is the
third graph which is the efficient
frontier and key portfolios. This is the
Monte Carlo simulation. So it's a
scatter plot. It displays 20,000
simulated portfolios across all five
assets. So you can imagine that each of
these dots is essentially a different
portfolio. Obviously there's so many of
them. So it combines into sort of a
streak. Then it says each dot one
portfolio colored by sharp ratio. Green
equals better. So the higher you get up,
the better your ratio is compared to
lower. So we can see at the top here
we're seeing like the most dark green
right around here around the 0.1 between
0.05 and 0.1. But as you go up way
higher, you get really lighter colors,
especially by the 0.3. And so the upper
boundary is the efficient frontier
representing the best portfolio for each
risk rate. The blue X, so that's going
to be right here in the middle here is
the S&P 500 best benchmark, which is our
benchmark for when exactly what we
started with, right around here, again
between 0.10 and 0.15. And then we have
the um what the red star, which is the
max sharp portfolio. So red star is the
max sharp. So the max again, the greener
you are, the better, right? So right
around here, right as you start the
graph, is where you're going to have
your max. And then the purple dot is the
min variance portfolio. So min is right
here. It's even lower because there was
essentially nothing there is what it was
trying to prove. So um those are that
and that's the min variance portfolio.
The max sharp point lies above spy. So
we can see that the max sharp like
relies above this spy which means that
because if you move this up you can see
that it lies above and um means it
provide providing the optimized
portfolio delivers higher return for
equal or less risk. So essentially what
it's trying to say is at this point like
for you're going to get the same amount
of return for whether you have an equal
or less risk which is essentially what
we were trying to prove with question
two right the original question up here.
So um I'm not sure if I have it written
here but I do know that we have it
written here where the question is
essentially
uh can we be spy return with spy risk
and that's kind of what the graph is
showing a little bit moving forward to
kind of continue through this here. So
this is again a little bit more of just
like the data we have right so result
you're adding 20 to 30% bonds sharply
which lowered risk while keeping strong
returns the curve bends inwards right
like we saw on the graph it proves that
combining uncorrelated assets reduces
volatility without losing much return so
Tesla is only 35% return 60% risk and if
you mix them you have 30% return 48 risk
so much higher than the sharp ratio then
the mic Carlo optimization which was
question two simulates the 20,000 random
portfolios that we went over the dots is
the random portfolios this is
essentially a key again but we see spy
for R is equal to 12% the STD is 18% and
sharp is approximately 0.61 then the max
sharp portfolio 1820 18-20% so again
higher than the spy standard deviation
again lower than the spy here so we have
our STD is 18% here it's 15 to 17 and
then we have 0.9 is 1.0 so again higher
for the sharp ratio than the spy so our
min variance is going to be 7.8 lower
and standard deviation is also going to
be lower validation. So if tested, let
me go through and see what parts of this
I may have skipped. Okay, so validation.
So tested if any mixed beats spy 12%
return with less than or equal to 18%
risk found near fausible feasible
options. So chosen portfolio had
approximately 16 to 18% return with 15
to 17% risk. So the allocation example
on 10k is 2.8k 8K for Apple, 3K for
Tesla, 2K for the bonds and etc. Then
here we have the evolve section, right,
which is right here. We can kind of go
through it. Essentially, all the numbers
that I just read are correlated to this
section right here, which is essentially
giving a summary for each of these, the
spy and then for the max sharp, min
variance, and then the chosen versus spy
goal, right? So essentially a summary of
what you're seeing in the graph. So each
of these different things here, for
example, also you're going to see a
summary of what's going on in the graph
above it. So B SPY with less risk, Q2,
it is feasible, which is what we just
read. it's a feasible candidate as well.
And then it shows the differences in the
numbers. It shows the differences in the
weights. So Tesla's 9.9, Apple 20.8, J&J
32.7, and kind of going forward there a
little bit with that. And so then we
have our Max Sharp again, all numbers
that we read on the right left side.
Just wanted to show that they're the
same, but on the left was kind of more
me understanding the data a little bit
better. So I could was able to explain
it in a way. And so evolve, we have our
model portfolios by risk profile. So
there's three different types of
evolves, which we have listed here. a
little bit more spe uh specifically. So
we have aggressive, right? Aggressive is
recommended for their age. So because
they're young, like we talked about
Ford, this is what's recommended. More
Tesla and Apple, less bond because it's
a higher risk/ return. So here again,
you're going to see the numbers that
kind of prove this, right? So 14.68.
You're going to see the numbers, and the
numbers essentially reflect the fact
that aggressive is a good um it's a good
option or a good choice in this case
because of the young age that they have.
Next, you're going to have um balanced.
balance is a very mid-level growth if
you're looking for something very stable
kind of keeping as consistent as you are
not changing too much. So midlife again
using same numbers it's going to show
what the return is the standard
deviation and the sharp ratio alongside
that and then it's going to show and so
then we have conservative which is more
bond lower risk steady income. So
conservative is like you're trying to
keep as much as you want. You're worried
you don't have that much money to put up
front or you just want to keep whatever
your business is at the way it is. So
that would be keep it the way it is.
increased bonds. So you have a steady
income coming in but you're going to
have a lower risk as well. Then we have
a reflect, right? So what does this
mean? Key takeaways. So free launch is a
negative stock bond correlation of
minus0.2 bent the Tesla bond set inward
which is the inward curve we saw. This
reduced volatility without much return
loss. Then we have optimal allocation.
The max sharp portfolio sharp 1.15
versus spy sharp 0.61. The optimizer
improved risk adjusted returns via
diversification not stock pricing. So
essentially it says that diversification
works. Negative correlations reduced
risk which is the free lunch.
Optimization helps the mix sharp mix
outperformed spy on a riskadjusted bas
basis. So optimization does help in this
case. And finally what the limits are to
this market. So limitations you're going
to say inputs are hypothetical and
static. Again remember we assumed
earlier at the beginning this may or may
not be accurate. In stress correlations
can jump towards the plus one. Shrinking
diversification rebalancing helps keep
risk on target. So real markets change
correlation risk during crashes. So
rebalancing is key. Again, our
simulation and our data that we put was
considering the market is fairly stable,
which is not the case in day-to-day. The
market is going to have changes that's
going to cause these numbers to also
fluctuate. So it's something that's
important to remember. Overall, I think
the best portfolio for a young long-term
investor like we were looking at was the
aggressive mix. So it emphasizes growing
stock with moderate bond exposure. And
the main takeaway is that you don't need
to predict the market. You don't you
just need to build a balanced mix of
assets that move differently. So this
kind of helps take away from some of the
limits we have here where you have the
real market chains. You don't need to
predict the market. You can just stay
the way you are and build a balanced mix
of those assets and then you can regular
your rebalancing ensures this advantage
stays intact over time. Um then I have a
little bit more about the graphs that I
read prior. But essentially this is my
conclusion overall. So we see that if
you are a very young or new long-term
investor, the aggressive mix is what's
going to work for you because you don't
have to worry about changes in the
market as heavily and you can also build
that balance of mix assets and move in a
certain way. that way you can stay
sustainable in the market. And I think
that pretty much wraps up the my session
six assignment. These are the three
graphs I approved. Again, not entirely
sure if they're exactly correct, but
they were at least a really good asset
for me to be able to visualize and
understand the information more. And I
think I definitely got a better grasp on
it. So thank you.

"
36050644,jdragoni,Joe,Dragoni,"All right. Hello. I'm Joe Dragoni and this is my session six assignment doing the portfolio risk and return analysis today. So, uh going through this assignment, um our mission today is that we have our first job. We want to invest $10,000 sign or $10,000 signing bonus. Uh our colleague suggests uh going all in on Tesla because it's the future, but our parents say stick with an S&P 500 index fund, but we want to build our build our own portfolio here. So available investments uh with 5-year hypo hypothetical historical data. We have Tesla, Apple, Johnson, Johnson, Exon Mobile, Vanguard Bond, and the S&P 500 fund. So you can see the average returns here the first percentage points 35 22 9 8 3 and 12 respectively then the standard deviation being 60 28 15 25 4 and 18 respectively um and then some correlations to consider uh Tesla and Apple correlation is 65 Johnson and Exxon Mobile is.3 Tesla and Johnson and Johnson is.1 and stocks and bonds negative.2 2. So being the S&P and Vanguard. So going to our first stage in the driver framework, our define and discover stage. Um our investment goal here is to build a portfolio to maximize long-term earnings and capital. Um we want to minimize risk, beat inflation to get a real return. Um went over the details already there. Um and then we're going to go over a 10-year analysis or investing and seeing the returns and the risk for 10 years. Um some of the metrics to look at the the annual return the average return sharp ratio which is the return on investment uh if the return on the the return on the investment is worth the risk taken um a high ratio for that is better um than the volatility and the volatility being similar to risk. The correlations between all the stocks we'll see that in a correlation matrix in a second. And then just the risk return ratios and then some other things to be concerned about or to think about in terms of risk. um the balance between volatility and growth. Um not being too conservative because obviously we want to we want to earn more over the course of our 10 years investing but we also don't want to be too risky because we don't want to lose our money. Um, and then other events like recession, a pandemic, or an e economic shutdown could play a role here as like like we've had the past 5 years says we just looked at five year historical data. Um, and those were um sprinkled with COVID, government shutdowns, recessions, all of that. And that definitely played a role in the stock market. And then we want to make a plan, not divert from it. Um, do anything behavioral behavioral to affect our risk or our returns. So for the represent stage um creating some visualizations for risk, return, volatility, correlations here. So some other things to consider a higher return is better because we obviously want to earn more money. Um so we won't say no to a lower return or won't say no to a higher return rather we will say no to a lower return and the higher standard deviation is more volatility and risk. Um and we want to balance these things out to get our highest return um but not be too conservative like we said already. So just going through some of the code here, we'd find our assets and our benchmark, the Tesla, Apple, Johnson, Johnson, Exommobile, the Vanguard Bond, and our S&P 500. We got some of our asset data here and our benchmark data. Um, and then we combine all of that in an array to make it easier to look at all the returns and all the standard deviations to plot. Um going through here, create a matrix, the correlations, stock bond correlations here in this line of code. Um some assumptions for missing data, some of the correlations that we weren't given. Um and then yeah, a heat map for our correlations, which I'll show in a second. Um bar chart for the volatility and risk, the the risk bar chart here, um which you'll see in a second. the average return bar chart. Um, so all of these using Python pandas to make these. Um, and then simulating returns over 10-year period. Um, as you can see here with our starting investment of $10,000 to create another plot that you'll see in a second. And then our our next step, step five, is visualizing the risk return tradeoff using the efficient frontier curve, which we do here. Um we have all these a lot of portfolios um just so we can see the curve um the risk-free rate being 2%. Um and then our correlation matrix plays a role in that as well. And then all this code even though I'm still pretty new with Python so I don't know exactly what it does but we can run this code real quick. I know I went through that a little bit fast, but all it does here is just create our correlation matrix, which we can see here between um the five stocks, not including our benchmark, which you'll see we'll make another one with the benchmark in a second, but just with the five stocks and the bond, we can see that the highest correlation is with Tesla and Apple being 65, ignoring the diagonal because that's just all of the stocks going against each other. So apple to apple correlation obviously will be one um because it's the same and then the rest of them are pretty in the middle positive and then we get some negatives here um the stocks with the bond are negative because when stocks go down bonds go up. Um then we also have the annual volatility and risk. Um Tesla has the highest risk. So our colleague suggesting have putting it all on Tesla would be very risky as we can see here with the standardization or the standard deviation rather being the highest for this one and then bonds are the safest here as they have the lowest standard deviation. Then our highest annual return uh Tesla also has the highest average return annually. So with risk comes return and vice versa as we can see here bonds with the lowest return they also have the lowest risk. So it's the safest but you won't earn as much. So that's just being conservative. And then the growth over 10 years plotted in this curve here, this line plot with all three of the uh or all of the investment choices we had. So it shows Tesla has the highest growth, but as we can see here, it goes up and down, which just highlights the risk that we'll face. And then Exon Mobile grows as well, but also drops at the end. So it's a little bit risky. As you can see here, it was the third most risky with Apple being the second. Um, and that's in the orange here, but it doesn't grow as much. And then the S&P 500 also grows, but declines over around year six. Um, and then the one that grows the least is the bonds. It just grows at a constant rate. Um, and Johnson and Johnson, the green one here, as you can see, if I can I'll scroll down a little so you can see this better, does not grow as much as the rest. And then here's our our first efficient frontier curve showing um going all in in Tesla. And just put the all-in in Tesla and the individual asset for Tesla is up here at the very top highlighting the greatest risk and greatest return here. And the bond showing the least amount of risk and least return here. And then this star is our max sharp ratio performance between just the five not including um just not including portfolios being a mix of all of them. It's just like individual here. So our max ratio sharp ratio performer would be down here where this red star is um which shows not a lot of return but not a lot of risk. So now going down to the implementation stage to actually calculate some portfolios here. So I used uh Y finance daytime map plot lib as well as well as numpy pandas and seabor here. Um so going looking through here we're actually acquiring validating our data in this first step as we did in the example in class. Um and then here in stage two is where we calculate our annual returns for all of the stocks. and including that concludes the correlation matrix again this time with the S&P 500 um and we show that as a heat map again which you'll see in a second um and then here that was stage three actually was the risk analysis and then this was the annual returns um calculating all of the annual returns here and then we go down to stage four on to test a bunch of portfolio combinations which we'll put in another inflation frontier curve here in a second but we have all these assets here. Um, and then we do what we called the or Google Gemini helped calculate a Monte Carlo simulation, which I learned was using a lot of random experiments to just gather a whole bunch of data. So, as you can see here, we have 30,000 portfolios and we're calculating a whole bunch to really see which one the best is. Um so running down here it calculates the Monte Carlo simulation showing and helps to find the most return the best sharp ratio the weights for that which how much of each stock we invested per that portfolio and then show the volatility as well. And then um some more custom portfolios that we made which included the benchmark um the growth the growth focused equal weights um being 20% for each growth focused 80% the tech which would be um more in Tesla and Apple and then conservative um putting more into the bonds and some of the less riskier stocks as well and less into Tesla and Apple. So doing all this putting some uh putting that all together in another for loop to calculate the return the risk and the sharp ratio. Um so we can compare that as well. And then our last our next stage stage five is where we identify the best portfolio and compare. So we find that we use this line of code to find the max sharp ratio which would be the highest return um per the risk and then the safest the min um volatility portfolio calculating the one with the lowest risk. Um and then with the one that we found for the max sharp ratio, it'll show us the return, the volatility, the sharp ratio, and the weights of each stock that we invested in here. Um and then same with that minimum volatility. And then this just calculates all of the uh visualizations or more visualizations updated ones including the efficient frontier curve. Um and then as as well as plotting the custom portfolios, the techsavvy one, the um conservative and the equal weights as well. And then down here the also the all-in on the S&P 500 the benchmark and all in on Tesla which is another thing that we wanted to consider per the description of this problem. So running this it'll go through takes a little bit to run it although I ran it already so I know it works. Go up to the top here. Um this is just this code right here is showing Apple the Bond Johnson S&P 500 Tesla and Exxon Mobile for the last 5 days of 2025. So it's actually the real time data um showing the actual results and what the prices were at the given moment that I ran this code. So 262 for Apple, $74 for the certain Vanguard bond that we picked. um the S&P 500 being at 671, so on and so forth. And then the average annual returns calculated above in the code for each one. Apple being 21%, Tesla 41%. That's so that one would be the highest return, but like we said, we did the same thing with the risk as well down here. And it's Tesla has the highest risk as well. Um and the bond has the lowest return with the lowest risk. So another way to to visualize um the causality between the risk and the return here and then you can also see the other returns in the percentage points. Um and then we've corrected another correlation matrix this time including the S&P 500 data. So again showing that here all the bonds put against each other are have a correlation of one. Um and the highest correlation stocks being the S&P 500 and Apple. Um showing that as like the S&P 500 goes up. Apple I guess being in there also goes up. And then Tesla and Apple have a moderate positive relationship. The S&P 500 and Tesla also have a pretty posit moderate positive relationship. But again, putting the bonds, correlating those with the rest of the stocks, we can see it's very low. It is a little positive. It's not negative this time, except for with Exxon Mobile, showing that when the bonds go up, the Exon Mobile is likely going down. And same with Tesla and Johnson and Johnson, which is another interesting thing to look at here. Going down to the rest of the results from the implement stage. Um so looking at the return volatility and the sharp ratio for the uh equal weight portfolio here we can see the weights are all equal. We put 20% of our 10,000 in each of these. Um so it would be $2,000 um in each of these bonds. It doesn't have a very high sharp ratio. It's it's still good. Um being in the one range is pretty good. Um it's not risky. So it shows that when we diversify our portfolio, we are we have less risk and a higher return here. And then when we put more of our bonds in Tesla and Apple, which have more risk, it shows that our volatility here is less than our return. And then our sharp ratio is not as good. So this might not be the best option to pick. And then same thing here, this the 75% value um in bonds. So putting more of our money in bonds and then Exommobile and Johnson Johnson, the stocks with the less risk gives us higher return than it does risk but still lower numbers for the return um than the equal weight and growth focused portfolios that we looked at as well. So it does have a good sharp ratio or at least better than the um equal weight ratio but only by 0.07 points. So still maybe not the best or most ideal or optimal portfolio to invest in. Now the one with our best sharp ratio that we found at least in this example from what Google Gemini's code has showed me was um the optimal weights here. As you can see here putting most of our money in Exon Mobile um only a little bit in the bonds and a little bit in Apple and Tesla gives us a return of 25.24%. 24% uh lower risk 18.58% and then a sharp ratio of 1.25 which is still in the good realm. It's not nothing spectacular per my research but this would be our max sharp ratio portfolio that the code has calculated here through the Monte Carlo experiment. And then the one with the least amount of volatility um here shows the volatility of 6.26% 26% but trying to be safer and going for the lowest risk gives us less of a return. So that's just the trade-off we have to think about. And the sharp ratio here is also not great. So even though we're trying to be safe here, it still will not return us the best amounts. And then the next thing another um efficient frontier curve shows us here the max sharp ratio portfolio has a risk of about 0.2 here and a return of 0.25. So it would be right here in this realm and it is on the outside of the curve and not in the inside. Um because as you go down the curve inside of the curve it just shows that there are better opportunities as you go out. Um then as you can see up here this gray X all in Tesla the greatest amount of volatility but also the greatest return. Um, and then the growth focused here in this uh this teal rhombus. Um, the minimum volatility portfolio all the way down to the bottom here. As you can see, very low on the return and the risk and so on and so forth. You can pause the video to look at analyze this a little bit more. I can show that. Um, but this is the next efficient frontier curve to really analyze all the different portfolios that we came up with. And then now going down to the validation stage. Um what I did to um validate the portfolio is I put all of the I put the what we calculated up here against the benchmark putting all of our money in the S&P. Um as you can see here, that's what we did here. And then another benchmark to look at was a 6040 um portfolio where we put 60% in the S&P 500 and 40% in bonds. Um and then did the consolidation of all of our data here to return what portfolio it was the return it gave us the risk or volat volatility and the sharp ratio as well and then had to format a table here so we could see the code. So if I run this for the validation stage um we can see this has rankings for the it ranks by the sharp ratio. So we can see the highest sharp ratio was the max sharp ratio portfolio that we calculated here. Then followed up by the conservative portfolio um putting all of our money in Exon Mobile. And then the um one with the worst sharp ratio which is negative um was putting all of our money in bonds which gives us very little return but still a little bit risky. So we what we wouldn't want to do is put all of our money in bonds here. Um, and then what our co colleague said about going all in on Tesla, we get the highest return from doing that at 41.77%. But it is also by far the riskiest investment as it is about 30 almost 30 more than the growth focused. Um, putting most of our money in Tesla and Apple. Um, yeah, the risk is 60 61.34% there. So, this is how I validated my answers. And then going down to the evolve stage, evolving what we learned beyond what we learned already. Um some of sorry yeah some of how changing the mix affects the risk and return here. Um we could we already saw a little bit of how the different combinations affected risk and return. Um, putting all of our money in risky stocks like Tesla and Apple gives us a higher return for sure, but the risk is something we would want to look at. Um, and then some other applications we can evolve this to include adding other assets to the growth focused portfolio um, which likely decrease more decrease risk more than decreased return. Um, because as we diversify our portfolio um, it becomes less risky. there's less of a worry of putting all of our money in one stock and then that one stock dropping and losing all of our money. Um, and then diversification, like we already said, that's very critical. Um, all of our stocks had the all- in on stocks had the highest risk even though having some of the highest return numbers and the efficient frontier curve showing the trade-offs between risk and reward with um the like we showed above as you go out on the curve it gets um more optimal for our return. So that's another a great um visualization to look at. Um, so looking at what the correlations between stocks meant and how that was powerful when diversifying, we saw the bonds having a negative correlation to stocks, meaning that when stocks went down, the bonds tended to go up. And the S&P 500 um is already diversified across 500 stocks as a lot of people know. So that has decent low risk. Um, but when that goes up, it shows um that all stocks are moving together. um which shows that all the ones within the S&P S&P 500 have a high correlation. And some other things that we could consider might be um it not being the best idea to have historical data from the previous 5 years because as we know COVID happened back in 2020, we've had a recession, some shutdowns. So that might not happen in the future or it might happen even worse in the future. So using historical data might not be the best um for calculating return returns but might be better for calculating risk. Um there could be some other new stocks companies that could grow and cause some of the other companies to to become obsolete like maybe Tesla maybe electrification for cars might become obsolete and hydrogen power become something. Uh so maybe the first brand to absolutely nail on the head hydrogen power might become the next big stock in Tesla Tesla stock might plummet. uh you never know. Then some other risk measures that I helped or learned some more about through Google Gemini um included the Sortino ratio um which was a modification of the sharp ratio that only penalizes downside volatility. Value at risk um being the 95 95th percentile of losses um showing what we can expect to lose in a day or a month or any other certain time period uh fix maybe like a week, maybe a year. um we can calculate with the value at risk and then the conditional value at risk would be the average loss on a bad day like it would answer the question if we're having a terrible day what could we expect to lose on that day and then last but not least moving down to the reflection stage um some surprises and some things to take away from this that I got um I learned it really nodded on the head that diversification can reduce risk below individual asset risks. So, when you diversify all your money across a bunch of assets, it is a lot less risky than putting all your money in one stock. Um, because like you said, if like we said already, if we invest all our money in Tesla, if Tesla was to plummet, then we would lose all of our money. But if we have a bunch of money in a lot of different things, then we don't have to worry about that. Um, high return assets gen generally require accepting higher risk and portfolio optimization finds the best risk return combination. So, we were able to do that with Google Gemini, and that was a very useful tool to have, but I'm sure there are some more accurate ones out there, but just using Gemini was a good way to begin there. Some surprises that I found um included that the importance of risk and return balance. Um so, yeah, in order in order to have a higher return, you must consider higher risk and if that's something worth doing. Um but definitely to diversify your portfolio there. And going on on top of diversification again, all the benefits it has, including more return for less risk, the sharp ratio. When you um diversify your portfolio, it'll likely increase your sharp ratio. And we saw there not one thing has a causal relationship on every stock. Um the max sharp ratio portfolio might be a bit conservative even though one may think it might be more diverse or taking more risk. Um, and then another just important general concept in investing in the stock market is that there's not one size that fits all and there isn't a right answer for everyone. Um, and there might be a different risk tolerance between a young tolerance between a young investor and a retiree. Maybe the retiree wants less risk and just wants like steady income since they're not working. But the young investor getting more money might want to be ambitious and grow, take a risk because they still have all this time to turn their life around. say if they lose all their money in betting all on Tesla and then um so past performance is not indicative of future results uh returns are not stable correlations are susceptible to change and the world is also changing um there's not always pandemics recessions economic shutdowns and there are always new companies growing or old companies you know losing money becoming obsolete as we already talked about so we can't just rely on the same stocks um or or just past performance of the same stocks over and over again. And then just from that, like we talked about already with that historical data, it might be better for modeling future risk um rather than modeling future returns because things are always changing. So that was my session six assignment. Thank you for watching."
37519354,dave59,Vihaan,Dave,"Okay, so this is my session session six
assignment, portfolio risk and return
analysis. So my mission here is that
I've just started my first job and I
want to invest my $10,000 signing bonus.
Uh one of my colleagues suggest going
all in on Tesla because it's the future
while my parents are saying that I
should stick to the S&P 500 index fund
and I want to build my own portfolio.
These are the available investments with
fiveyear histo hypothetical historical
data.
And so as we can see here Tesla the
average the average return it's 35%
while the standard deviation is 60%. For
Apple it's 2228.
Johnson and Johnson it's 9 and 15. Exon
Mobile it's 8 then 25. Vanguard bond ETF
is three then 4%. And S&P 500 ETF is 12
then 18%.
And these are some key correlations here
that that I'm going to use in my
calculations and my analysis later on.
And the main question we're going to
explore today are what happens to risk
when you combine Tesla with bonds? Can
you build a portfolio that beats the S&P
500's return and with less risk? And
what's the optimal mix for someone for
someone my age? And how does correlation
create the free lunch of
diversification? And to do this, we're
going to be using the driver framework
once again, which stands for define and
discover, represent, implement,
validate, evolve, and reflect. So this
is my collab notebook here. And all I've
done is that I've thrown in the given
information from the problem into
collab. And I've told it to use the
driver framework. And I told it to use
the kiss principle as well. And uh this
is the output it gave me here.
And yeah, now I'll get on to the first
step which is define and discover. So
the first thing we need to define so
okay so first we need to define the
project in plain English and set
expectations. Uh this block of code here
isn't doing any math it's instead
documenting our objective and investor
profile so the rest of the analysis has
a clear constraint. So the objective
overall is uh to construct a diversified
investment portfolio that potentially
outperforms S&P 500 while taking on less
risk. uh this is our analysis uh goal
and we keep this as a reference. So
every decision we make is tied back to
the same objective. And then we have the
desired return which is basically just
potentially to outperform the S&P 500 as
well as the acceptable uh risk level
which is less risk than the S&P 500. And
uh these two strings restate the primary
su success criteria where we want higher
return and lower volatility than the S&P
500. That's our target to test against.
The young investor definition uh dict uh
explains why our acceptable risk might
be higher than a than a retired person's
because long horizons equal more time to
recover from downturns and for a
portfolio construction uh goal. This
concentrates the objective into a clear
sentence where we can display where we
can display in the notebook or on
slides. And finally for the appropriate
risk tolerance qualitative uh this
summarizes the expected behavior of the
of the portfolio and uh it which is
moderately aggressive but constrained to
stay below the S&P 500's volatility. And
when we run this cell we're going to
just see printed test printed test text
and uh the result is a documented
objective you can you can point back to
while interpreting results. This is
important for transparency as it tells
the viewers and myself what success
looks like before any modeling before
any modeling begins.
Now we want to represent here and now in
this block of code here we we're going
to represent the assets the assets and
their history. Uh this cell does a few
things in sequence build or load price
data compute returns and visualize both
prices and correlations. I'll walk
through the key parts. So the first part
is the uh np.random.c42
and this ensures the synthetic price
series are reproducible.
So the plots and numbers you show the
viewer don't change each run. uh if you
want different samples, remove or change
the seed. And second, we built three
price series which is which are the uh
S&P 500 prices,
the Tesla prices, and the bond prices
here. And these are the equations here
that we're going to use to find them.
And these lines pretty much create
synthetic but plausible but plausible
looking prices looking price series for
demonstration. Uh if I didn't have real
data, I would have placed it here. But
and this in this uh in this scenario I'm
going to use the data given to us in the
original uh problem statement given.
So uh third we are going to combine
those series into the data frame and
save them to data asset.csv.
This is this is just convenience so the
notebook reads the same file later. And
uh fourth
fourth we have the df= p readad csv. And
in this step, we're just reloading the
file and make the date and make the date
uh column the index to treat it as a
time series. And the fifth uh important
part here is the df.pect
change
uh drop. And this is really important
because this is what we're going to use
to convert prices into returns. Percent
changes between cons consecutive days
because portfolio math, correlations,
volatility, and annualization are all
done on returns and not raw prices. Uh
six, the display operations and uh these
let you visually confirm the data shape
and check the returns look and check
that the returns look reasonable.
Seventh, the plot series. Uh, this
visual here.
Uh, one second. Yeah, this visual here
confirms the relative trends and
volatility. The S&P and Tesla lines look
will look uh will look bumpier and
higher for higher volatility and bonds
will be smoother. Uh, the plot the plot
daily returns likewise. Uh here you will
see that the Tesla returns are spikier
while bond returns stay
stay near zero and uh finally for the uh
correlation for the correlation matrix
for the of asset returns and this pretty
much just calculates this calculates the
uh what's it called the pair wise
correlations between the asset returns
and shows them as a heat map. uh
correlation here is key is a key
ingredient for the diversification.
Numbers near one mean assets move
together. Numbers near negative one move
opposite and values near zero move
independently. This heat map visually
shows where diversification
can uh reduce portfolio varance variance
and uh so on the price plot here
on the price plot so we can easily tell
that uh the asset which is most volatile
is Tesla while the asset that's more uh
smooth is going to be the bond
and on the returns plot uh we can look
for the spikes and as we can clearly see
the spikes are in orange and orange
correlates to the Tesla stock here. Uh
whereas the more consistent ones around
zero are going to be your bond and S&P
500 stocks and in the correlation heat
map we can identify a low or negative
correlations as these are uh
diversification diversification
opportunities. For example, in the dummy
data the uh notebook reports
correlations like S&P Tesla uh is uh
0.68 68 and Tesla to bond is 0.16. And
those numbers mean Tesla and S&P move
together fairly often whereas Tesla and
bonds sometimes move oppositely which
reduces combined portfolio risk.
So now we're going to implement here and
pretty much in this cell uh we're just
showing the math. We implement uh the
Mont Carlo portfolio simulation to
explore many possible allocations among
the three assets. This is where we
quantify risk and return. So the nump
portfolios uh in that line we're just
we're we we are randomly generating
10,000 different portfolios. That's
enough that's enough to explore the
space without being too slow.
Then we have the old weights. So this is
to prelocate a matrix to store each
portfolio's weights for later reference
and plotting. We also have the portfolio
returns and this pre-allocates arrays to
store accumulative no to store uh what's
it called computive computed uh
annualized return and annualized risk
for each portfolio. We also have the
annualized returns where we're going to
compute daily mean returns and multiply
by 200 52 trading days to annualize the
expected return. Uh this is standard
when working with daily returns.
We also have the convariance matrix
which pretty much here we similarly here
we compute the daily uh convariance
matrix of returns and annualize it. The
conveyance matrix comper captures not
only each asset's variance but also uh
also how assets co-move which determs
which determines portfolio variance and
inside the loop here we have the weights
again. So the weights equals function
where we uh draw a random vector of of
positive numbers and normalize and
normalize so the weights sum to one and
each vector is a portfolio allocation
across S&P 500 Tesla and bond
and at the end part of that uh for loop
we also have again the uh all weights
where we are saving the weights for
later analysis so we can uh inspect the
weight mix of top portfolios.
Also in implement we have portfolio
returns where uh this is the portfolio
expected return is the weighted sum of
assets expected returns linear in
weight. And finally we also have a
portfolio risk where this is the key
formula here. Portfolio standard
deviation uh equals the formula given
given in the code here and uh it uses
the con convariance matrix and the
weights to compute the portfolio
variance then takes the square root for
standard deviation and this captures the
diversification effects via off diagonal
convariance loops.
uh after the loop we store the results
in dataf frame portfolio results with
columns for return risk and weight
columns and the display function here
I'll just print the first few portfolios
so we can inspect them
so what the viewer should look for and
what the and what what the results mean
each row in portfolio results is one
portfolio annualize is one portfolio's
annualized expected return and
associated annualized risk. Because
correlations are accounted for through
convariance matrix, portfolios that mix
assets with low or negative correlation
will typically uh show lower risk than a
sample weighted averages of individual
asset risk. That's diversification in a
in action. uh this data set is the raw
material for the next step which is to
uh compare the S&P 500 plotting the
cloud and selecting candidate
portfolios.
So next we're going to move on to
validate and in validate we're going to
uh compare the Mont the the Mont Carlo
cloud to the S&P 500 benchmark.
So the validate step isn't really that
long compared to other steps. So this
won't be this won't take too much time
here. So the first thing we got is the
S&P 500 annualized return which this
just computes the S&P's annualized
expected return the same way we computed
portfolio portfolio expected uh returns.
Then we also have the S&P annualized uh
risk which we're going to compute the
S&P's uh annualized volatility from the
daily standard deviation multiplied by
the square root of uh 252.
And we also uh the last function here
really is the comparison portfolio. So
for simplicity, this example prints the
first simulated portfolio. In practice,
we'd filter the portfolios to find those
that meet our objective, which is that
returns are uh greater than or less to
S&P return risk and uh less than S&P
risk or or search for the highest sharp
uh ratio. So the printed uh block here
shows the output of the code shows the
S&P analyze risk return and risk the
benchmark here. the selected portfolio
annualiz annualized return and risk and
the selected portfolio weights.
So how how should we interpret this code
here pretty much? So this this what I'm
going to explain now. So we're going to
compare the S&P numbers to to the
selected portfolio numbers. If the
selected if the if the selected
portfolio has a higher return and lower
risk, it sits in the desirable uh NW
quadrant of the plot which stands for
the higher return uh comma lower risk.
In the dummy run earlier, the example
portfolio returned uh 0.2 2564 and risk
of uh 01413
versus the S&P which is uh 0.0115
and the return
uh which is 0.79
uh97.
So uh note that was just one simulated
portfolio and results vary by run. Uh
the key is the method here, right? So we
now have quantitative redu reproducible
uh weighted check portfolios against the
benchmark.
So now finally we also have we also have
the evolve stage here. And pretty much
all this cell does is that it's going to
visualize the entire uh Monte Carlo
output and places the S&P 500 benchmark
on the same chart.
So this is the uh chart here pretty much
and this is how we're going to this is
how you read and interpret the chart. So
portfolios
uh to the left are lower risk and and
portfolios higher are higher return. Uh
the ideal portfolios for attractive are
above and to the left of the red star
which stands for the higher return lower
risk. Those are the ones that beat the
S&P on both metrics. While portfolios
down and to the right are worse, which
because they have lower risk for they
have lower return for more risk
and uh the spread of the cloud shows the
trade-offs. If the cloud contains points
northwest of the star that that that
confirms the possibility of beating the
S&P's return with less risk under our
simulated assumptions
and uh you can pick a point or run an
optimizer to find the front to find the
frontier. You can also change simulation
par parameters. For example, uh force
force or max force minimum maximum
weights uh or allowing or allow shorting
and rerun to see how the cloud moves.
This is why I call this this is why this
step is called evolve. We iterate and
tune the simulation until the portfolios
align with and with my preferences.
That's the whole point of the evolve
stage here pretty much.
And uh we're going to move on to the
reflect part here. And uh this final
code pretty much just summarizes the
insights and limitations. Uh so
pretty much here
uh what's it called? So the printed list
here as we can see uh calls out the big
picture. Simulated portfolios show show
a wide range of risk and return and
demonstrate the risk return trade-off.
Some portfolios
some portfolios lie northwest of the S&P
star indicating better historical uh
risk return profiles. Under these
assumptions, the
the limitation sections is also crucial.
Historical or stimulated past
performative past performance is not uh
indicative of future performance.
Correlations and volatilities change.
Our dummy data is a simplification and
the time pl and the time period matters
a lot. The young investor reflection
highlights that diversification is
especially revalent relevant for someone
with the high horizon. Combining uh
assets with low or negative correlations
can uh reduce portfolio volatility
without cutting expected return
uh as much as you might think.
So pretty much so what should I say
about the result? So we're going to
emphasize that the notebook demonstrates
the mechanics of portfolio construction
and diversification. It shows that under
reasonable assumptions, it's possible to
find allocations that historically have
better trade-offs than a single
benchmark. But to reiterate, it is not a
guarantee. It's just an instructive
reproducible exercise that helps you
think about trade-offs and design real
portfolios informed by history.
So now moving on to the summary here. So
this is the detailed analysis of our key
findings
and the overall investment objective is
to construct a diversified portfolio
aiming to potentially beat the S&P 500
with less risk suitable for a young
investor with a long-term horizon and
moderately high risk tolerance. Uh
so the the dummy file for the S&P test
for the S&P 500 Tesla and bond was
created to proceed the to proceed with
the analysis and visualizations of the
hypothetical uh historical prices and
returns of the assets were generated
showing trends in volatility. The cor
the correlation matrix of the
hypothetical asset returns returns was
calculated and visualized which this
indicates the relationship between
assets
between the between all assets
and pretty much for insights or next
steps. The simulation with dummy data
suggests that combining assets with low
or negative correlations can help
achieve better risk return pro profiles.
Further analysis with real historical
data is needed to validate these
findings. And finally, exploring methods
to identify optimal portfolio optimal
portfolios on the efficient frontier
for from the simulated portfolios would
provide more concrete recommendations
for asset allocation.
Okay. So now I'm going to go back and
answer these four main questions here,
the questions to explore pretty much.
And uh first, so the first question was
uh what happens to risk when you combine
Tesla with bonds? Right? So when Tesla
which as as I've showed you before in
the analysis a high volatility asset is
combined with bonds a low volatility
negatively negatively correlated asset
the overall portfolio risk decreases
significantly even though Tesla swings
wildly uh bonds move in opposite or
neutral directions during market drops
which stabilizes the portfolio and the
result of this is that you will still
capture some of Tesla's high return
potential but with but with a smoother
ride and smaller uh downturns I mean uh
draw down sorry and the second question
uh can you build a portfolio that beats
S&P 500's uh return with less risk and
yes we can do that so based on the Monte
Carlo simulation some portfolio
combinations outperformed the S&P 500's
annualized return while maintaining
equal or slightly lower risk the key is
balancing Tesla's growth
growth power with more stable assets
like bonds or the S&P 500 itself. The
result of this is divers mixes I like
for example 40% uh S&P 500 40% Tesla and
20% bonds often land above and to the
left of the S&P 500 on the risk return
scatter plot meaning higher returns and
lower risk. Uh third, what's the optimal
mix for someone your age? So as a young
investor, I can uh afford to take
moderately high risk because of my long
because of my long time horizon. An
optimal mix might be around like this is
a example here but 30% growth growth uh
stocks like Tesla and Apple 30% I would
put into diver side market exposure like
the S&P 500 ETF and 20% 20% into bonds
or defensive assets for risk control and
this mix of stocks I've invested in
allow strong compounding from equities
while uh cushioning volatility through
low-risk bonds which is ideal for
long-term growth.
And for the fourth question, uh how does
correlation create free lunch of
diversification? So correlation measures
how assets move together when assets
like Tesla and bonds uh have low or
negative correlation. They don't rise
and fall at the same time. So portfolio
volatility drops without sacrificing
returns. The result of this is divers
diversification creates a free lunch.
You can you can earn
uh you can earn similar or better
returns while taking on less total risk
uh because of how uncorrelated assets
asset offset each other during each
other's movement. So what's the big
overall take away from this? So
combining assets with with different
risk uh profiles and correlations
especially high growth especially high
growth tech and stable bonds reduces
volatility also while also improving
risk adjusted returns and can outperform
the market over time. For a young
investor the best move for me isn't to
go all in on one stock. It's learning
how divers it's learning how
diversification amplifies growth while
protecting me from extremes. So that is
my uh assignment for session six.
 
"
35716300,cbakota,Connor,Bakota,"Hello, welcome back to section six
0:05
assignment um for management 310. Today
0:08
we're going to be running over uh the
0:10
different um stock options and bond
0:12
options uh in correlation with um
0:15
whether to um have a higher risk or
0:18
return or both on um different portfolio
0:22
setups. So, one of the main things that
0:24
we're going to be going over today is
0:25
our understanding of the modern
0:27
portfolio. What is the modern portfolio?
0:29
So the modern portfolio here is the
0:32
understanding of you want to maximize
0:35
your expected return related to a
0:38
certain number of risk. Um so to do this
0:41
um we plug in um all we for my prompt we
0:45
plugged in our Tesla stock our Apple
0:48
Apple stock Johnson and Johnson Exon
0:50
Mobile Vanguard bond and our S&P 500 um
0:53
to understand um what our key
0:56
correlations are between these um and
0:58
finding the optimal mix for uh someone
1:00
our u my age. Um so doing this I
1:03
implemented all of this code asking uh
1:06
all of this prompt asking it to find the
1:08
best way to um correct find the correct
1:12
calculation of return standard deviation
1:14
and the sharp ratio um find accurate
1:16
portfolio construction and optimization
1:18
um through the modern portfolio outlook.
1:21
um proper understanding of risk return
1:22
trade-offs um and understanding the
1:24
diversification benefits and the
1:26
correlation of um said um the depth
1:28
beyond minimum requirements and then our
1:30
efficient frontier and multiple assets
1:32
idea um the quality of portfolio
1:34
recommendation based on risk tolerance
1:36
and the business insight into modern
1:38
portfolio theory application. So for all
1:40
this we plugged this into um Google
1:42
Gemini first which gave us all of this
1:44
and it basically helped me to understand
1:47
everything um a little bit better and
1:49
also gave me code to start off with
1:51
which I later um added more to to get a
1:54
better understanding and a little bit
1:55
more visuals behind what I what I was
1:57
learning.
1:58
So um the first thing that we want to
2:01
talk about um is the correct um
2:03
calculation standard deviation of the
2:04
sharp ratio um which we have right over
2:07
here. Um we'll go into this. Um so
2:09
there's a lot more to this. So we're
2:11
importing financial data um for this. Um
2:14
we have different assets and we're
2:15
labeling them as Tesla, Apple, J&J, X uh
2:19
Exxon which is XOM and then and then
2:21
bond for BND. Um and then it gives us
2:24
their returns um which is uh right here
2:26
and it also gives us their standard
2:28
deviations. And using this we use the
2:30
correlation matrix which basically shows
2:32
the idea of um two different um
2:36
portfolio
2:38
um the difference in portfolio. So Tesla
2:40
and Tesla be one but Apple and Tesla um
2:44
would be 65 and that varies throughout
2:46
the whole thing. So it's a matrix. We're
2:49
going to utilize that um for
2:50
correlation. And um so the correlation
2:54
um stat actually measure measures from
2:56
negative -1 to um positive one with um
3:00
and in this case um we want lower um
3:04
correlation um that actually performs
3:06
better um in the um matrix. So uh well
3:10
not in the matrix but in the stock
3:11
market um stocks with portfolios that
3:14
have better diversification
3:16
um actually um perform better. Um so
3:19
that actually leads us into the free
3:20
lunch understanding. Um the free lunch
3:22
is basically that if you diversify um
3:25
diversification is the only free lunch
3:27
in finance. Um the more diversified your
3:29
portfolio is the better it will perform
3:31
and the more optimized it is. Um so
3:33
getting um the correlation closer to a
3:36
negative one is actually better um than
3:38
having a positive correlation. You don't
3:41
want to have a correlation at all um to
3:43
your stocks because then they'll all
3:45
plummet at the same time if they do. Um
3:48
and then um our return um for the S&P
3:51
500 is 0.2 and the standard deviation
3:53
is8.
3:55
Um and then this is the number of
3:56
portfolios in our simul simulation and
3:58
our risk-free rate is 0.02. Um this is a
4:02
lot of portfolios in the simulation.
4:03
You'll see later in our chart how many
4:05
there are. Um and it also outline
4:07
different um ones as well. Um and then
4:10
right here we just have you know our
4:11
results. Um and then we have portfolio
4:14
returns down here and the weights um
4:16
considered with that um the
4:19
understanding of the formula for risk
4:22
which is down here with the co-variance
4:24
matrix matrix um and the sharp port um
4:29
uh the sharp um portal um and then the
4:32
plot and figure and the scatter um all
4:35
of this um kind of combines for the
4:36
formula for risk. So using the risk, you
4:38
use the standard deviation um squared.
4:41
Um but this basically goes down to the
4:45
weighted risk for one stock or bond plus
4:48
the weighted risk of the other one and
4:49
then plus the coariance between the two.
4:51
So if you go up here, this is kind of
4:52
the coariance and the correlation. So
4:54
the coariance between the two is also
4:56
added into this weighted risk um which
4:59
makes it a lot easier to understand once
5:00
you put in that term to find the formula
5:02
for risk. Um and that goes into our risk
5:05
return ratio. Um
5:08
so moving down here is basically this is
5:12
us forming our plot. So here's our plot
5:14
right here. Um this is the efficient
5:16
frontier of investment portfolios plot.
5:19
So the efficient frontier plot is
5:21
basically um a curved edge. Um and it's
5:23
set it's the set of best portfolios. Um
5:26
so basically um anything below this like
5:30
curve right here if it's over here
5:31
suboptimal. However, if it's up over
5:33
here it's optimal. So uh anything on
5:36
this line is you know the best is on the
5:40
efficient frontier of investment
5:41
portfolios. So we can see um we have the
5:44
maximum sharp ratio here and the minimum
5:46
uh volatility and then we have the S&P
5:49
500. So right here this is the uh access
5:52
of expected return and then this is the
5:54
portfolio risk. So low risk, decent
5:57
return right here. Um this is higher
6:00
risk a little bit better return. So,
6:02
anything on this plane right here, um,
6:05
this would be lower risk. So, if you're
6:06
up here and you're low risk and high
6:07
return, that's amazing. Um, but if
6:09
you're over here, higher risk, low
6:10
return, not good. Um, so you're kind of
6:13
aiming for on this line right here
6:14
where, um, risk and return ratio are
6:16
about equal. Um, but we'll get more into
6:20
that later. Um, so right here, the S&P
6:22
500 metrics, uh, we see the return is
6:24
about 12% and the risk is about 18%. Um
6:27
the ven minimum volatility portfolio the
6:29
return is about 4.99% and the risk is
6:32
4.42%.
6:33
The sharp ratio is about 68 um about 68.
6:38
Um the allocation would be Tesla at
6:39
50.51%
6:42
um uh Apple at 5.45%
6:45
J&J at 3.44% and then Exxon um at 11.76%
6:50
and the bond at 78.85% a 5% which is the
6:54
minimum volatility portfolio would have
6:55
more in bonds because bonds are a little
6:57
bit more stable than stocks are because
6:59
you know there's less ris less risk and
7:01
a reasonable return. But for a maximum
7:04
sharp sharp ratio portfolio which is the
7:06
optimal one um you see that the return
7:09
would be about 7.26%
7:11
compared to the 4.99% um in the minimum
7:14
volatility and the risk would be about
7:15
4.82%. which is not much more uh on the
7:18
risk uh of the minimum volatility and
7:20
the sharp ratio is about.90.
7:23
Um and then the allocation would be
7:24
Tesla at 2.86% Apple at 10.09% J&J at
7:29
18.82%
7:30
um Exxon at 5.92% and then the bond
7:34
being lower than um the minimum
7:36
volatility but at 62.31%.
7:39
So with this allocation, this is would
7:41
be a more optimal figure for um
7:45
uh our um
7:48
for our portfolio um decision. So that
7:51
red one is probably where we want to be
7:53
at. Um and uh going forward um it also
7:58
asked us a little bit about how Tesla
8:01
and the bond um would perform together.
8:04
So, kind of just giving you an idea on
8:06
this chart. Uh Tesla is on like the far
8:09
right and the upper high. So, high risk,
8:12
high return. That's kind of the idea
8:14
behind port um the uh Tesla stock. Um
8:17
but for a bond, it would be far left. Um
8:20
and uh far left and and low down right
8:24
here. Um so that idea of them coming
8:26
together uh to coming together they have
8:28
a negative correlation of a negative uh
8:31
0.20 2, which makes it curve left. And
8:34
like we said earlier, with a negative
8:36
correlation, it's actually better
8:37
because they don't have much in common.
8:40
Um, basically um a 50/50 mix of Tesla B
8:44
Tesla and the bond um has a much lower
8:47
risk um compared to um just going all
8:51
Tesla or just going all bond. Um and you
8:53
can see this in this down here. So this
8:56
is um an imported um uh chart um of code
9:02
that we did to compare the Tesla and
9:03
bond stock as stated. Uh up here in the
9:06
uh instructions we have um can you build
9:09
a portfolio uh that beats the S&P 500
9:11
return with less risk. Uh we use that
9:13
right here. This is beating it with less
9:15
risk but also having a high optimal. Um
9:18
and then we already talked about our
9:20
free launch and diversification. Um and
9:22
then now we're going to be talking about
9:23
what happens when you combine Tesla with
9:25
the bonds. So right here we have um the
9:28
asset of Tesla and the bond, the mean
9:30
returns, standard deviations, and then
9:32
the correlation of -20 uh which we
9:34
talked about and that's actually better
9:36
because less correlation means better
9:38
returns normally. Um and then the
9:41
variance um and the risk uh equation
9:44
which we talked about which is you know
9:45
the idea of um
9:49
weighted risk of one weighted risk of
9:50
another and then the coariance added
9:52
together. Um and then this is us
9:54
plotting our chart. Uh in here you can
9:56
see um the Tesla weight, the bond
9:59
weight, and the portfolio return
10:01
portfolio risk with 0% um Tesla. There's
10:05
actually um 4% risk. Um but as you add
10:09
more um
10:11
uh Tesla weight um you actually get more
10:15
return for risk added as you can see um
10:18
going up the chart. Um so you get with
10:21
only.3%
10:22
uh more risk you get a whole 1 uh60%
10:26
more of return. Um so basically doing
10:29
this we understand that a 50-50 mix of
10:31
Tesla bond um would actually be the most
10:34
optimal way um to do it. You don't want
10:36
to just do fully one bond or fully one
10:38
Tesla. That wouldn't be um the best way.
10:40
And as you can see right here, it's a
10:42
left curve um in this bond um with the
10:45
portfolio for the expected return.
10:48
Um
10:50
moving forward from that, those are both
10:52
our codes. We'll run these real quick.
10:54
They both work and give us our outcomes.
10:57
We'll run this one as well.
11:01
But now we're looking more into the idea
11:05
of
11:07
why uh like what is our optimal um what
11:11
is our optimal at our age. Um so we want
11:15
to use the um maximum sharp ratio um
11:20
portfolio. The time we have the time
11:22
horizon um to weather the market
11:24
volatility. uh if I was older and I
11:26
wasn't in my early 20s, we'd probably
11:28
want to go for a much more uh risk
11:30
averse um portfolio. However, we're
11:33
young and we have a lot more time
11:35
horizon in the market than other people.
11:39
So, with this model portfolio, we want
11:40
to have about 30% Apple, 30% Vanguard
11:43
bond, um and then a 20% Johnson and
11:46
Johnson, um about uh 15% Tesla, and
11:50
about 5% Exon Mobile. That's roughly
11:53
what we have here as well. um a little
11:55
bit different um but this is the one
11:56
that we've engineered for optimism uh
11:59
optimization I mean um and this is the
12:02
understanding that um the bond um alloc
12:06
of the 30% allocation bonds are primary
12:09
risk management tool um uh their
12:12
negative correlation to stocks means
12:14
that they act as a powerful break during
12:16
market downturns um and then the Exxon
12:19
is like an all-weather tire it says a
12:21
small allocation to a different sector
12:23
like energy adds another layer of
12:25
diversification. And we know
12:26
diversification helps because uh
12:28
negative correlation um actually makes
12:30
our um risk go down. Um uh we don't want
12:34
to go with like 100% of one stock. It's
12:36
too aggressive. Um it's like driving a
12:39
rocket as a you know relation with no
12:41
brakes or steering wheel. Uh it's not
12:43
investing. It's more of a gambling when
12:44
you're putting all all of your money
12:46
into stocks. Doesn't really make sense
12:48
for your portfolio. Um but just going
12:50
all bonds and S&P 500 alone, it's too
12:53
conservative. You don't want to just be
12:54
conservative. You want to find that
12:55
50-50 mix that optimizes your money with
12:58
the risk return ratio at a, you know,
13:00
relatively uh reasonable point. Um, at
13:03
your 20s, you don't want to just be too
13:05
conservative. You want to, uh, make your
13:07
money work and, you know, put a little
13:08
bit of risk because you have time to
13:10
recover from those. Um, so going through
13:13
what we've talked about today, um, we
13:16
understand, um, the cor the correct
13:19
calculation of our returns and our
13:20
standard deviation. We understand that
13:22
and we have our sharp ratio here. Um we
13:24
have a proper understanding of risk
13:25
return trade-offs. We understand that um
13:28
we still need some risk to have higher
13:30
return and if you have uh low risk and
13:33
low return it's not really helping you
13:34
at this time. Um uh we understand that
13:39
diversification the free lunch um idea
13:41
is that diversification is the only free
13:43
lunch in finance. Um and that
13:45
correlation um having a negative
13:46
correlation um between stocks in this
13:48
diversification is actually better
13:49
because it acts as a break for certain
13:51
things. Um when one stock goes bad then
13:54
you have a bond to equal it out. Um and
13:56
then we understand the efficient
13:57
frontier anything that's below this line
14:00
right here is suboptimal and anything
14:02
above it you ride that because that's
14:04
optimal. Um and and then the multiple
14:08
assets. We understand that divers
14:09
diversification and not just one asset
14:11
um is the way to do it because of the
14:13
modern portfolio look of optimizing how
14:15
many um uh different assets you have. Um
14:20
and as I just said the business side of
14:22
modern portfolio theory applications we
14:24
want to optimize our money. We want to
14:25
optimize our risk and return ratio. So
14:27
that's what um we do. And we want to
14:29
always be playing on this line and
14:31
nothing below. Um and always do anything
14:33
above if if it if uh given the
14:35
opportunity. And we understand that you
14:37
know the correlation between two stocks
14:39
it being negative is always better um in
14:42
a diversified um portfolio that is
14:44
wanting to take risks. Um so yeah,
14:47
that'll wrap it up for our assignment
14:49
here today. Um we showed that our code
14:51
runs. We've gone through all of our um
14:53
financial concepts and understanding. Um
14:56
and we've gotten these return ratios and
14:58
percentages of what we should do um and
15:00
the risk correlated and the return uh
15:02
correlated to each.
15:04
Hello. Uh this is Connor from a
15:07
different day. Uh I just wanted to come
15:09
back and clarify a little bit more about
15:11
um this code. I added a little bit more
15:13
after I had you know done a very good
15:16
explanation of what I had. Um I just
15:18
wanted to come back and um uh let's
15:21
refresh this code to show that we have
15:23
new code here. Um so what I the one
15:27
thing that I added on the fishing
15:28
frontier just to you know add extra
15:30
clarification is we added all the stock
15:33
options. So we have Tesla, Apple, J&J uh
15:37
X XOM and then uh the bond stock as
15:40
well. And just like I explained in the
15:41
other one um the bonds down here and
15:44
Tesla's up there. I'd already stated
15:45
that um but I wanted to come back and
15:47
really show you you know in perspective
15:49
where everything lies. Apple's another
15:51
very great you know high risk but pretty
15:53
high reward as well. Um and that's just
15:56
um the efficient frontier in comparison
15:58
to all the other bonds in the S&P 500
16:01
and our sharp ratio. Um I already gone
16:04
over all the standard deviation earlier
16:06
on in my video. Uh the other thing that
16:08
I added um was an asset correlation
16:11
matrix heat map. Um I think it's a
16:13
really important thing to have in there.
16:14
Uh just for more understanding of the
16:16
correlation. Uh we already talked about
16:18
how negative correlation is actually
16:20
sometimes better. Um but positive not as
16:23
well in this in stocks. Um so you can
16:26
see you know the bond um negative
16:28
correlation between it and Tesla which
16:31
makes it good. Negative correlation
16:32
between it and Apple J&J and all that
16:36
but bond and bond together bad
16:37
correlation. Bad correlation with this
16:40
bad correlation with this. Um even Apple
16:42
and Apple bad correlation. Um
16:46
or Apple and Tesla terrible correlation.
16:49
Um it's just a heat map showing you um
16:51
different um bonds um in comparison to
16:54
each other uh on this uh correlation
16:57
heat map which is already shown up here
17:00
but puts it you know in a visual. Um the
17:04
final thing that I added um outside of
17:06
you know this risk and return up here is
17:08
I made it a little bit easier to read
17:09
down here. a left bow is really good. Um
17:13
however um we're adding um the
17:17
percentages of how much Tesla stock is
17:19
added um each time. So you know we have
17:22
0% Tesla stock and you have the risk and
17:25
the uh um expected return um and as you
17:28
go up and you increase um Tesla stock uh
17:31
more risk um and higher expected return.
17:35
Um so th those are the you know closing
17:37
remarks I wanted to add and some like um
17:39
different things that I wanted to try to
17:41
add to uh help the explanation of all
17:43
this. Thank you."
37433259,creanc,Colin,Crean,"00:00 How's it going? My name is Colin Crean and this is my session six assignment. So for my mission, I just start, I just started my first job and want to invest my $10,000 signing up.
00:08 Bonus. My colleagues are just going all in on Tesla because it's the future. My parents, they stick with an S and P 500 index fund, and I want to build my own portfolio.
00:16 So now I will go over to my session six assignment. Screen over. Hold up. Let's see if we can move that here.
00:33 Yeah. Alright. There we go. Sorry. Okay. So for my session, six assignment to find and discover what is my investment goal?
00:40 Personally, I would consider myself more of a safe investor. So as a young conservative investor with. The long term horizon for investing.
00:47 Some of them, some of the questions I want to explore, can I achieve returns that beat the S and P 500 over the long run?
00:52 While taking on similar or lower amount of risk. Is it worth it to take on a risky stock like Tesla, which my colleague suggested?
00:59 My primary concern is optimizing the risk return trade-off and not eliminating risk overall. What risks concern me the most? If I invest in Tesla, losing a big chunk of my $10,000 due to a bad month, which is a volatility risk.
01:13 If I invest in bonds, paying it, playing it too safe, and my money grows very slowly. Slowly over time, it gets eroded by inflation, and it's the inflation risk, and just overall, the risk of doing worse than the S&P 500.
01:23 So the key info I'm provided with is. Which is, it's hypothetical five-year data. So, for Tesla, average return rate of 35%, standard deviation, which is risk.
01:33 Or volatility of 60%. Apple, return 22%, risk 28%. Johnson & Johnson, return 9%. Risk, 15%. ExxonMobil, return 8%.
01:44 Risk, 25%. Vanguard Bond, return 9%. S&P 3%. Risk, 4%. S&P 500, return 12%. Risk, 18%.
01:54 And then the key correlations. So Tesla to Apple is 0.65, which is a strong correlation in me and it's positive.
02:01 Positive, which means they, a strong positive correlation. They move together. Johnson, Johnson, Exxon Mobil 0.30, a weaker correlation. So they somewhat move together.
02:09 Because it's still positive Tesla and Johnson and Johnson, negative 0.10, a negative correlation. So they move slightly opposite and stocks and bonds have a negative 0.20.
02:17 A negative correlation, so they move opposite. It's also slightly opposite, but it's more opposite than the negative 0.10. So for represent, in a word doc I made a scatter plot where the x-axis is the standard deviation and the y-axis is the return rate, and a heat correlation method.
02:33 So I'll show those here. Okay. So for my scatter plot, uh, you can see here, the risk is on the x-axis, and the return rate is on the y-axis.
02:46 And from the left to the right, so this is the bond, this is Johnson and Johnson. And this is the SMP.
02:51 This is Exxon. This is Apple. And this is Tesla. Some things that jump out at us are Tesla is an outlier over here.
02:57 It takes. Exxon is a whole lot of risk, but it also gives you the most return here at 35%. And then the bond over here is.
03:05 It's playing extremely safe. You have almost no risk, but you're also getting no return. And then another thing that jumps out is Axon mobile provides a significant amount more risk than Johnson & Johnson and the S&P 500, but it also returns less than them.
03:19 So Axon mobile is kind of, it's not all that And then here's the heat correlation map. So you could see here when a bond is mixed with any of the stocks, it's a negative 0.20.
03:29 When Exxon Mobil is mixed with Johnson & Johnson, it's a 0.30. Uh, when Johnson & Johnson is mixed with, uh, Tyson, it's a 0.1.
03:39 Uh, when Apple is mixed with Tesla, it's a 0.65. That's all of them right there. Go back. Okay.
03:52 So, by these data points, these two displays, we were able to visualize the returns, the volatility, and the correlations before we move into the implement step.
04:00 So, for the implement step, the first question we are going to explore is what happens when we combine the Tesla and the bond.
04:06 Through the Python, through Python code, we are going to evaluate this portfolio. Return and the portfolio risk for this combination.
04:12 And here's the Python code. So first we have Tesla here, 0.35%, uh, return 60% risk, the bond 3% return, 4% risk, the weights, 50, 50 portfolio, the correlation negative 0.25%.
04:26 20. Then here's the formula for the simple weighted average right here. And then here's the portfolio. For the risk right here.
04:39 And there's more stuff here and okay. So we move on. So, the 50-50 bond, or the 50-50 Tesla bond portfolio analysis.
04:48 So the portfolio return is 19%. Uh, here's the variance. So it adds up the variance from the Tesla, the variance from the bond, the variance from the correlation, .0880.
04:58 And you get the actual portfolio risk of 29.66. And then here is the risk if we just took the average of the Tesla.
05:06 32.0, but it's, that's the wrong way to do it. But it was, we did it just for some analysis here.
05:12 And then the conclusion that the code made by combining. These two negatively correlated assets, the portfolio's risk is significantly lower than the simple average of the two assets.
05:22 As you can see from the code, when combining Tesla with the bond, you get a return of 19% with a portfolio risk of 29.66.
05:29 You get the risk by taking the square root of the total portfolio variance, which we saw up there. If you just took the simple average risk, which is the wrong way to do it, you would get a risk of 32%, which is 2.34% more risk than the actual portfolio risk.
05:43 This demonstrates why diversification is free lunch. Because the correlation between the stock and the bond, which is negative 0.20 creates free lunch through the diversification.
05:52 The negative correlation, even though it is relatively weak. Means that sometimes when the bond or the stock is underperforming, the other one is doing the opposite and is performing well.
06:00 This is how you offset your risks with diversification. Say we put all our money into Tesla and it underperformed, then you would lose your money.
06:07 However, because we diversified and put half into a bond, and because of the negative 0.20 correlation, when the Tesla stock underperformed, the bond could be performing well and offsetting the risk by creating the free lunch.
06:18 Through the diversification. For the next part of the implement section, we're going to answer one of the questions and try to build a portfolio to beat the S and P 500 returns with a weapon.
06:26 That's risk. I'm going to try a three asset mix of 40% Apple, 20% Tesla, and 40% bond. And here's the Python code.
06:34 So as you see here, here, um, the code's here. We have the Apple, the Apple, this is the correlations right here.
06:41 So this, sorry, this right here defines the portfolio weight. So 40%, 20%, 40% for Apple, Tesla bond. Then here's the correlations.
06:50 An Apple Tesla correlation 0.65, an Apple bond, negative 0.20 Tesla bond, negative 0.20. Cause it's the stock bond correlation. Calculating the portfolio risk here, all that stuff.
07:03 So we'll go down to here. So, this is the three asset portfolio. There's a correlation matrix, covariance matrix, and the final calculations it came up with was a portfolio risk.
07:15 A return of 17%, a portfolio risk of 20.78%, and then here's the portfolio variance of 0.0432. So as you can see, we were not surprised.
07:23 We were in making the portfolio beat the returns of the S&P 500 with less risk. Because the S&P 500 had a 12% return, so we were hoping to beat it there, but it had an 18% risk, which is less.
07:34 Though this portfolio did beat the returns by about 5%, it was also about 2% riskier. If was willing to take on the 2% larger risk for 5% bigger returns in this portfolio would be great.
07:44 I'm going to try one more portfolio here of 30% Tesla, 30% Tesla. Johnson and Johnson and 40% bond to try to see if I can beat the S and P 500.
07:51 So the same thing here, here's the average returns, the average risk. Uh, the weight, 30, 30, 40%. Uh, the correlations, moving to here.
08:03 So here's portfolio, same stuff here, the weight, correlation matrix, covariance matrix. And the final calculations were given here. Um, portfolio return of 14.40% variance 0.0316 and the risk of 17.78%.
08:19 So as you can see here, by making the portfolio of 30% Tesla, 30% Johnson and Johnson, and 40% bond, we were successfully able to make a portfolio.
08:27 With a higher return, 14.40% and a lower risk, 17.78%. Then the S and P is 12% return and 18% risk.
08:34 Now we're going to add. The Sharpe ratio to this code and we are going to calculate the Sharpe rate, Sharpe ratio for my custom portfolio and the Sharpe ratio for the S&P 500 and compare them.
08:44 So it's the same exact code, except, uhm, to have the this section you add calculating the Sharpe ratio. So this is the, uhm, there's the equation right there and I also put the equation down here.
09:03 So this is what it outputted. So the same thing we have here, all this stuff. Portfolio return, return 14.40, risk of 17.78, and we're also using a risk-free rate for the.
09:15 Sharpe ratio of 3.0, 3%, sorry. And then the custom portfolio, my custom portfolio, the Sharpe ratio is 0.6. And that's the P500 was 0.500.
09:28 Okay. Now we added onto this code the Sharpe ratio for my portfolio of 0.6411 and the Sharpe ratio of the S&P 500 of 0.500.
09:39 In this code, we use a risk-free rate of 3% since we weren't provided one, and this is the return rate of the bond, which is the most risk-free rate we were provided.
09:49 What the Sharpe ratio tells us is an investment's risk-adjusted return. It answers the question of whether how much return am I getting for the amount of volatility I am taking on.
09:59 A larger Sharpe ratio is better because it means you are obtaining more reward for the amount of volatility. Therefore, my portfolio provides us with more reward for the amount of risk compared to the S and P 500.
10:09 Now for the validate section, this section, I'm going to make it a table that summarizes all of my findings. It's going to include the average return, the risk, and the Sharpe ratio.
10:17 So as you can see here, we have the 100% Tesla, Apple, John Deere. Johnson, Johnson, Exxon bond S and P 500.
10:22 Then we have the 50 Tesla 50% bond. 40 Apple, 20 Tesla, 40 bond. And then the second portfolio, I just tried just 30% Tesla, 30% Johnson, Johnson, 40% bond.
10:34 Now I have down here, the Sharper. Ratio formulas, the average return minus the risk free rate divided by the volatility.
10:41 So for Tesla, 35% return, 60% risk free risk, we already knew that, they provided that, and they gave us a sharp ratio of 0.5333.
10:48 For Apple, 0.6786. For Johnson & Johnson, 0.4000. Exxon, 0.2000. The Bond, 0.0000. For the S&P 500, 0.5000.
11:00 For Tesla, 50 Tesla, 50 Bond, 0.5394. For the first portfolio, 0.6737. And for the second portfolio, 0 0.6411. So there's all the Sharpe ratios there.
11:13 So now for the Evolve. Moving on to the Evolve side. For the Evolve section, I wanted to run a simulation and get a scatterplot with 100 random simulations.
11:22 For the random simulations, I asked to make sure, The code distinguished the portfolio with the minimum risk, the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio, and the singular ones like the 100% Tesla, the ones we were provided.
11:33 And so here's the code. It's all through here. And it outputted us a graph of a scatterplot right here.
11:47 So, optimal portfolio details for the 100 simulation. So, we had the maximum sharp ratio, portfolio details, portfolio with the minimum risk right here.
11:58 And it's, they're marked on the graph here. So as you can see, here's Tesla way up here, Apple, Exxon, S&P 500.
12:04 It was given with a star, the Johnson Johnson, the bond, and then the green star is the maximum sharp ratio, which is right here.
12:12 And then the blue star is the minimum risk portfolio, which is right here. So some things we can take away from this are if we wanted to find.
12:20 Uhm, you know, a mix that takes on less risk than the S&P 500, but gives it more return, you want to look at, you know, these dots all right here, because they're to the left of the S&P 500, you know, but they're still above the S&P 500.
12:36 So they're less risky, but they're giving more returns, right? Tesla is still an ally or it's way up because it has so much risk, but it's also provides so much return.
12:44 Uhm, and then, yeah, the minimum, the portfolio with the minimum risk is giving you a return of 6.66%. And a risk of 5.16.
12:55 So that's right here. And then the portfolio, and this is the portfolio with the minimum risk percentage. And then the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio has a return of 9.81% with a risk of 9.34%.
13:08 And a Sharpe ratio of 0.7292. And the weight for that, for the maximum Sharpe ratio was, uh, Tesla. So a 13.57% Johnson and Johnson 41.22 and the bond 45.22.
13:22 And then for the minimum risk, the, uh, Portfolio is Tesla 6.46 Johnson Johnson 26.60 and bond 66.94 So moving on.
13:34 As you can see from the scatter plot, we were able to see all the important individual points. You can see that there's not a lot of separation and it's hard to make a portfolio.
13:40 That stands out from the rest. You can see they're all kind of on a line here. You know, there's obviously outliers up here and outliers down here with the bond, Exxon, S&P.
13:49 Like, they're off, but all these dots, you know, from the mixture of them are all kind of in a similar area over here, you know.
13:57 Tesla is an outlier because it generates a ton of return, but also has a lot of volatility. And you can see here.
14:05 Yeah, I'm recording a video. Um, you can see here all the different possible outcomes you can make with the different portfolios.
14:13 So, my reflection here, overall I learned a lot today about creating a portfolio of diversification. I learned that the portfolio risk is not an advertisement.
14:21 It is a much more complex than that. Correlation plays a massive part in the risk and we talked about that.
14:29 Earlier, that the correlation is how you make a free lunch of diversification. When you combine two assets that don't perfectly, that don't move.
14:37 And when the correlation is negative, the effect is even stronger. I was extremely surprised with- with. Whenever I mix a stock with a bond, how much the bond reduce the risk?
14:49 For example, in the 50% Tesla, 50% bond portfolio, the bond- To help reduce Tesla's normal 60% volatility to 29.66%. For someone my age now, the optimum mix is personal.
15:01 Some people are aggressive, or some people are very conservative. For someone my age I would say to go more towards the middle because I'm young, so I have a lot of time to- to generate wealth, and if I take on a bit more risk and it goes wrong, then I still also have a lot of time to recover.
15:14 And now my final point is that historical returns in quarterly- organizations cannot predict the future. Just because Tesla generated a 35% return in the past does not mean it will happen in the end of the future.
15:23 Correlations will also change over time. Looking at historical returns and correlations is a powerful guide for building a logical portfolio, but it is not a crystal ball for predicting the future.
15:32 Sure. Ah, thank you for listening, and that was my session six assignment."
34593722,beebe9,Spencer,Beebe,"You want to build your own portfolio? To my section 6 assignment. So we're just going to use this data here. Spencer Beebe. Umm, for Tesla, Apple and all the other bonds and stocks? Umm, so let's just go over the assignment first here. And then these key correlations will keep those in mind. And then the questions to explore what happens to risk when you combine Tesla with bonds? Can you build a portfolio that beats the S&P 500 return with less risk? So we just get a $10,000 signing bonus that we want to invest. Umm, colleagues suggest Tesla because it's the future. Uh, parents say stick with the S&P 500. And what is the optimal risk for someone your age? How does this correlation create the free lunch of diversification? All right, so we'll use the driver framework here and just go step by step. So I do have. A little. A dock here that I've pre made. Umm. So we'll start with the first here. Define indiscover. So what are our main goals here? Investment goal and what risks? So main goal build long-term wealth. I mean, we're only, this is our first job out of college. So we want to be able to, you know, build long term assets. We want to protect, protect our principal from large losses. So we want to minimize risk. And then we want to learn investing through diversification. So, you know, not putting all of our eggs in one basket. So the key question here, should you follow the colleagues advice and go all in on Tesla or your parents advice? Only the S&P 500? Or build a balanced portfolio that diversifies in multiple aspects. So that's the main question, main risks, market volatility, big swings and value, especially like Tesla, Apple, they're, they're vile tile stocks. They could swing up and down pretty easily. Uh, to losing money early. You know, it is our first investment. So we don't want to, you know, lose everything immediately. We want to preserve the capital, uh, and then over concentration risk. So we can't, we can't rely on one company. We have to be able to divers. So those are the main risks. And then our key question is, you know, what is the best balanced portfolio that we can build. So go right down to R represent. Umm, visualize returns, validity and correlations. So I built built this little kind of graph here. So it's the average return and then the, umm, standard deviation of risk. So we have Tesla, umm, 35 percent, 60%. So that just shows that it's extremely volatile, but it has high upside. Umm, but it's that comes with high risk. Umm, so high risk, high reward basically. Apple is a little bit less volatile, umm, and still has strong growth and a little bit less risk. Uh, Johnson and Johnson. It's stable, defensive. It's not going to grow too much. It's not going to, you know, diminish too much. It's pretty stable. Exxon Mobil umm. It's uh. You know, it's tied to the oil markets and it's, umm. Silical, so it's going to go around depending on, you know, what time of season it is. And then the Vanguard bond is very safe and stabilizing, very low risk, but also very little return. Uh, and then the S&P 500, which is the benchmark is going to be 12%, umm, average return and 18% risk. So that's kind of what we're going on. We want to beat that 12 percent, 18% S&P 500 while using, you know, maybe a couple of different aspects. Here. With the correlations, so that .65 between Tesla and Apple both shows that they, they move together. So if one goes up, the other one is going to go up, one goes down, the other goes down. Uh, it's a very umm. You know, they're very tied together in the tech industry. Umm, we got Johnson and Johnson and Exxon Mobil, but the .3, So that's a moderate correlation. Umm, it's basically the difference between sectors, defensive or cyclical, Tesla versus Johnson, Johnson is a -.7, so that's a low correlation. So that helps diversification. So it's kind of an inverse, umm, relationship. If one of them were to go up, the other one would go down and vice versa. So that helps, uh, diminish, umm. You know, large losses. Stocks and bonds have a negative .2, so that's an inverse relationship. Uh, similar to Johnson and Johnson and Tesla? So the interpretation of all this, Tesla and Apple are high risk, high return bonds are low, low risk, low return. Johnson and Johnson and Exxon Mobil provide stability and moderate returns. Uh, but they are tied to, you know, those different sectors there. So combining these assets provides the free lunch diversification, uh, that was talked about, uh, in this, uh, how does correlation create the free lunch of diversification? Sorry, here, just that diversification reduces the total portfolio risk because assets don't move all in the same direction. So you have that variety and diversification. So moving down to the implement stage, build your portfolio analysis with real historical data, and then we'll build a, a code, uh, using, uh, collab here. So, uh, I built a graph I guess. I'll show you the code. First we'll go over the code. So this is the code. So I had ChatGPT and Gemini kind of work on this together with me here. So this is the returns for all the stocks and bonds and the standard deviations of the risk, umm the correlation matrix. So how everything applies with everything else? Umm, that we have the portfolio return. The portfolio standard deviation and then the simple risk return trade off measure. So that's what the first part is going to calculate. Then we also have. The uh. Sharp weight ratio. Optimal weights portfolio returns. Umm, so it's just going to basically tell us, you know what each of these are, uh. Gonna get back, so here we go. So available investments, Tesla, Apple, Johnson, Johnson, Exxon and then the bond. So the optimal portfolio results here. So this is how it's saying we should split up our portfolio. Tesla at only 1.69 percent, 6%, almost 7% Apple, 13% Johnson and Johnson, 3% Exxon and then 75. So basically it's saying give us 75 bonds and a 25% stock split. So it's very, uh, on the conservative side there. So the expected return on that is 5.78, and the risk is only 3.8. So very low risk, umm, and a somewhat moderate return there. And the trade off is going to be a 1.52 ratio. So compare that to the S&P 500. Your return is lower, but the risk is much lower. So it's more efficient, but overall it does not beat the S&P 500. So giving this uh data ahead, it create another code here umm. And it's just a graph to show how if you were to apply each of the stocks with bonds, how that would affect standard deviation and the expected return. So as you can see, Tesla. Umm, definitely the highest risk for a stock, but it also has the potential for the most return. Umm second is going to be Apple. And then third is going to be Exxon Mobil, so Johnson and Johnson clearly the most stable. Low risk. Stock there uh, but if you did want to go for more growth, you know, Apple or Tesla would be a better choice, but it is just a little bit more risky. Alright, so let's go back to our. Our document here, so this is just a, this is the risk versus return of a diverse for portfolio. So if you were to go 5050 with the Tesla and bonds, so that's going to be this point right here. Umm, that's going to be this X right there. So very high risk, very high return potential. If you were to go with your parents S&P 500, that's all the way down here, that's that blue X. So you know, much lower risk with the potential of some return, but not very high. And then the aged optimized portfolio is going to be this green so. Much lower risk than Tesla and bonds, but also a very high potential for expected returns. So now let's move on to. DV umm, validate. So let's compare portfolio metrics with benchmarks. So kind of what we just did. So this is what the code from Python gave us. If we were to optimize our stocks and bonds through a 7525 split with these percentages, uh, for each, that's going to give us that green dot. Umm. So now let's let's validate this so #1 constraint verification. So the risk is 3.8% is well below, you know, that 12 limit. Umm, meaning it's, you know, safe within the comfort zone of a new investor. And you do have an expected return of 7.8, which is realistic given bonds yield, uh, yields and moderate stock exposure. It's in line with conservative portfolios with an average return of five per 6% annually. Umm, However, it is lower than the return of the S&P 500. Compared to Tesla's 60% validity or the S&P's 18%, this is only a 3.8%, which is showing how, you know, stocks and bonds combined dramatically reduce the total risk, nearly 80% reduction, uh, in portfolio swings. So, uh, it's very, very important to diversify with bonds and stocks, uh, to litigate the potential for large losses. And then for practical implementation. So we'll build, build this basically, so for a $10,000 investment. It's going to be $169 of Tesla, 679 of Apple, little over 1300 of Johnson and Johnson, 325 for the Exxon, and then, uh, little over 7500 for the bond. So in summary, this portfolio is safe, umm, it's diversified and it outperforms the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. So if you were to, you know, adjust the risk to the return compared to the S&P 500, it is higher, so. Looking at that. That's probably going to be the most optimal solution. It would be a 7525 split with the individual stocks there. So that's this graph kind of just shows the difference of how you would split them. So this conservative 7525 is what is recommended all the way down here. Umm, it's the lowest risk, umm, but the most efficient. Umm, you know, expected return percentage compared to risk percentage. So if you were to go to aggressive, you know, let's say Tesla and bonds, basically, umm, very high risk, very high reward. S&P 500 is kind of in the middle there, uh, a growth umm, so that's 25% bond, 75% stocks, uh, you know, higher risk, but. It's kind of in the middle there, a little less than the SP 500, but it also has a little bit less of risk involved. Uh, and then the balanced, you know, that 5050, umm, you know, it may seem like a better option than the conservative, uh, or the S&P 500. However, if you were to break it down, the percentage of increase is not as greater than the conservative portfolio. So now it's, uh, let's move to the evolve section here. How does changing the mix affect risk and returns? So I created this little chart here. Umm won't be investing forever, so you want to be able to grow it, Umm, you know, confidently. So this is the strategy conservative, balanced, growth, aggressive kind of with this chart here shows. Expected return and then the implied risk and then that's going to give us the Sharpe ratio. Um, so you know, the higher it is, the less. The the greater efficiency it is. Umm, so you know, you look at. A balanced fifty-five, it's still going to be, you know, less than the conservative umm, and that's just because the expected return. Uh, percentage is, you know, less than the risk. The only one you're going to find a higher expected return than the risk is going to be that conservative. Umm, so that's, that's why I would recommend that. So if you were to look at this, if you wanted to just do, you know, 1 stock, 1 bond, this is the return and then the risk involved with that. So Apple is going to be, you know, the greatest. Option here. It does have a pretty high risk, but it does have a decent return, so it's going to be the best balanced. But still, I wouldn't recommend that. I think as we went over already before, this is going to be the best investment. Umm. That we could do potentially. That's going to give us, you know, stability, good returns. It's going to be able to generate wealth in the future for long term, you know, sustainability. Diversified, uh, so you know, if one thing happens, it's not going to tank everything. Umm, the bonds and stocks, uh, some of them have inverse relationships based on the correlation. So you're not going to be taking huge losses in the market if something were to happen in one company, uh, or another. Umm, so it just it's a safe and. Stable portfolio that will still give you a good return on your investment. So now we can reflect What surprised you about diversification benefits? Can historical returns and correlations predict future? I think. The biggest thing that surprised me was how much. The risk can be mitigated from a stock if you were to pair it with a bond. Umm. So I think it was, it was in here. So yeah. So because Tesla and the bond have a negative correlation of 0.2, it's basically an inverse relationship. So doing the math here, if you were to do a 5050 split. Umm, it's a 30%. Umm, standard deviation of risk, which is about half of what Tesla's is alone. So by combining Tesla with bonds, uh, it can cut the risk of about half without cutting the returns proportionally. So I, I found that very interesting and surprising. Umm, I didn't realize the power that bonds hold when diversifying and limiting, you know, those large losses and, and, and being able to. You know. Cut the volatility of a stock in half. Umm, it's it's very, very important to know, especially when you know creating a portfolio to invest in. Uh, so can you build a portfolio that beats S and PS500 return? We talked about this earlier, umm. But yeah, I mean, even if you did. Uh, AT252550 split with Tesla, Apple and then 50% bonds. Expected returns about 15%. With a 13% risk. So even that alone beats the S&P 500. Uh, but if you were to look at the recommended umm. Investment over here on the left and that that definitely does beat the S&P 500. So optimal mix, I think we should done that before and then we docked about free lunches. Well, so we answered all the questions there. Umm, can historical returns and correlations predict the future? I think, uh, short answer is yes and no. Umm, you can't only take into, into account historical returns and correlations. You also need to take in, you know, the real world economics and, uh, what's actually going on within the world. And politics, I think that's one of the biggest, uh. Factors. Umm, especially with, you know, a company like Tesla, uh, and their CEO Elon Musk and you know, he's been in the news a lot recently, you know, a lot of press, umm, which can be good or bad. Uh, you know, it gets people looking at the company, but maybe not in the best reasons. So you know that it's it's risky. So you can't really. Can't really correlate that with another, you know? Company, or like Johnson and Johnson, they had the Tylenol scandal. You know that stock is gonna completely drop off umm, and that correlation is all gonna be kind of screwed up. So you can't really take into account that for all of it. Umm definitely can be a factor in predicting, umm, what you want to do, but it can't be the only thing. Umm, yeah, I think that's gonna wrap it up. So yeah, I mean, we went through everything. Our recommendation right there and why, how it beats the S&P 500. Umm. And then we reflected on it. I showed you the code here, 2 separate codes, one of them creates the graph, the other one gave us our output of the optimal portfolio results. We compared those results to what we already had. Umm created the graph to show you know what we can expect to return. Umm. But yeah, I think that's gonna wrap it up. Thanks for listening.

Hi, today we're going to be doing port
0:06
portfolio risk and return analysis.
0:10
So, in this scenario, you just started
0:12
your first job and want to invest
0:14
$10,000
0:16
from your signing bonus. Your colleague
0:19
suggests going all in on Tesla because
0:21
it's the future. Your parents stay to
0:23
stick with an S&P 500 index fund. You
0:27
want to build your own portfolio.
0:31
So the available investments
0:34
are Tesla, Apple, Johnson and Johnson,
0:38
Exxon,
0:40
a bond or the S&P 500 index fund. And as
0:45
you can see here, we have the returns
0:48
and the standard deviation.
0:52
We also have the key correlations Tesla
0:55
and Apple, Johnson and Johnson and
0:57
Exxon, Tesla, Johnson, and then stocks
1:01
and bonds.
1:02
Our questions we want to explore is what
1:05
happens when to risk when you combine
1:07
Tesla with bonds? Can you build a
1:10
portfolio that beats the S&P 500s with
1:13
return with less risk? What's the
1:16
optimal mix for someone your age? How
1:19
does correlation create the free lunch
1:21
of diversification?
1:24
So we are going to go through the steps
1:28
of the driver framework.
1:30
The first thing we're going to start
1:32
with is define and discover. The
1:35
question we want to the questions we
1:37
want to think about is what's your
1:39
investment goal and what risks concern
1:41
you most.
1:43
So the variables we have from this
1:45
scenario is the expected returns, the
1:48
standard deviation which is our risk
1:50
correlations and the be benchmark S&P
1:54
500 index fund. What we want to do is to
1:57
be build a custom portfolio of
2:00
investments
2:01
aka combinations that justify its
2:04
existence by performing better than the
2:07
S&P 500 index fund.
2:11
So the next thing we can think about is
2:13
our concerns and risks.
2:17
From looking at the correlations,
2:21
we can see that
2:25
Apple and Tesla
2:27
are positively positively correlated at
2:30
0.65%.
2:33
Which means they're highly similar. um
2:36
they offer some diversification but
2:39
their returns are highly linked. This
2:42
means that these two stocks move
2:46
together.
2:47
For Johnson and Johnson and Exxon,
2:50
there's 0.3.
2:52
So they also move together,
2:55
but they're pretty similar. So there's a
2:58
bit of diversification potential. for
3:01
Tesla and Johnson and Johnson it is
3:03
negative0.1
3:06
which is very good um there's strong
3:10
diversification there um
3:13
and they move in opposite directions
3:16
when it comes to stocks and bonds um
3:21
that is a good investment and the core
3:24
of diversification
3:26
bonds are crucial for risk reduction
3:29
because it historically goes goes up
3:31
when the market goes down and vice
3:33
versa. So, it could be a good idea to
3:36
invest in a mixture of stocks and bonds
3:38
and not put all your money into one kind
3:42
of asset. This is the value of
3:44
diversification and this is going to be
3:46
our main point that we're going to focus
3:48
in on today.
3:51
So, our investment goal is going to be
3:54
to find the maximum sharp ratio
3:56
portfolio using our six available
3:58
assets. We're constrained by a $10,000
4:01
budget and we need to compare those
4:03
results to the S&P 500 benchmark.
4:07
The negative correlations such as Tesla
4:10
and Johnson and Johnson and stocks and
4:12
bonds present a significant opportunity
4:15
to beat the S&P 500's return with less
4:18
risk.
4:20
Now, you may be wondering what is the
4:22
sharp ratio? It is a simple way to
4:24
measure how good an investment is. It
4:26
tells you how much reward, aka the
4:29
return, you're getting for each risk
4:31
that you're taking.
4:33
So, the things that we're going to want
4:35
to compare is obviously to the S&P 500
4:39
benchmark. We're comparing two different
4:41
rate uh sharp ratios.
4:45
We want to take a look at the two asset
4:47
combinations, Tesla and bonds. And we're
4:50
going to be thinking about those
4:51
negative correlations that I just
4:53
described. Our goal is to calculate a
4:56
portfolio
4:58
expected return and standard deviation
5:01
for various Tesla and bond mixes such as
5:05
80 and 20, 50 and 50, 20 and 80. And
5:10
then we are going to be doing multiasset
5:13
optimization.
5:15
We're going to be using a numerical
5:16
solver to find optimal weights across
5:19
six assets that maximize the overall
5:22
portfolio sharp ratio.
5:24
And we're thinking about the optimal mis
5:27
mix as a young investor and um what kind
5:31
of risk tolerance that they may may be
5:33
willing to take.
5:36
So now that we've thoroughly thought
5:38
through the scenario, we can move on to
5:40
the represent stage.
5:42
We want to visualize the returns, the
5:45
risk and correlations for optimizing.
5:48
Our first stage is ob obviously data
5:51
acquisition. We're going to be
5:52
collecting all of those variables.
5:56
The next stage is risk analysis. We're
5:59
going to need the daily returns, the
6:01
risk. We're going to need to annualize
6:03
it and we're going to calculate a
6:05
coariance matrix.
6:08
This output is going to be our risk
6:09
measures and the diversification
6:11
potential. The next stage is portfolio
6:14
optimization.
6:16
We are going to we have all of our asset
6:19
statistics and we're going to test
6:21
different combinations of them.
6:24
That is going to be our portfolio. The
6:26
different combinations.
6:28
We're going to calculate the sharp risk.
6:31
Find the one that has the most optimal
6:34
optimal ratio based on different
6:37
combinations.
6:40
The next stage is going to be validation
6:42
and comparison.
6:44
We're going to compare the optimal
6:46
portfolio that we've created, compare it
6:48
to the bench benchmark and make sure
6:51
that it's greater than the benchmark.
6:56
Something I want to explain is the is
6:59
the efficient frontier concept.
7:02
So this is a graph that plots the
7:05
individ individual assets on a risk
7:08
return plane.
7:11
So, our main goal here is to find a
7:15
combination of these points, aka the
7:17
portfolio, that plots it above and to
7:20
the left of the S&P 500 benchmark that
7:23
has 18% risk and 12% return, proving
7:28
that the customized portfolio is
7:30
superior.
7:33
So you can think of all the different
7:34
combinations that we're finding as
7:37
different points on a graph and we're
7:39
looking for the one that is going to
7:41
provide us with the most return and
7:44
least amount of risk and comparing it to
7:46
the benchmark.
7:49
So now we can move on to the
7:50
implementation stage.
7:54
So we have all of our assets
7:56
and we can create a correlation matrix.
8:02
We also have our information from the
8:04
benchmark
8:06
and we can create a coariance matrix.
8:11
After that we can calculate the
8:14
portfolio return the risk and a sharp
8:17
the sharp ratio.
8:22
After that, we can move on to the
8:24
portfolio optimization stage. We're
8:27
going to find the value that has the
8:29
most optimal sharp ratio.
8:32
And um the higher the sharp ratio equals
8:37
the better risk adjusted performance.
8:42
So we have our constraints, our bounds,
8:45
and then um this solver is going to
8:50
extract the results.
8:55
So here we're just printing all of our
8:57
data
9:04
and now we can move on to the outputs.
9:09
So we have our returns
9:13
and we have our risk.
9:18
Here is our correlation matrix.
9:22
And if you notice
9:25
before,
9:28
Johnson and Johnson and Tesla have a
9:31
negative.1.
9:34
So there's good uh diversification
9:36
potential and then obviously the Tesla
9:40
and the bond have a 0.2 uh correlation
9:45
which is also good but with Apple and
9:49
Exxon it's 0.5
9:51
meaning they're very similar.
9:57
So when we calculated the S&P 500 sharp
10:01
ratio that came out to be 0.5
10:05
and our solver calculated
10:08
um the optimal port portfolio weights
10:12
and Johnson and Johnson and Bond
10:17
got the greatest amount of allocation
10:22
and the reason for that is because those
10:25
are going to be our safest
10:27
investments.
10:30
And in this scenario, our portfolio
10:33
sharp ratio turned out to be greater
10:37
than the S&P 500.
10:41
Since it's greater, this is a success.
10:45
Um, the diversified portfolio beats the
10:48
S&P 500 benchmark and offers a 0.244
10:52
increase in risk adjusted performance.
10:59
So now that we've had a success in
11:01
creating an a solver that finds the
11:05
optimal portfolio for a young investor,
11:08
we can begin to validate our our
11:11
conclusions and our calculations.
11:15
So here we can just intuitively calc uh
11:18
compare the uh the portfolio's
11:22
uh return
11:24
um to the benchmark. We can compare the
11:27
risk to the benchmark and the sharp
11:29
ratio and we can just see what those
11:31
differences are.
11:34
Obviously everything looks good. We want
11:37
it to be lower. We want the um
11:43
expected risk to be lower and the sharp
11:46
ratio to be greater.
11:48
Um we can it's important to check our
11:51
mathematical correctness. Make sure the
11:53
sum of weights equals 100%. Make sure
11:56
we're using all of that $10,000.
11:59
Um correlation matrix looked okay. and
12:02
then we can calculate the sharp ratios
12:04
by hand to just make sure that those
12:06
values came out okay.
12:12
So, as I kind of mentioned before, um
12:16
our greatest allocations go towards
12:19
bonds and Johnson and Johnson. Um just
12:22
because obviously bond is the lowest
12:26
risk asset and has a negative
12:29
correlation with stocks and then Johnson
12:31
Johnson is a defensive stock with high
12:34
efficiency. So it forms the low risk
12:37
stock foundation of the portfolio
12:39
contributing to stability and higher
12:41
return than bond without excessive risk.
12:46
And then if you notice Exxon was
12:49
excluded. Um this is because that it's
12:54
efficient just compared to the other
12:56
assets and it just kind of um shook out
13:00
that way.
13:03
Um here you can kind of see that I've
13:06
worked through um a logic and compared
13:09
the different um values and then I also
13:13
created a validation tree. And as I said
13:16
before,
13:18
we want to make sure that sharp ratio
13:20
for optimum portfolio is greater than
13:23
the sharp ratio for the S&P 500.
13:29
So the next stage is going to be to
13:32
evolve. How does changing the mi mix of
13:35
uh the mix affect risk and return.
13:40
So to to call back to what I said to
13:43
before the optimal portfolio is just one
13:46
point on the efficient frontier which
13:49
represents the best possible return for
13:51
every level of risk for that scenario
13:54
that we're looking at. So,
13:58
if you want to seek a higher return, um,
14:03
you're going to need to invest in more
14:05
high return, high-risk assets such as
14:07
Tesla and Apple and reduce your
14:10
investment into bonds. If you want to uh
14:14
reduce your risk, you're going to put
14:17
more of your money into the bonds and
14:19
reduce those high risks. kind of just
14:21
depends on what the investor is looking
14:25
to do.
14:28
And then
14:30
an important thing to think about is
14:32
that um
14:35
over time prices will change and cause
14:40
these weights to drift. And the key
14:42
thing to to focus on is that you're
14:46
going to need to rebalance and capture
14:48
those diversification benefits benefits
14:51
over time. And then again depending on
14:55
the scenario and who the investor is the
14:58
constraints can change. Um real
15:01
portfolios have practical constraints
15:03
beyond just pure optimization.
15:06
So there may be certain different
15:09
circumstances
15:12
and then again different investors care
15:16
about different dimensions of risk.
15:19
Finally we can move on to the reflection
15:22
stage. Um
15:24
the questions we want to think about is
15:26
what surprised you about diver
15:28
diversification benefits and can the
15:31
historical returns and correlations
15:33
predict the future?
15:35
So,
15:37
one of the things I want to talk about
15:39
is that I hope that I've driven this
15:42
home. Diversification is quantifiable
15:44
and powerful.
15:47
The key to reducing risk is
15:50
diversification.
15:53
So, there's no magic formula to getting
15:56
higher returns without accepting risk.
15:59
And we are just using the efficient
16:02
frontier to show the best possible
16:05
combination.
16:06
Um and in that way we use the sharp
16:09
ratio as a critical tool to identify the
16:12
best risk adjusted portfolios proving
16:15
that professional investing is
16:18
optimization and not simple stock
16:20
picking.
16:22
And then again bonds are very powerful.
16:26
It's that free lunch. Um, it may be
16:30
counterintuitive to put all your money
16:31
into a bond or a large sum of it at
16:34
least, especially when Tesla offers a
16:37
35% return, but you have to focus on
16:40
that risk
16:43
and it acts as a shock absor absorber
16:46
for stocks like Tesla.
16:50
And then
16:51
another question to think about is can
16:54
historical returns and correlations
16:56
predict the future?
16:59
This is the biggest limitation of the
17:01
modern portfolio theory and
17:03
unfortunately no historical inputs
17:05
cannot guarantee future results. But the
17:10
modern portfolio uh theory can be very
17:13
helpful.
17:16
You know, it's as close as we can get to
17:17
trying to predict uh predict the future.
17:20
It implicitly
17:22
implicitly assumes that statistics are
17:25
relatively stable over time. In reality,
17:28
that's just not the way the world works.
17:31
Um, and then real historical data has
17:35
limitation and past performance doesn't
17:38
always guarantee future results. So if
17:41
you find yourself creating a calculation
17:44
like this and it not shaking out the way
17:47
you cope, sometimes the future is just
17:51
unpredictable.
17:52
Um there is real world complexity and
17:56
market regimes change and then portfolio
18:01
professional portfolio man management is
18:03
systematic. you need to be constantly
18:05
monitoring, monitoring and
18:09
taking a look at what the changes are.
18:13
So the true value of this analysis is
18:16
not this sharp ratio that we calculated,
18:19
but it's understanding why that specific
18:21
mix of assets achieved the best possible
18:24
performance under our initial
18:26
assumptions and the scenario.
18:31
Thank you."
37271356,colon34,Galiena,Colon,"Hi. So, today we're doing sess session
six and our mission is to is that we
started our first job and want to invest
your $10,000 signing bonus. Your
colleague suggest going all in on Tesla
because it's the future, but your
parents say to stick with the 500. So,
we're going to build our own portfolio
today and see what is going to be the
best one for us.
So, we were given this information about
each of the assets or stocks that we
could invest in and we have a benchmark
here, the S&P 500. And then we have the
correlations we were also given and then
some questions to explore that um I'll
get to answering at the end.
So, we're going to be using the driver
framework today. Defineing discovery is
the first step. I just wanted to lay out
a few things for us. Um, I wanted to
define the investment objective.
Basically, since we're young, our
primary goal is going to be long-term
capital appreciation. We want to grow
our money and gain more money. Our time
horizon is going to be 10 plus years
because we're young. We want to invest
for a good amount of time. Our return
target is going to be to beat inflation
and we want a reasonable return,
um, a nominal 8 to 12%. our risk
tolerance. We can handle some risk
because we're going to be investing
longterm. And then we wanted to identify
our available assets. They've already
done that for us. We have some growth
stocks. We have some defensive stock,
the lower risk stock. We have cyclical
stock, fixed income, which is a bond,
and then the benchmark, which is going
to be the SPY.
To determine analysis period, it's going
to be 5 years. Select key metrics. We're
going to be looking at the returns
today. The volatility or the risk, the
sharp ratio ratio, which is the risk
adjusted return, that's the return minus
the risk-free return divided by the
volatility or the risk. And then
correlations, we want to pair wise
relationships between the assets for
that diversification potential. And then
I wanted to establish constraints. I
want non- negative. I wanted to have a
non- neg negative constraint where
there's no short selling. I wanted to
have a sum to one constraint where we're
using all of our $10,000 and then a
maximum individual asset asset cap. I
wanted some caps for some of the assets
like high volatility assets I wanted to
be greater than equal to 20. Some of the
other ones I wanted to be the weight to
be sorry I wanted the weight to be less
than or equal to 20. For some of the
other ones I wanted it to be less than
equal to 40. And then for the bond I
wanted it to be less than equal to 20.
Now I was using Gemini to come up with
these um in order to create what might
be the best portfolio. And we wouldn't
want um too much high volatility assets
to take over.
So, what's our investment goal? Again, I
said long-term capital appreciation. We
want more money. We want to preser We
want capital preservation
um relative to inflation. So, we want to
make sure we still have some purchasing
power at the end. And then what risk
concern you most? I just wanted to
outline a couple risks um that there are
when investing. We have systematic risk,
which is the market risk. the primary
risk that we accept. Um, with long-term
investing, we have time to recover from
market crashes. So, volatility is our
friend right now because we're investing
over a long period of time.
And it allows us to buy more cheap um
buy more shares cheaply during the
downturns. And the then we have
idiosyncratic risk, which is the stock
specific risk. Um, the risk this is the
risk that we're going to try to
minimize. This is the danger um of one
company like Tesla going bankrupt. So,
we can eliminate this risk by
diversifying our portfolio. Well, we
don't want to put all of our um eggs in
one basket. And then with us investing
long-term, it supports taking on maximum
systematic risk while minimizing the
unsistatic risk.
So again, we can get rid of the
unsistatic risk by diversifying our
portfolio.
onto the represent. We want to visualize
our returns, volatility, and
correlations before optimizing. So here
I
use Gemini to create a graph of the
returns and the risks. So you can see
that Tesla is all the way up here and
then we have the bond all the way down
here. And then I created a correlation
matrix with the ones that we were given.
And then another note is that this graph
does not have the efficient frontier
because that would involve calculating
the risk and expected return for
thousands of different combinations. So
we can get into that um when we go to
the implement stage.
So onto the implement stage.
We have this graph here, but I'll get to
that in a second. Let's go through the
code first.
So here is the code.
At the beginning they outline what
assets we have available to us. The fact
that the risk-f free rate is 0 point is
3%. They give us our expected returns
for our assets, our standard deviations
or the risk or the volatility for our
assets and then they show us the
correlation matrix and they fill this in
with some assumptions because we didn't
have all all the data that we needed
here. They outline the core portfolio
functions we have. They're going to be
looking at the return of the portfolio,
the volatility of the portfolio, and
they're going to be calculating the
sharp ratio, which you can see the
equation here.
And then onto the constraints and
optimization setup. We want to minimize
the negative sharp ratio. And then the
constraints they outline here. Number
one is the sum to one constraint where
we want to be using all of our we want
the weights to be equal to 100%.
And then the asset class range
constraint um we're going to max out the
bond um to be 20%. You can go so it's
not going to go above 20% for the bond.
And then here it's just listing the
constraints. And then we have a non-
negativity constraint
meaning um none of the assets can be
negative or like we want them to all be
at least have some weight.
So you can see that they outline that
here Tesla 20 and so on. And then it's
going to run the optimization and it's
analyzing here
um some of those calculations
and then then it's going to be comparing
to our benchmark the spy and then here's
our output. They give us the weight for
each of them, each of the assets. And
then the portfolio expected return is
14.15%.
The volatility or the risk is 14.47%
and then the sharp ratio they found to
be 0.77.
And so the goal for this run was to beat
the return of the SPY or the benchmark
that we were given. So that that would
be beating 12% and then trying to get a
lower risk than 18%.
And so they were able to do this
basically saying that the sharp ratio is
better than the spy, the historical one
we were given for the spy
and they said that the optimization
delivered the ideal outcome for the
young investors 10-year horizon. The
growth engine was from the high
allocation into those high return stocks
like Apple and Tesla. And then the
defensive diversifier
um using bonds and the J&J stock um
really helped us to lower our risk while
also investing into those higher risk
bonds.
So the bond provides the necessary
negative correlation. So not putting all
of our eggs into one basket and the
correlation, the negative correlation
helped us. So maybe when
Apple or one of those other high um
return stocks might be going down, the
bond would still be making us money
because it has negative correlation. And
then it says this hedging effect
dramatically reduces the overall po
portfolio volatility or the risk
allowing the high-risk high return
stocks to dominate the return profile
without breaking the risk budget.
So back to the implement
here is a graph um that I asked
Python to make for the efficient
frontier.
This curve shows the best portfolios at
certain returns and certain
volatilities. Uh the curve demonstrates
the key principle of the risk and return
trade-off. If you want a higher expected
return, you have to take on more risk.
So as you can see, as you go up, you're
taking on more risk.
Moving on, I just wanted to outline a
few things just to for people to
understand the code better. So basically
what it was doing was it was testing out
different weight combinations and then
looking at the portfolio return for that
combination, looking at the risk and
then calculating a sharp ratio in order
to find which one was the best one. And
then a little bit about beta. I did not
calculate it in my Python but just to
touch on it a little bit. It quantifies
the systematic risk like we were talking
earlier that market risk of an
investment or it can do a portfolio
relative to the overall market. So
basically we're seeing how sensitive an
assets price is to broad market
movements. So a portfolio with higher
weight with a higher weight of stocks
that's riskier means it's going to have
a higher beta but it's which means it's
higher risk but you could get a higher
reward. stocks have a higher beta than
bonds and
defensive stocks because those bonds and
defensive stocks are
less risky and
more stable when the market might be
going up and down. And then onto
portfolio diversification. A well well
diversified portfolio that adds assets
with low correlation can maintain
returns while lowering portfolio
volatility which increases the sharp
ratio. And we saw this um with my code.
We invested into bonds but also those
stocks that had a lower risk. And this
definitely helped with our portfolio
diversification
especially with investing in those high
risk stocks like Apple and Tesla. And
then the sharp ratio I just wanted to
outline. Um again here's the equation.
So a higher sharp ratio is means that
we're generating more return for each
unit of risk taken. So the optimal
portfolio for anyone is different based
on their constraints and their personal
goals. In our case we're able to take on
a little bit more risk because we are
investing over a longer period of time.
On to validate. Compare your portfolio
metrics with benchmarks like the S&P
500. So here's a little screenshot of
the output of the portfolio that we
created in Python and using the numbers
that we were given from the book. The
S&P 500 had a risk of 18, an annual
average return of 12% and a sharp ratio
of 0.5. So we definitely were able to
beat this because our sharp ratio is
higher which means we have more are
getting more return per unit of risk
that we're taking on. But with real data
out there I looked it up the risk after
5 years for the S&P 500 was 16% annual
return was 16.36 and the average in the
sharp ratio was um 0.89. So they are
able to get more return for each unit of
risk they took on. So we did beat the
historical numbers that we were given.
So on to evolve. How does changing the
mix affect the risk and return? First,
less weight for high risk and return
assets means we're going to have less
risk in return. more weight for high
risk and return assets would mean more
risk and return that we are taking on.
So this just shows the risk and return
trade-off. So to achieve a higher
expected return, you must accept the
fact that you're going to be getting a
higher level of risk. And then the
diversification principle basically
means that combining assets with
different risk patterns can reduce total
portfolio risk without sacrificing the
expected return. So just to see this
risk tradeoff um come into play, I
actually created three portfolios using
Python. We have I created one with
minimum volatility, the maximum sharp
ratio and the maximum return. So you can
see for the minimum volatility where we
don't invest in these high risk and
return stocks that our return and our
risk is lower.
But when we do invest in them a little
more as you can see the maximum return
portfolio we have a lot more risk a lot
more return but also it comes with a lot
more risk.
So on to reflect what surprised you
about the diversification benefits? The
main shock I had was how you can reduce
your risk without having to reduce your
expected return. And then it was cool to
see that when you combine assets with
low correlation, you're essentially
canceling out the ups and downs that may
happen over time with and this reduces
the portfolio's volatility or the risk.
And then can historical returns and
correlations predict the future? No,
they can't reliably predict the future,
but they can give us a good estimate.
But again, those estimates are never
guarantees.
So, questions to explore. Let's answer
those. What happens to risk when you
combine Tesla with bonds? So, Tesla on
its own is a very risky stock to invest
in. But when you combine the two
portfolios, the risk drops because Tesla
and bonds are not perfectly correlated.
They're actually I think it was
negative0.2
correlation. So if Tesla is doing bad
then we're still making some return off
of the bonds.
And then can you build a portfolio that
beats the S&P's 500 return with less
risk? Yes, we did it with the
hypothetical historical data and we saw
that
my portfolio had a better sharp ratio
than the S&P 500. How does correlation
create the free lunch of
diversification? It's free lunch because
by using the correlation to offset the
ups and downs of your assets, you are
able to lower the portfolio risk without
lowering its expected return.
So on to what's the optimal mix for
someone your age. Out of the three
portfolio options I have created, the
second one is the best because it has
the best sharp ratio and which means
it's the best balance of risk for the
return for risk taken. And just to look
at those one more time, um we have the
minimum volatility which was a 0.69
sharp ratio. We had the max ratio max
sharp ratio portfolio that had 0.77 and
then we had the maximum return that had
a sharp ratio of 0.75.
So the second one was the best option
because that sharp ratio was the
highest.
And then we can be a little bit more
aggressive with the amount of risk that
we take on because we are younger and
we're going to be investing over time.
So we don't necessarily need to go for
minimum volatility.
But by choosing the second option with a
little bit more risk taken, we're still
taking on a good amount of risk, but
it's not near as much as that 20% that
the maximum return one is taking on.
But with taking on
a good amount of risk, you are also
getting a respectable return. And you
can see this by subtracting your return
from the second option portfolio minus
the inflation. This is the real return
that you're getting and you can see that
inflation won't affect your purchasing
power. So, thank you."
37379655,franc103,Leon,Francis,"Here is my assignment uh section six section six assignment response. So for today our mission is the given scenario. So our we have just started our first job and want to invest $10,000 of our signing bonus. And while our colleague suggests going all in on Tesla, our parents say to stick with an S&P 500 index fund and we want to build our own portfolio. Now here is some of the possible assets that we can invest into and their respective average returns and standard deviations and these are two important components of or aspects of a stock because they provide to us the average return and the associated risk with them uh as standard deviation is a measure of risk. Additionally, we have the correlations between each of the different assets. And what this does is it's essentially a measure which is telling us how if there is a strong correlation, a strong positive one, they both increase together at the same period or same time and have a similar growth trend. So for example, with 0.65, it's a correlation. Tesla and Apple both grow or increase in value. um stocks increase in value at the same period. So let's start off. Uh here is my define and discover stage. So our goal is to evaluate the the different investment strategies for portfolio optimization. So our key information we just looked at it in the textbook and these questions I'll be looking at uh answering them towards the end of the video. So here's the represent stage. So what this does it basically uh oh yeah just a disclaimer I'm actually going to be using the real life data or real uh historical data for this analysis rather than using the given values in the textbook just to make this analysis a bit more um clear and a bit more accurate. So here are uh the import Yahoo Finance as we want to look at real time values. We have the respective uh tickers for which assets and bonds we are considering. So we to to calculate the annualized returns we take the monthly returns from the Yahoo finance data then we times it by 12 to get the uh or we times the mean of the monthly returns by 12 to get the analyzed returns. The same thing for the standard deviations which is a measurement of uh risk associated with stocks. So if you run the code, we see the historical data from the past 5 years which we've received from Yahoo Finance and the calculations that we did in the code. So we have each of the tickers and their associated annual returns and risk uh for the six different options that we had. We also have the uh asset correlation matrix and I'll get back to it in a bit get back to this in a bit. So first off, let's look at the table that the code or the graph that the code made. So it's a graph for the real risk versus return over the f past 5 years. And what this does is essentially um put up annualized average return against annualized standard deviations. So risk of the different uh assets that we have. So we have Tesla which has really high risk but also high average return whereas the rest of the options have pretty low analyzed uh standard deviation and varying uh analyze average returns. Here is the real asset correlation matrix. So as I said this is a matrix to show the growth trend between the different assets in question. So with a val correlation of one, it's a perfect correlation. So they increase the same and that's only possible in this case for all when the assets are the same. uh but we also see a wide variety of um correlations which just show whether there's a high chance or there's a clear trend that when one uh asset value increases the other will also increase or when one increases the other will never increase. So those type of things this provides us a great um platform to use in the and I'll get into this in a in in the coming few sections. Now let us get into the implement stage. The implement stage is where we'll be looking at the uh whether it is whether it makes sense to use one of these options. So, put everything on Tesla or put everything in S&P 500 index fund or use a random or personalized um portfolio split to get the best out of the returns and risk. So, here's the code for that we'll be using for analysis. We know the risk-free rate is um 3% while the correlation matrix we looked at from before and it's the same um assets in question and here are just the three equations I would like to focus on. So the first one is to calculate the expected return of a portfolio and this is done by taking the sum of each of the weight of the assets and then just multiplying that by the return return of the respective asset and then taking the sum of that. It's a pretty simple uh formula, but it allows us to especi essentially give a value to portfolio because we're essentially measuring how much the portfolio can actually give to us over time. The second equation I would like to focus on is the um standard deviation calculation which is the total risk associated with the portfolio. So what this does is basically uh similar to the expected return uh for a portfolio this equation gives the portfolio a associated risk. So what this does is it takes the weights and ju here it's not as clear but when you go to Gemini and ask it to explain what is actually going on we're actually just taking the um weighted contribution to portfolio based on every single B uh as asset or bond and then just adding it up with the uh coarian component. So what this does allows us to basically project or display the total risk associated with the portfolio and have it as a measurable val value for uh analysis purposes. And the final uh equation I would like to look on is the sharp ratio. This is really important because this is what allows us to calculate the risk adjusted return and it measures the excess return that we get above the free the risk-free rate per unit of risk. So allows us to just have a um indication into how good the asset is in terms of the risk it is associated with. So here's the different weights that we have. So um

let me just let me just make sure I have the So we had Oh yeah. So these are just the weights that we have. Uh so for the first scenario we had um putting everything into uh the Tesla one. For the second one, we had putting everything into um the S&P uh 500 index one. And let me just make sure I have the right values. Sorry for that. And 1025. Yep. Sorry for that. Um yeah, so let me just run the code. It's a pretty simple output but it gives us a lot of information to process. So we have the portfolio comparison right. So we have the colleague um point of view the parents point of view the for the colleague or 100% in Tesla we have a portfolio return of pretty high 50%. But we also have the highest risk associated. Therefore the sharp ratio is 0.72. For the parents's recommendation, we have 14% for portfolio return while a risk of 18%. And the custom portfolio or the sharp value is lower than the Tesla actually whereas the sharp uh or the custom portfolio split that we defined here and this was actually given straight to us by the code we actually get an 18% portfolio return whereas a risk of 20%. However, we get a really good sharp ratio which is actually higher than putting everything in Tesla. And the reason for this is actually associated with the free lunch divers diversification uh theory. So what that means is rather than putting every all of your investment in one asset EQ, diversify your ass uh investments into different assets. Now why this makes sense is actually if you go back to the correlation matrix by putting uh our investments in different assets it allows us to leverage the different correlations between the assets. So for example if we put everything on Tesla and for wait for for example if we only put uh everything on Tesla and everything in bonds. So, make sure this was bonds. So, 0.5.

Let me just make sure those that was the actual bond. Yep. Yep. So, half in Tesla, half in bond. What do we see? We actually see a pretty good return on 24%. But our risk is a bit high. So, our sharp ratio doesn't it's not as competitive as it was before of 0.78. So what does this exactly mean? So by by basically diversifying we're we're allowing the chances of have of us having a stable return to be higher because for if one of the assets doesn't perform as well, we have other assets that can bounce up and keep performing and vice versa. So what this does, it allows us to have a stable platform to depend on for returns as we have assets that grow in different uh trends. And by having those different trends or correlations, what this does it it basically balances out the uh variations or differences in the um the returns over the years. So that just goes to show how optimizing a such a optimizing our portfolio is so important. So to validate we just as we said um that was part of I just went through the validate stage. So the validate and the implement stage are kind of mixed up. But just to go through those different um options of just putting different um splits of portfolios. So if you put everything in the bond, it doesn't it's not great because we know the bond is the lowest of the average return with the lowest of uh risk. So it's perfectly makes sense to have a low risk but it's not great for the sharp ratio. So to evolve um I'll be using the efficient frontier to identify the most optimal portfolio split. So just for time sake um we have again the risk-free rates and what this code is going to actually do is we have again the equations but the main purpose of this code is run quite a few iterations. So almost 20,000 iterations of using different splits for portfolios and find out the best uh or maximum um the maximum and so the the maximum or best uh portfolio and the lowest portfolio. So the best and worst are based on the sharp ratios and the higher the sharp ratio the better. So if you run this code um

there we go. So we've been given the max sharp ratio portfolio and it gives us a return of 29% while a risk of 30% and a sharp ratio of 0.88. So these are the associated weights that would actually give us this uh return and risk. And this is great because we have a high sharp ratio. And the the worst split that we could do with the uh investment we have or investment capacity we have is uh presented here and it would give us a lowest sharp ratio value of 0.36. So here is a graph of the efficient frontier as this is a great way to identify what the optimal split would be for a portfolio and the star is here even though there are possible higher sharp ratios because uh yeah the star is here because it provides the highest sharp ratio and these are actually individual values of average return against standard deviation. So it must not be mistaken for sharp ratio values. Therefore, we come to our reflect stage. Um, and there are some there's a few questions I would like to go through from the start. And one of the things it's it's really helpful to diversify our portfolio and to optimize it because it just allows us to have a sense of balance and stab stability when it comes to having a uh constant flow return. And understanding the correlation was very important because I always start by having a high correlation is the best for portfolios. But it makes sense to have uh combinations of high and low because you kind of balancing out or leveling the fluctuations in um returns by having higher um just different correlations or lower correlations between the assets. And that just allows you to level things out. In terms of the disadvantages and advantages of of using historical data, it's great to have uh historical data to base our analysis on as it provides us with a stable platform to actually have accurate and real life analysis. But the disadvantage would be actually the the past five years because it's not been the the most stable five years with the co 19 pandemic and other fluctuations in the financial market. So even though it's not been the most stable and it might not provide the best or most optimal uh platform or foundation for us to use our use for our analysis, it still gives us a pretty good um way to build upon our analysis and yep. So in terms of the optimal u portfolio split for our someone with our age I would say it the main focus of the split should be maximizing the return. So even though you would say uh we should go for the max sharp ratio portfolio because it gives us the best return, it also has a 30% risk. And in terms of people of my age putting investment in, it would make sense to have a pretty low risk uh associated with the investment because we want to leverage on that investment for quite a few years into the future as we build our careers. So it makes sense to have a steady form of return with low risk associated with it and when it would make sense to have take more risks in the future when you have more um assets to liquidate or have more income to spend. But in my perspective it makes sense to have a even though it might be a lower return having that sense of certainty that the returns would be constant and not fluctuate as much would make sense. So overall it was a great experience to look into how you know sharp ratios, annual returns and standard deviations matter so much in optimizing a portfolio. Thank you."
