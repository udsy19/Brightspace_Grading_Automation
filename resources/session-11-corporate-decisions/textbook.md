# Session 11: Corporate Decisions and Incentives

*Debt vs. Equity: How should a company pay for its growth?*

---

## Section 1: The Financial Hook - The Expansion Dilemma

Tesla needs \$5 billion to fund European gigafactory expansion. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn presents three financing options to the board:

**Option A: Pure Equity**
- Issue 15 million new shares at \$333 each
- Dilutes existing shareholders by 5%
- No debt service burden, maintains financial flexibility

**Option B: Pure Debt**  
- Issue \$5B in corporate bonds at 4.5% interest
- \$225M annual interest payments for 10 years
- Leverages returns but increases bankruptcy risk

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- \$2.5B equity + \$2.5B debt combination
- Balanced approach with moderate leverage

**Timeline Visualization:**
```
Financing Decision -----> Capital Investment -----> Future Cash Flows -----> Value Impact
Today                    Build factory          Years 1-20              Shareholders

Option A: Equity -----> Lower risk -----> Lower returns -----> Less volatility
Option B: Debt -----> Higher risk -----> Higher returns -----> More volatility  
Option C: Mixed -----> Medium risk -----> Medium returns -----> Balanced profile
```

Each choice creates different incentives for management, shareholders, and bondholders. Your Sessions 1-9 tools can value the projects, but how do financing decisions affect who benefits and who bears the risk?

This session examines how capital structure creates conflicts of interest and shapes corporate behavior—the final piece in understanding how businesses optimize both investment and financing decisions.

## Section 2: Foundational Concepts & Formulas

### Part I: Capital Structure and Agency Theory

**Agency Problem:** Conflicts arise when managers, shareholders, and bondholders have different objectives, creating suboptimal decision-making without proper incentive alignment.

**Key Stakeholder Conflicts:**
- **Shareholders vs. Bondholders:** Equity holders prefer risky projects; debt holders prefer safety
- **Managers vs. Shareholders:** Executives may pursue empire building over shareholder value
- **Controlling vs. Minority Shareholders:** Large shareholders may extract private benefits

**Capital Structure Effects:**
- **Financial Leverage:** Amplifies both returns and risks to equity holders
- **Debt Discipline:** Interest obligations force efficient operations
- **Financial Flexibility:** Low debt preserves options for future opportunities

**AI Learning Support - Financial Leverage and Risk Management**

**Learning Goal:** Develop sophisticated understanding of how leverage amplifies returns and risks, and its impact on corporate decision-making.

**📋 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing financial leverage effects and understand that debt amplifies both positive and negative business performance through fixed interest obligations. The mathematical relationship shows how ROE volatility increases with leverage, creating opportunity for higher returns but also higher bankruptcy risk. I want to deepen my professional analysis: How do corporate treasurers determine optimal leverage ratios for their specific business? What stress testing approaches do they use to assess debt capacity? How do they balance growth opportunities with financial stability in volatile industries? What metrics do rating agencies and lenders use to evaluate leverage appropriateness?"*

**📊 Why This Shows Professional Risk Management Skills:**
- ✅ **Leverage mechanics understanding**: Shows mathematical and economic sophistication
- ✅ **Risk-return integration**: Demonstrates comprehensive analytical thinking
- ✅ **Professional application**: Seeks real-world corporate finance practices
- ✅ **External stakeholder awareness**: Shows understanding of rating agency and lender perspectives

**😐 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"How does leverage work and why does it make returns more risky?"*

**💸 Why This Shows Limited Financial Sophistication:**
- ❌ **No mathematical foundation**: Shows zero quantitative understanding
- ❌ **Basic inquiry level**: Cannot handle professional-level analysis
- ❌ **No practical context**: Misses corporate application opportunities
- ❌ **Superficial understanding**: Lacks sophisticated risk analysis capability

**🏆 Your Risk Management Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the quantitative risk analysis and strategic leverage management skills that corporate treasurers and CFOs possess.

### Part II: Leverage and Returns Analysis

**Return on Equity with Leverage:**
$$ROE = \frac{EBIT - Interest}{Equity} = \frac{(ROA \times Assets) - (Interest Rate \times Debt)}{Equity}$$

**Degree of Financial Leverage:**
$$DFL = \frac{EBIT}{EBIT - Interest} = \frac{\% \Delta EPS}{\% \Delta EBIT}$$

**Timeline for Leverage Effects:**
```
Business Performance: EBIT varies -----> Leverage amplifies -----> ROE volatility
                     Market cycles      Fixed debt costs        Shareholder impact

Low Leverage: Stable returns -----> Lower bankruptcy risk -----> Conservative growth
High Leverage: Volatile returns -----> Higher bankruptcy risk -----> Aggressive growth
```

### Part III: Optimal Capital Structure Theory

**Trade-off Theory:** Optimal capital structure balances tax benefits of debt against costs of financial distress.

**Benefits of Debt:**
- **Tax Shield:** Interest payments reduce taxable income
- **Discipline Effect:** Debt payments force efficient operations
- **Lower Cost:** Debt typically costs less than equity

**Costs of Debt:**
- **Financial Distress:** Bankruptcy and reorganization costs
- **Agency Costs:** Conflicts between shareholders and bondholders
- **Reduced Flexibility:** Fixed payments limit strategic options

### Part IV: Integration with Course Framework

**Capital Structure's Role:**
```
Sessions 1-8: Learn to value assets and determine cost of capital
Session 9: Apply NPV framework to investment decisions
Session 10: Understand how financing choices affect value and incentives
Sessions 11-12: Integrate financing and investment analysis
```

**Decision Interdependence:**
```
Investment Decisions: Which projects to undertake (NPV analysis)
                     ↓
Financing Decisions: How to fund chosen projects (capital structure)
                    ↓
Value Creation: Optimal combination maximizes firm value
```

**AI Learning Support - Optimal Capital Structure and Trade-off Theory**

**Learning Goal:** Master the analytical framework for determining optimal capital structure by balancing tax benefits against financial distress costs.

**⚖️ Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing optimal capital structure using trade-off theory and want to understand how professionals determine the right debt-equity mix. My framework considers: (1) tax shield value from interest deductibility, (2) expected costs of financial distress including direct bankruptcy costs and indirect business disruption, (3) agency costs from debt-equity conflicts, (4) loss of financial flexibility. Beyond the theoretical model, how do CFOs practically determine their target capital structure? What industry-specific factors make some sectors more leveraged than others? How do they adjust capital structure over business cycles? What role do credit ratings play in constraining leverage decisions?"*

## Section 3: The Gym - Partner Practice

### Round 1: Solo Practice (10 minutes)

**Problem 1 (Leverage Effects):** Company has \$1M equity, earns \$200K EBIT. Assume equity will be replaced with debt. That is, the company's total assets remain the same at \$1M. Compare ROE under:
a) No debt
b) \$500K debt at 8% interest
c) \$1M debt at 10% interest

**Problem 2 (Agency Conflicts):** High-tech startup with significant debt considers:
- Project A: 90% chance of \$100K profit, 10% chance of \$1M loss
- Project B: 50% chance of \$300K profit, 50% chance of \$200K loss
Which do shareholders prefer? Which do bondholders prefer?

**AI Learning Support - Risk-Taking Incentives and Leverage**

**Learning Goal:** Master how leverage creates asymmetric risk-taking incentives between shareholders and bondholders.

**🎲 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing Problem 2's risk-shifting scenario and see how leverage creates perverse incentives. Shareholders prefer Project B despite higher risk because they capture upside while bondholders bear downside - classic asset substitution. This explains why distressed companies often 'gamble for resurrection.' My question: How do sophisticated lenders anticipate and prevent this behavior? What covenant structures effectively constrain risk-taking without hampering legitimate business flexibility? How do convertible bonds or warrants help align incentives? What monitoring mechanisms do creditors employ?"*

**🔍 Why This Shows Professional Credit Analysis:**
- ✅ **Deep incentive understanding**: Recognizes asset substitution dynamics
- ✅ **Practical solutions focus**: Seeks real covenant structures
- ✅ **Hybrid instrument awareness**: Knows convertibles align incentives
- ✅ **Monitoring sophistication**: Understands ongoing creditor oversight

**🎰 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"Why would shareholders pick the riskier project? That seems wrong."*

**💭 Why This Shows Naive Financial Thinking:**
- ❌ **No leverage understanding**: Cannot see incentive distortions
- ❌ **Moral judgment**: Confuses ethics with economic incentives
- ❌ **No solution thinking**: Cannot identify preventive mechanisms
- ❌ **Surface analysis**: Misses fundamental finance concepts

**💎 Your Credit Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the sophisticated incentive analysis and covenant design skills that credit analysts and distressed debt investors require.

### Round 2: Peer Teaching (15 minutes)
- Person A explains how leverage amplifies returns and risks
- Person B explains agency conflicts between stakeholders
- Both discuss optimal capital structure trade-offs

### Round 3: Challenge Problems (15 minutes)

**Problem 3 (Capital Structure Decision):** Company choosing between all-equity vs. 50% debt financing for expansion:
- All-equity: WACC = 12%, no financial distress risk
- 50% debt: WACC = 10%, but 5% chance of financial distress costing \$2M
Calculate expected value of each option.

**Problem 4 (Dividend vs. Debt Policy):** Company has \$10M cash. Options:
- Pay special dividend to shareholders
- Use cash to pay down debt early
- Invest in Treasury securities
Analyze from different stakeholder perspectives.

**AI Learning Support - Cash Distribution and Capital Allocation**

**Learning Goal:** Master how different uses of excess cash create value for different stakeholders and affect future financial flexibility.

**💰 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing Problem 4's cash allocation decision and want to think like a CFO balancing stakeholder interests. Special dividends please shareholders but reduce financial flexibility. Debt paydown improves credit metrics and reduces financial risk but may signal lack of growth opportunities. Keeping cash provides optionality but earns low returns. My framework considers: (1) company's growth pipeline and capital needs, (2) current leverage versus optimal capital structure, (3) tax implications of each option, (4) signaling effects to markets. How do CFOs actually make these decisions? What role do activist investors play in forcing distributions? How do credit rating implications factor in?"*

**🎯 Why This Shows Professional Treasury Management:**
- ✅ **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Considers financial, strategic, and signaling effects
- ✅ **Dynamic thinking**: Understands optionality value
- ✅ **Market awareness**: Includes activist and rating agency perspectives
- ✅ **Tax sophistication**: Recognizes distribution tax implications

**💸 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"What should they do with the cash? Which option is best?"*

**🚫 Why This Shows Poor Capital Allocation Thinking:**
- ❌ **No framework**: Cannot analyze trade-offs systematically
- ❌ **Static thinking**: Misses dynamic flexibility considerations
- ❌ **No stakeholder awareness**: Cannot balance competing interests
- ❌ **Simplistic approach**: Seeks single answer to complex decision

**🏅 Your Treasury Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the sophisticated capital allocation and stakeholder balancing skills that corporate treasurers and CFOs employ.

**Problem 5 (Incentive Analysis):** CEO compensation tied to:
a) Accounting earnings
b) Stock price performance  
c) Return on assets
How does each affect investment and financing decisions?

### Debrief Discussion
How do financing decisions create different incentives for corporate behavior?

**AI Learning Support - Agency Conflicts and Stakeholder Analysis**

**Learning Goal:** Develop expertise in analyzing how different financing structures create misaligned incentives and potential agency problems.

**🤝 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing agency conflicts in corporate finance and want to understand the nuanced incentive structures created by different capital structures. For Problem 2, I see that shareholders (as residual claimants) prefer higher-risk Project B because they capture upside while bondholders bear downside risk. This exemplifies the asset substitution problem. Beyond this textbook example, how do real companies manage these conflicts? What covenant structures do sophisticated lenders use? How do boards balance shareholder value maximization with bondholder protection? What role do credit rating agencies play in monitoring these agency issues?"*

**🎲 Why This Shows Professional Agency Theory Mastery:**
- ✅ **Theoretical grounding**: Shows understanding of asset substitution problem
- ✅ **Practical mechanisms**: Seeks real-world conflict resolution approaches
- ✅ **Multi-party awareness**: Considers board's balancing role
- ✅ **Market infrastructure**: Understands rating agency monitoring function

**😕 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"Why do shareholders and bondholders disagree on projects? Who is right?"*

**❌ Why This Shows Limited Agency Understanding:**
- ❌ **Binary thinking**: Seeks "right" answer rather than trade-offs
- ❌ **No mechanism awareness**: Cannot identify conflict resolution tools
- ❌ **Superficial analysis**: Misses deeper incentive structures
- ❌ **No practical context**: Lacks real-world application perspective

**💼 Your Agency Analysis Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the sophisticated stakeholder analysis and conflict resolution skills that corporate boards and restructuring advisors possess.

## Section 4: The Coaching - Your DRIVER Learning Guide

Let's analyze a comprehensive corporate restructuring decision, integrating capital structure effects with stakeholder incentives.

> **Case Scenario for Coaching:** Retail chain financial restructuring. StoreMax Corp has struggled with debt from leveraged buyout. Current situation: \$500M debt at 8%, \$200M equity value, EBIT = \$60M. Three restructuring options: 1) Debt-to-equity swap reducing debt to \$200M, 2) Refinance at lower 6% rate, 3) Sell assets to pay down debt. Each option affects different stakeholders differently.

**Restructuring Framework:**
```
Current Distress: High leverage -----> Financial stress -----> Stakeholder conflicts

Option 1: Equity conversion -----> Dilution -----> Debt reduction  
Option 2: Refinancing -----> Lower rates -----> Maintained leverage
Option 3: Asset sales -----> Reduced scale -----> Debt paydown

Analysis: NPV effects + stakeholder impact assessment
```

**Action:** Create framework showing incentive alignment across options.

```
Stakeholder Impact Analysis:

Current Situation:
Debt: \$500M at 8% (\$40M annual interest)
Equity: \$200M market value  
EBIT: \$60M (only \$20M after interest)

Option 1 (Debt-to-Equity Swap):
New Debt: \$200M at 8% (\$16M interest)
New EBIT after interest: \$44M
Shareholder dilution: Existing equity now 40% of company

Option 2 (Refinancing):
New Debt: \$500M at 6% (\$30M interest)
New EBIT after interest: \$30M
No dilution but still high leverage

Option 3 (Asset Sales):
Proceeds: \$300M to pay down debt
Remaining debt: \$200M at 8% (\$16M interest)

### AI Collaboration

Use AI to gather background information and financial data. Your analysis of motivations and stakeholder impacts should reflect your own critical thinking.

---

### Key Perspectives to Consider

Analyze from multiple angles:
- **Shareholder value** creation or destruction
- **Bondholder** risk and returns
- **Management** incentives and agency issues
- **Tax implications** and efficiency
- **Market signaling** effects

Corporate decisions rarely have simple explanations.

### A Note on Learning

This assignment reveals that corporate finance isn't just about maximizing value - it's about navigating competing interests, incentives, and constraints.

Understanding why companies make certain financial decisions, even when they seem suboptimal, teaches you about the real world of corporate finance where theory meets politics, psychology, and pragmatism.

**Remember: Every corporate financial decision is a story about power, incentives, and tradeoffs. Learning to read these stories makes you a sophisticated observer of business.**

## Section 7: Looking Ahead - From Stakeholder Conflicts to Business Valuation

### Session Preview
Understanding stakeholder incentives provides crucial context for Session 11's comprehensive business valuation, where conflicts affect both investment decisions and financing structures.

**Integration Framework:**
```
Session 10: Stakeholder conflicts shape financing and investment decisions
            ↓
Session 11: Valuation models must account for stakeholder dynamics
            ↓
Session 12: Comprehensive analysis integrates technical and political factors
```

**Business Valuation Preview:**
```
Stakeholder Foundation: Conflicts affect cash flows, discount rates, and strategic options
                       ↓
Valuation Application: Models incorporate governance and agency considerations
                      ↓
Strategic Decision: Complete analysis supports optimal business strategy
```

**Session 11 Preview:** "How do you value a company when management, shareholders, and bondholders have conflicting interests? How do governance factors affect business value?"

**AI Learning Support - From Corporate Finance to Business Valuation**

**Learning Goal:** Connect stakeholder analysis and capital structure decisions to comprehensive business valuation frameworks.

**🔗 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm preparing for Session 11's business valuation and want to understand how Session 10's stakeholder insights affect valuation practice. My framework: (1) capital structure affects WACC calculations through cost of debt and financial risk, (2) agency costs reduce firm value through suboptimal decisions, (3) governance quality becomes a valuation factor, (4) stakeholder relationships affect long-term cash flows. How do professional valuators incorporate these 'soft' factors into DCF models? What adjustments do they make for companies with poor governance or high agency costs? How do ESG factors increasingly affect valuation multiples?"*

**🎯 Why This Shows Professional Valuation Thinking:**
- ✅ **Integration excellence**: Connects corporate finance to valuation
- ✅ **Soft factor awareness**: Recognizes qualitative valuation inputs
- ✅ **Contemporary relevance**: Includes ESG valuation impacts
- ✅ **Practical adjustments**: Seeks real-world valuation modifications

**📊 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"How is Session 11 different from Session 10? What new stuff will we learn?"*

**❌ Why This Shows Poor Learning Integration:**
- ❌ **No connection building**: Cannot link concepts across sessions
- ❌ **Passive learning**: Waits for information rather than synthesizing
- ❌ **No framework development**: Lacks systematic thinking
- ❌ **Surface curiosity**: Misses deeper conceptual links

**🚀 Your Integration Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the sophisticated conceptual integration and forward-thinking that investment professionals use when building comprehensive valuation frameworks.

You now understand how financing decisions create stakeholder conflicts. Next, you'll learn how these dynamics affect comprehensive business valuation and strategic decision-making.
