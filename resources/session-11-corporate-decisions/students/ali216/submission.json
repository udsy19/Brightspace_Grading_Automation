So let's get\n\n8\n00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,730\nstraight into it for\nthe last one. I'm\n\n9\n00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,010\ngoing to ask the\nlast homework because\n\n10\n00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,090\nKaltura Media was\nbeing so annoying this\n\n11\n00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,510\nsemester, but at\nleast we got it done.\n\n12\n00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,450\nSo just letting you\nknow, those 10 and 12\n\n13\n00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,530\nare my drops. um okay\nso let's talk about\n\n14\n00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,870\ndriver and d to define\nand discover so what we\n\n15\n00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,870\ngot is we got to evaluate\napple's 90 billion\n\n16\n00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,190\nshare repurchase over\none year um and we\n\n17\n00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,030\ngot some let's see some\nalternatives use of\n\n18\n00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,270\ncash um we got six\ndollars special dividend\n\n19\n00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,870\nstrategic ai vr\nacquisition debt reduction\n\n20\n00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,590\nincremental rnd\nresearch and development\n\n21\n00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,970\nfor our alternatives\nand our given inputs are\n\n22\n00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,070\n165 billion cash and\ninvestments 100 billion\n\n23\n00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,210\nannual cash free flow\nfree cash flow fcf\n\n24\n00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,890\nis what you call it\num share price 185 um\n\n25\n00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,460\nyeah so this is all\nthe define basically um\n\n26\n00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,510\nand yeah that's a\nreal to investors\n\n27\n00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,530\naverage 100 shares\nthat's gonna be important\n\n28\n00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,070\nand so my delivery\nis just a single\n\n29\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,070\nvideo showing a\nmodel about driver on\n\n30\n00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,630\nthis and any recommendation\nI have focused\n\n31\n00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,030\non creating value\nfor the company\n\n32\n00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,950\nwhile balancing\nstockholder incentives.\n\n33\n00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,290\nAnd so for represent\nstage R, I'm going\n\n34\n00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,270\nto build it with,\nI'm going to use\n\n35\n00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,930\nthe code to build a\nmodel with the five\n\n36\n00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,890\nscenarios of the\nbuyback, dividend,\n\n37\n00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,090\ndebt reduction, R&D, and\nthe ai vr acquisition\n\n38\n00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,770\nthing whatever um\nso it's gonna have\n\n39\n00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,930\nall those and\nthere'll be at least a\n\n40\n00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,910\nvisualization i'm thinking\na bar chart would be\n\n41\n00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,350\nbest for the\nrepresentation um again for\n\n42\n00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,930\ndividend it'll be total\ncash cost equals dividend\n\n43\n00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,570\ndividend per share\ntimes the shares and\n\n44\n00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,320\nwe can compare it to\nthe 90 billion budget\n\n45\n00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,680\num buyback right\nhere so okay and for\n\n46\n00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,550\nimplementation let me\nwalk you through the code\n\n47\n00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,450\nso net income is income\nbase plus incremental\n\n48\n00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,910\nannual earnings and\nthen you have to\n\n49\n00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,790\ndo one minus tax rate\num for the pre-tax\n\n50\n00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,890\nto after-tax earning\num and then here just\n\n51\n00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,990\nall the formulas\nestimate price equals eps\n\n52\n00:02:52,990 --> 00:03:00,210\nafter um times the\nratio base pe so that's\n\n53\n00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,650\nimplied price exchange\nand then all these\n\n54\n00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,560\nare formulas and then\nhere are the roundings\n\n55\n00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,270\nhere and then\nvisualization for the chart\n\n56\n00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,510\nokay let's analyze\nwhat's going on here so\n\n57\n00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,790\nhere's a fine here's\nall each scenario and\n\n58\n00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,370\nall the cost budgets\nall this stuff new\n\n59\n00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,670\nnet income estimated\nprice after the epa um\n\n60\n00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,290\nand then here's\nour bar chart our\n\n61\n00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,430\nvisualization for it\nokay let's analyze\n\n62\n00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,210\nthis okay so for\nscenario one um the\n\n63\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,630\nbuyback there's\n90 billion at 185\n\n64\n00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,330\num company repurchases\nat 486 billion\n\n65\n00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,510\n46.5 billion um so\nthat reduces from 15.5\n\n66\n00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,410\nto about 15.01 um\nwhich is a 3.14 percent\n\n67\n00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,490\nreduction uh this is\njust implementation\n\n68\n00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,390\nsteps still um you\ncould do this for all\n\n69\n00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,910\nfive of them so we'll\njust go through it\n\n70\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,010\nquickly um and so\nownership present\n\n71\n00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,590\npercentages rise um like\nbecause share count is\n\n72\n00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,310\nsmaller because\nberkshire from 6.00 to 6\n\n73\n00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,070\n.19 and ceo ownership\nto 0.0194 to 0.0200\n\n74\n00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,050\nwhich is actually $20.99\n\n75\n00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,090\nand then Scenario\n2 with the fixed\n\n76\n00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,070\n$90 billion budget\ndividend per share\n\n77\n00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,470\nis about $5.81\nEPS stay $6.17\n\n78\n00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,810\nbecause the earnings\naren't changed and\n\n79\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,570\nthen the price is\nexpected to drop\n\n80\n00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,250\nto about $179.19\nwhich is the estimated\n\n81\n00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,730\nprice after $179.19 um\nand then intrigues of\n\n82\n00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,810\nvalue will fall to\n9.19 scenario three\n\n83\n00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,170\nfour and five are all\nthe same that's all\n\n84\n00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,570\nlisted here um and\nthen to validate um for\n\n85\n00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,130\nthe buyback eps\nincreases roughly in line\n\n86\n00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,570\nwith share count\nreduction um which is\n\n87\n00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,610\nhonestly expected when\nuh net income is pretty\n\n88\n00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,270\nconstant um for the\ndividend eps would\n\n89\n00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,910\nbe unchanged um the\nprice drops by the\n\n90\n00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,870\ndividend amount and then\ndebt reduction um i'll\n\n91\n00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,250\ni confirm the interest\nsavings calculation\n\n92\n00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,990\nit would just be 90\nbillion times five\n\n93\n00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,230\npercent equals 4.5\nbillion uh pre-tax um\n\n94\n00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,430\nand then you do one\nminus 0.021 um which\n\n95\n00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,630\ngives 3.555 billion\nafter tax which is the\n\n96\n00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,310\nincreasing net income\nand eps and then r&d\n\n97\n00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,170\num i'll just treat\nthose normally\n\n98\n00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,530\nand scenario dependent i\n\n99\n00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,720\nguess but yeah\nso here's this um\n\n100\n00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,750\nto the next step\nevolve yes evolve i\n\n101\n00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,470\nwould add price\nsensitivity tables for\n\n102\n00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,010\nrepurchase price um\nand interest rate on\n\n103\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,790\ndebt like 47 percent\nand maybe roic\n\n104\n00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,530\nranges for the\nacquisition and research\n\n105\n00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,070\nand development part\nalso comparing it\n\n106\n00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,890\nroic to earnings\nyield um would be good\n\n107\n00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,690\nbecause projects\nshould be earning\n\n108\n00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,030\nmore than opportunity\ncost of capital.\n\n109\n00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,090\nAnd then for the\nacquisition one, I would\n\n110\n00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,850\nprobably try to\nvary in some risk\n\n111\n00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,790\ndiscount to show how\nquickly things change.\n\n112\n00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,470\nAnd so as you\ncan see from this\n\n113\n00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,650\npicture as well,\nhere's a good visual.\n\n114\n00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,110\nThe incremental R&D\nfor the reflection\n\n115\n00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,650\nproduces the largest\nEPS implied price\n\n116\n00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,670\nincrease followed closely\nby acquisition but\n\n117\n00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,510\nboth depend on ROIC\nassumptions and risk\n\n118\n00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,790\namong the lower risk\nthere's a debt reduction\n\n119\n00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,690\nslightly beats\nbuyback 3.72 versus 3\n\n120\n00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,670\n.24 percent and then\nthe special dividends\n\n121\n00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,570\nranks weakest on EPS\nand implied price\n\n122\n00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,690\nbecause it does not\nimprove earnings and\n\n123\n00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,070\nmechanically reduces\nstock price, I'd say.\n\n124\n00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,490\nSo,\n\n125\n00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,550\nyeah, that's\nmy conclusion.\n\n126\n00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,590\nIf management\ncan earn ROIC,\n\n127\n00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,670\nthen I would go for R&D\n\n128\n00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,390\nfor sure, then\nacquisition.\n\n129\n00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,390\nBut if not, then\ndebt reduction or\n\n130\n00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,010\nbuybacks are not\nbad choices too.\n\n131\n00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,630\nJust, yeah.\n\n132\n00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,890So thanks."
