  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies both sides of the trade-off—debt’s tax shield and increased distress risk—and applies them to Apple with leverage metrics and stakeholder risk analysis. The concept is discussed in depth across DRIVER stages, demonstrating strong understanding and thorough application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains leverage’s dual effect: potential value/EPS benefits via tax shield and heightened risk via increased distress/default exposure, supported by concrete figures (leverage shift, interest rate differentials). The Validate stage explicitly connects financing choices to risk-return outcomes, meeting the criterion at a detailed, conceptual level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly distinguishes value creation vs. transfer using concrete metrics (EPS change, lost interest income, leverage shift) and ties these to agency and stakeholder effects. They also provide a nuanced, comparative signaling analysis across buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, and debt paydown. Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages collectively demonstrate strong application and interpretation, satisfying a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies stakeholder incentives and explicitly addresses asset substitution and risk-shifting via leverage changes, showing bondholders lose under buybacks while management/shareholders may gain. However, coverage is not fully comprehensive across all options and omits large holders, so while conceptually sound and applied, it lacks the depth needed for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly modeled EPS effects, accounted for lost cash interest when repurchasing shares, and reported pre/post EPS and leverage changes (IMPLEMENT/VALIDATE), showing conceptual and numeric treatment. However, critical execution assumptions (tax rate, repurchase timing/execution price and explicit share-reduction math) are not stated or shown, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly ran a baseline plus multiple scenario analyses with numeric outcomes and interpreted stakeholder impacts (IMPLEMENT + VALIDATE), demonstrating correct conceptual treatment. However, they did not present explicit sensitivity sweeps or quantified breakpoints showing at what parameter values stakeholder preferences shift; discussion of shifts was qualitative rather than a detailed breakpoint analysis, so the work is correct but incomplete.",
