  "transcript": "Hello everyone. I'm Chris Heisman and\ntoday um I am presenting my driver\nanalysis of Apple's proposed 90 billion\nshare repurchase program. So I began\nwith the defining discover phase.\nUm and our problem is simple. Apple is\nsitting at 165 billion in cash with a\nproposal to deploy 90 billion into\nbuybacks. My objective was to determine\nif this creates genuine shareholder\nvalue compared to alternatives like\nspecial dividend uh debt reduction or a\nstrategic acquisition.\nCrucially, I map the stakeholder in\nincentives while stakeholders generally\nlike returns. Employees and the CEOs\nhold options with a strike price around\n$170.\nThis creates an agency conflict. A\nspecial dividend would drop the stock\nprice and hurt those options while a\nbuyback would protect them.\nSo uh here I just put in the parameters\nin the code as you can see net income\nbaseline EPS and our target employment.\nSo\nfor our represent uh stage um I build a\nPython model to simulate those\nscenarios. Uh the core logic here is\nthat it relies on a trade-off. When we\nbuy a stock, we retire shares which\nboost EPS. However, we also lose the 4.5\ninterest income uh that we were earning\non cash. So um here in the represent\nstage, I just modeled uh those five\ndistinct scenarios.\nThe status quo, the buyback, and uh a\nspecial dividend, a debt payown, and a\ntheoretical high growth acquisition.\nSo that that code just defines it and\nhere we actually implement it.\nUm and as you can see here implement\nthat and I also calculated the total\nshareholder return to fairly compare the\ndividend payout against the buybacks\nmarket cap impact. So those are the\nresults of that scenario\nuh plan.\nNow to validate this um in the validate\nstage uh the data actually kind of\nsurprises us. If you look at the first\nchart you'll see that the buyback here\nwe go\nis actually EPS neutral and slightly\ndilutive compared to the status quo. So\nwhy well it comes down to the spread.\nApple stock\nis trading at a PE of 30 which is an\nearnings yield of only 3.3%. Meanwhile,\nour cash is earning 4.5%.\nMathematically, we're trading a high\nyield asset cash for a lower yielding\nasset, our own stock. However, if you\nlook at our second chart, the buyback is\nsuperior to the dividend in terms of\npreserving market value as it avoids the\nmechanical price drop associated with\npaying out cash. So, as you can see,\num, notice DPS. If cost of cash is\ngreater than earnings yield, EPS drops.\nNow to our evolve stage. Um I wanted to\nstress test this. Uh my question was\ndoes this decision change if the stock\nprice drops?\nSo I ran this scenario and uh our\nsensitivity graph shows that the EPS uh\naccretion at different price shares. As\nyou can see it stays below zero across\nthe entire range. This confirms that a\ncurrent interest rates the bibec is\ndifficult to justify on pure short-term\nEPS math alone. So it is mechanically\ndilutive unless the PE multiple expands\nor interest rates fall.\nSo now to our reflection and\nrecommendation.\nUm,\nI synthes synthesized the quantitative\nmath with the qualitative strategic\nneeds. And my final recommendation is\nactually going to be to authorize 90\nbillion buyback um, but with some strict\nconditions. Even though our math is\nneutral, the buyback is the correct\nstrategic choice for three reasons. One,\nagency alignment. It's going to align\nwith the incentives of the employee\noption pool. Two, signaling. It signals\ncapital discipline to the market and\nthree flexibility. Unlike a dividend,\num we are not forced to spend the money\nimmediately. We can authorize a program\nnow and execute only when the share\nprice uh dips maximizing value.\nAnd this code just\nsynthesizes those results.\nAnd yeah, that's it. Thank you very muchand I hope you enjoyed my analysis."
