  "transcript": "Here is my transcript:\n0:00\nAll right, this is my session 11 video\n0:02\nassignment. So, let's jump right into\n0:04\nit. So, the assignment overview here is\n0:06\nwe must evaluate Apple's hypothetical\n0:09\n$90 billion share purchase using\n0:12\ndriver. Um we're going to act as\n0:14\nindependent analysts who must determine\n0:16\nwhether the buyback creates value\n0:18\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\n0:20\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\n0:23\nSome of the capital allocation snapshot\n0:25\nis we have some liquidity stuff like\n0:27\n$165 billion cash in investments. Uh for\n0:31\nmarket context, we have $185 share\n0:34\nprice. Uh PE of 30, a dividend yield of\n0:37\n0.5% and a $15.5 billion shares\n0:40\noutstanding.\n0:42\nUm and we have some other stuff that's\n0:44\non the balance sheet in the proposal.\n0:46\nAnd uh the alternatives that we're going\n0:48\nto look at is the $6 special dividend, a\n0:51\nstrategic AR/VR acquisition, and a debit\n0:55\nreduction and a incremental R&D are the\n0:58\nother alternatives. So now that we've\n1:00\ngone over some allocation, let's jump\n1:01\ninto our driver framework. So first\n1:04\nwe're going to define the problem,\n1:05\ndiscover our constraints. So the the\n1:08\npropo the proposal is to spend 90\n1:11\nbillion which is approximately 10% of\n1:13\nthe market cap to retire shares within\n1:15\none year. The context of all this is\n1:17\nthat Apple trades $185 with a P/E of 30.\n1:22\nUm it is a cash uh rich um but expensive\n1:26\nrel uh relative to current yield current\n1:29\nearnings yield. Um and then kind of like\n1:32\nthe conflict of all this is that we must\n1:35\ndetermine if buying back um stock at an\n1:38\nall-time high of PE of30 is prudent\n1:41\ncompared to in other alternatives like\n1:44\npaying a special dividend or something\n1:46\nelse. So um our discovery phrase\n1:50\nhighlights a critical tension um first\n1:52\nbetween value creation and uh versus\n1:55\ntransfer at a PE of 30. The earnings\n1:58\nyield is only 3.3%. If ca if if cash\n2:01\nearns 5% in treasuries, a buyback is\n2:04\ntechnically EPS dulative unless we\n2:06\nassume significant future growth growth.\n2:10\nStakeholder incentives management holds\n2:13\noptions $170 strike. A bayback uh a\n2:17\nbuyback supports the stock price,\n2:19\nkeeping those options in in the money.\n2:22\nConversely, a dividend drops the stock\n2:23\nprice hurting option holders but\n2:25\nrewarding income-seeking retail\n2:27\ninvestors immediately.\n2:29\nSo next we're going to represent our\n2:31\ninte approach by using a flows chart to\n2:34\num use as a map of our plan and how we\n2:37\nwill go about creating a proper model.\n2:39\nSo as you can see from this flow chart\n2:41\nthe inputs are going to just be the\n2:43\nstuff we have which is the share price\n2:45\nthe share count the tax rates and the\n2:47\nsoon return on cash. The engine is um\n2:50\ngoing to be a Python script that's going\n2:51\nto be used to calculate the break even\n2:55\nuh PE and the net cash position. Uh we\n2:59\nwill also compute the EPS impact and\n3:02\nother calculations of a buyback versus\n3:04\nthe other alternatives including $6\n3:06\nspecial dividends, strategic AI/VR\n3:09\nacquisition, a debt reduction and\n3:12\nincremental R&D. Um this will lead to\n3:14\nthe overall output of the calculations\n3:17\nneed for each scenario along with a\n3:19\nquick financial analysis and a\n3:21\nstockholder narrative comparison. So now\n3:24\nthat we've represented how we're going\n3:26\nto build this Python uh using a\n3:28\nflowchart, let's go to the implement\n3:30\nstage. So here's my code that was\n3:32\ncreated by um Google Gemini. Basically,\n3:35\nwe have the input variables here. The\n3:38\nfirst section is going to calculate the\n3:40\ncore financial calculations.\n3:42\nUm the second's going to be our going to\n3:44\nstart our scenarios. It's going to be\n3:46\nscenario A because it's the buyback and\n3:48\nit's going to compare them to the alter\n3:49\nalternatives which is the special\n3:51\ndividend. Um and some of the other ones\n3:56\nwait sorry special dividend uh the\n3:59\nstrategic acquisition\n4:01\nuh the debt reduction and the\n4:03\nincremental R&D. And then we'll just end\n4:06\nwith a stakeholder um comparison\n4:10\nuh overall comparison. So this is going\n4:12\nto all this if we run this code based on\n4:14\nthese sections we're going to have this\n4:17\noutput. So section one is the core\n4:19\ncalculations. So the earnings per share\n4:21\nis calculated to be $6.17\n4:24\nuh cents with a new cash position of\n4:27\n55.0 billion. Um section two is going to\n4:31\nbe our first scenario. So the buyback um\n4:34\nthe new share count is 15 uh.01 01\n4:36\nbillion which we found by doing current\n4:38\nshares um minus uh 90 billion divide by\n4:43\nthe price of $185.\n4:46\nThe new EPS is calculated to be the\n4:48\n$6.37 which we found by doing the net\n4:51\nincome divided by the new share count.\n4:53\nKind of quick analysis of that is that\n4:55\nthis is mechanically increasing EPS by\n4:58\nreducing the denominator.\n5:00\nUm sections three is a special dividend.\n5:03\nUm the dividend per share is going to be\n5:05\n$5.81\n5:07\nand the adjusted share price um ex div\n5:12\nis $179.19.\n5:15\nThe analyst of this is that it's a cash\n5:18\nneutral but drops price closer to the\n5:20\nemployee strike zone. For section four\n5:22\nof the strategic acquisition, we\n5:24\ncalculated a new net income to be\n5:26\n$104.58\n5:28\nbillion\n5:31\n$104.58 billion and a new EPS of 6.75.\n5:35\nUm this shows a higher EPS potential\n5:38\nthan buyback but carries massive\n5:40\nexecution risk. And then uh the section\n5:44\nfive the debt reduction the interest\n5:45\nsavings we calculated to be 3.60\n5:48\nbillion and we did this by doing the\n5:50\ndebt repayment times interest rate and\n5:52\nthen for the new EPS we calculated it to\n5:54\nbe $6.4.\n5:56\nUh the analysts of this um scenarios\n5:59\nthat the lower the lower the risk um but\n6:02\nlowest return as the lowest risk but\n6:04\nlowest return as well um but is\n6:07\ninsufficient for a cashrich firm. And\n6:10\nthen lastly incremental R&D the uh\n6:13\nprojected future EPS of this is $6.86\n6:15\n$86.\n6:17\nUm, and just kind of analyze this. Um,\n6:19\nit does have the highest theoretical\n6:21\nreturn, but it also has the highest\n6:22\nuncertainty and time lag.\n6:25\nSo, just kind of a stakeholder narrative\n6:28\ncomparison. Um, the EPS comparison\n6:31\nacquisition is first with 6.75, then\n6:34\nbuyback was 6.37, then de uh debit\n6:38\nreduction was around $6.4\n6:40\nand dividend of $6.17.\n6:43\nUm a quick note about the employee\n6:45\nsafety. Um the dividend drop price uh\n6:48\nthe dividend drops price to $179\n6:52\nwhich risk the $170 strike options um\n6:56\nwhile the buyback supports the price. So\n6:58\nnow that we've read the output, let's uh\n7:00\nvalidate all this. So first we need to\n7:03\nvalidate these scenarios against marker\n7:05\nrealities for the debit reduction\n7:07\nefficiency. Um the model is going to\n7:09\nshow debit reduction yielding $6.4 $4\n7:12\nEPS. This assumes we say 4% interest.\n7:15\nHowever, Apple is likely likely plays\n7:18\nlower effective rates between two to two\n7:21\nto 3% uh on older bonds. So if we adjust\n7:25\nfor this debt reduction EPS um drops\n7:28\nbelow the buyback EPS which results in a\n7:30\ndebt reduction is insuff insufficient\n7:34\ninefficient.\n7:35\nUm, for acquisition risks, the\n7:38\nacquisition shows a high EPS of 6.75,\n7:41\nbut finding a 90 billion target that\n7:44\nimmediately yields 10% is nearly\n7:46\nimpossible. Um, so large M&A often\n7:49\ndestroys value through integration\n7:51\nfriction. And lastly, the liquidation\n7:53\nsafety. Um, you know, spending 90\n7:55\nbillion leaves 75 billion cash. Um,\n7:58\ngiven the 100 billion annual inflow, um,\n8:01\nthis shows that the buffer is safe. Now\n8:04\nlet's evolve our argument. So to evolve\n8:07\num we're going to realize that numbers\n8:09\nare only half the decision. We must now\n8:11\napply agency theory and governance\n8:13\nprinciples to determine real value\n8:14\ncreation and quantify stakeholder\n8:16\noutcomes. So looking at value creation\n8:19\nversus value trans transfer. Um if Apple\n8:22\nbuybacks um the Apple stock is trading\n8:25\nbelow intrinsic value. So a buyback\n8:27\nwould create value for long-term\n8:29\nshareholders by concentrating their\n8:30\nownership. If the stock is overvalued,\n8:33\nit destroys value. So given Apple's\n8:36\ndurable ecosystem, I think we can cons\n8:38\nwe can assume that the intrinsic value\n8:40\nis greater than $185.\n8:43\nFor the dividend, um this is just going\n8:45\nto be a pure value transfer as it's\n8:48\nmoving cash from the corporate balance\n8:49\nsheet to shareholders, triggering an\n8:51\nimmediate tax liability for taxable\n8:54\naccounts like Birkshshire Hathway. Um so\n8:57\nthis will create no structural\n8:58\nadvantage. Now looking at the\n9:00\nquantitative stakeholder outcomes for\n9:03\nretail and institutional holders under\n9:05\nthe buyback the share count dropped by\n9:08\nabout 3.2%\n9:10\num this means every shareholder sees the\n9:12\ntheir percentage ownership of the\n9:14\ncompany increasing by 3.2%\n9:17\num without investing a single extra\n9:18\ndollar for bond holders. While cash\n9:21\ndrops by 90 billion the net cash\n9:23\nposition remains positive at 75 billion.\n9:26\nSo this means that credit risk is going\n9:28\nto remain uh negligible.\n9:30\nAnd lastly for employee employees as\n9:33\ncalculated the dividend al alternative\n9:36\ndrops the price to $179.\n9:39\nA standard market correction of 5% would\n9:41\npush the stock below $170. This would\n9:44\nleave um employee options\n9:47\num out of money destroying retention\n9:49\nincentives. Um but the buyback would uh\n9:52\nprevent this.\n9:54\nNow looking at agency and governance\n9:57\nimplications. So some of management\n9:59\nincentives um the CEOs paid on EPS\n10:02\ngrowth. Um the model confirms that that\n10:05\nthe buyback increases EPS to $6.37.\n10:08\nAnd since management is heavily uh\n10:10\nbiased toward this um this shows that\n10:12\nmanagement is high heavily biased\n10:14\ntowards this option. While this looks\n10:16\nlike agency cost in this case, it aligns\n10:18\nwith shareholder interest by avoiding\n10:21\nwasteful empire building accusations.\n10:24\nNow looking at employee retention, the\n10:26\nthis was kind of mentioned earlier too.\n10:28\nThe $170 strike mainly is what we're\n10:30\ngoing to look at. Um this is going to be\n10:32\na critical governance constraint. A\n10:34\nspecial dividend drops the price to 179\n10:37\nlike we said. So if market volatality\n10:39\nhits, the price could slide below 170\n10:42\nmaking employee options worthless. Um\n10:44\nthis would cause a retention crisis. Um\n10:47\nand this further elaborates that the\n10:49\nbuyback is central for HR stability. So\n10:51\nthat's basically what we put up here\n10:53\ntoo. Um lastly for like the signaling\n10:56\nand market perceptions um a buyback\n10:58\nsignal is going to be like one that we\n11:00\nare confident our stock is undervalued\n11:02\nand our cash flow is stable. This is a\n11:04\nsignal strength while a dividend signal\n11:06\nis going to be you know we have run out\n11:08\nof growth ideas. Um this is a dividend\n11:11\nsignal because it signals the company is\n11:13\nis um is X growth and transition\n11:17\ntransition transitioning to a utility-l\n11:20\nlike stock for acquisition single a uh\n11:24\nyou know a 90 billion acquisition signal\n11:26\num signals desperation for growth often\n11:28\nalarming the market about the core uh\n11:31\nbusiness health. So now that we've kind\n11:33\nof looked at um more of the theories and\n11:36\nprinciples behind value creation and\n11:39\nstakeholder outcomes, let's go to our\n11:42\nreflection and slash recommend\n11:44\nrecommendation. So you know reflecting\n11:46\non the tension between all the\n11:48\ntheoretical returns and R&D acquisition\n11:52\nand the risk adjusted reality. Um we're\n11:54\ngonna uh make a final recommendation\n11:57\nthat we're gonna authorize the $90\n12:00\nbillion share repurchase buyback\n12:03\nprogram.\n12:04\nThe rational behind that is from three\n12:07\ndifferent thing things. First uh for\n12:09\nstakeholder alignment. It just it just\n12:12\nsatisfies the institutional um investors\n12:16\num and it protects employee compensation\n12:19\nas the price support is going to be\n12:21\ngreater than $170 strike. And it also\n12:23\njust aligns with management incentives.\n12:26\nUm for the strategic discipline, it's\n12:28\ngoing to avoid the winner's curse of\n12:30\nmassive acquisitions and the X growth um\n12:34\nsignaling off a special dividend. And\n12:36\nthen lastly for the governance, um a\n12:39\nbuyback is going to just return excess\n12:41\ncapital to shareholders rather than uh\n12:43\nhoarding it, which enforces capital\n12:45\ndiscipline on management. So that so\n12:48\nfrom this rationale it's obvious that\n12:51\nthe $90 billion share um buyback program\n12:54\nis the best um decision for the company.\n12:59\nUm I hope you enjoyed and I hope you\n13:01have a good day. That's in my project."
