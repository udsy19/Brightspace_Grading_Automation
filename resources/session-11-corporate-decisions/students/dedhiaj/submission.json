So I'm going to be\n0:07\nevaluating Apple's proposed 90 billion\n0:10\nshare depase program using the driver\n0:12\nframework. So driver is the structure\n0:15\nfor how the analysis unfolds. But in\n0:17\nthis presentation I'll keep the flow\n0:19\nnatural and continuous while still\n0:21\ncovering each step of the driver\n0:23\nframework. So let's see what we have.\n0:26\nSwap's current financial position\n0:28\ncreates a lot of opportunity. It has\n0:31\n$165 billion in cash and marketable\n0:34\nsecurities. So basically all its liquid\n0:37\nassets, produces roughly 100 billion in\n0:41\na year in free cash flow, trades around\n0:44\n185 um dollars per share and has 15.5\n0:48\nbillion shares outstanding. Apple also\n0:51\ncarries 110 billion in debt. Investors\n0:54\nuh include Burkshshire Hathway H with\n0:57\nabout a six% stake in Apple, a chief\n1:00\nexecutive with roughly three million\n1:02\nshares, retail shareholders who\n1:04\ntypically hold small positions like 100\n1:06\nshares and employees with stock options\n1:08\nat $170\n1:10\nstrike.\n1:12\nSo the question for me is not simply can\n1:15\nafford a $90 billion repurchase of a\n1:18\nstate can. The question is will the\n1:20\nstakeholders and will all the investors\n1:22\nbenefit from that purchase or will they\n1:25\nbe harmed. So to explore that we've\n1:28\nbuilt a simple Python model that\n1:30\ncompares the buyback with this\n1:31\nalternatives. Before running it I want\n1:34\nto explain the basic logic behind what\n1:36\nthe whole model is and the setup. So\n1:39\nbasically when a company does a buyback\n1:41\nthe mechanics are straightforward. Take\n1:43\nthe amount of cash allocated divide by\n1:45\nthe share price and that gives the\n1:47\nnumber of shares retired. Fewer shares\n1:49\noutstanding means earnings per share\n1:51\nrises even if the total profit will stay\n1:53\nthe same. So this is a key source of a\n1:56\nmisunderstanding around buybacks. An\n1:58\nincrease in earnings per share is not\n1:59\nautomatically value creation for the\n2:01\nshare and that does not mean the share\n2:04\nvalue goes up. It is obvious obviously\n2:06\nand very often a value arrangement. So\n2:10\nthe other alternatives have different\n2:11\nprofiles. A special dividend returns\n2:14\ncash directly to their shareholders\n2:16\nevery month as soon as Apple makes a\n2:18\nprofit. Debt reduction decreases\n2:20\nfinancial risk and strengthens the\n2:22\nbalance sheet for Apple. A strategic\n2:25\nacquisition could create a long-term\n2:27\ngrowth if executed well and planned very\n2:29\nwell.\n2:31\nSo let's run the Python model.\n2:37\nOkay, so this is what we have. This is\n2:41\nthe cash use. So we have all these\n2:43\ncolumns scenario of every scenario that\n2:46\nwe have which is buyback, dividend, debt\n2:49\nreduction, acquisition and R&D\n2:51\ninvestment, amount of cash used for\n2:53\neverything, the share count after cash,\n2:56\nthe EPS estimate, the debt after the\n2:58\nscenario like whatever we do and the\n3:01\nstrategic benefit.\n3:05\nSo this model is intentionally like very\n3:08\nsimple. So the economies are really easy\n3:11\nto understand. The first section sets up\n3:12\nApple's financial inputs. Basically\n3:15\ncash, free cash flow, the current share\n3:18\nprice, shares outstanding, the debt, the\n3:21\nbuyback size, the EPS, all of that. The\n3:24\nsec section um calculates the number of\n3:27\nshares repurchased. We um divide $90\n3:30\nbillion by the share price of $185\n3:33\nthat was given to us. Then the code\n3:36\ncalculates the new earnings per share by\n3:37\nscaling existing EPS based or the EPS of\n3:41\nsix based on the ratio of the old shares\n3:44\nto the new shares. Because there are\n3:45\nfewer shares, the earnings per share\n3:47\nnumber goes up. Even though nothing\n3:49\nabout Apple's business performance has\n3:51\nactually changed, the next block um\n3:54\nmodels for the alternatives for\n3:56\ndividends, we take $6 multiplied by\n3:58\n$15.5 billion shares.\n4:01\nDebt reduction is modeled by reducing\n4:03\nthe outstanding debt by the buyback\n4:05\namount and the acquisition scenario\n4:07\nassumes Apple uses $90 billion dollar by\n4:10\na major artificial intelligence or\n4:12\nvirtual reality company. I included a\n4:15\n12% expected return which is like a very\n4:17\nbasic market return on the invested\n4:19\ncapital for illustration. This isn't a\n4:22\nforecast of the actual deal that can\n4:24\nhappen. It's basically a demonstration\n4:26\nof how the acquisition will create value\n4:28\nfor Apple.\n4:30\nAnd finally, the R&D scenario basically\n4:32\ninvests $90 billion into new innovation.\n4:36\nThis doesn't provide short-term\n4:37\nnumerical gains obviously, but in\n4:39\nincreases the long-term opportunity by\n4:42\nquite a bit. And finally, the model\n4:44\ncombines all of this into a table with\n4:46\ncashew, share counts, earning per share,\n4:48\ndebt levels, and a brief description of\n4:50\nevery strategic benefits.\n4:54\nOkay. So the buyback reduces the share\n4:58\ncount and the boost the earning per\n5:00\nshare obviously. So that is the first\n5:02\nlike that's the basic scenario of the\n5:04\nbuyback. So a large institutional\n5:07\nholders like Burkshshire gain the most\n5:09\nfrom this in relative terms of each\n5:11\nremaining share um which will represent\n5:14\na slightly larger ownership claim.\n5:16\nManagement also benefits because\n5:18\nearnings per share is a common\n5:19\nperformance metric right with\n5:21\ncompensation. Employees with stock\n5:23\noptions at $170\n5:26\nuh strike like stake price will also\n5:28\nbenefit because um buybacks will support\n5:31\na higher stock price eventually giving\n5:34\nthem a higher net worth or a net value\n5:36\nof the stocks that they have. However,\n5:39\nbuybacks use cash that could strengthen\n5:42\nthe balance sheet. Bond holders and\n5:44\ncredit ratings agency usually like would\n5:47\nprefer debt redu reduction over large\n5:50\ncash outflows. From their point of view,\n5:53\na $90 billion buyback weakens the margin\n5:56\nof safety. If Apple paid down debt\n5:58\ninstead, the financial risk of the\n6:00\nbusiness would drop by a lot. Comparing\n6:03\nthe buyback with special dividend, the\n6:05\ndividend treats all shareholders\n6:07\nuniformly and provides immediate\n6:09\nliquidity. Some investors prefer\n6:11\ndividends because they can decide for\n6:12\nthemselves whether they want to reinvest\n6:14\nthat cash into other stocks or do\n6:16\nwhatever they want with that stock. The\n6:18\ntrade-off of dividends is do not improve\n6:21\nthe future earnings per share or the\n6:23\nstrategic capabilities.\n6:26\nNow let's look about the acquisition and\n6:28\nR&D alternatives. They're the only one\n6:30\nwith potentially expanding Apple's\n6:33\nfuture earnings capacity and IR or VR\n6:36\nacquisition could reposition Apple\n6:38\ncompetitively in emerging technology\n6:40\nmarkets. But acquisitions also carry\n6:43\nintegration challenges and the risk of\n6:45\noverpayment and other challenges like\n6:47\nthe company being too big to handle to\n6:50\nmanage what about the the company not\n6:52\nbeing effective enough working with\n6:54\nApple's employees. Why all these\n6:57\ninvestments do not boost short-term\n6:59\nmetrics? They will support long-term\n7:01\nvalue creation. Even R&D will strengthen\n7:03\nApple's innovation engine and it will\n7:05\nalign with their historical strengths of\n7:08\nalways innovating to the new generation.\n7:11\nSo this is a deeper point behind all\n7:13\nthese comparisons. Capital allocation\n7:15\ndecisions create winners and losers.\n7:17\nThey reshape in incentives within the\n7:20\nfirm. When earnings per share becomes\n7:22\nthe main focus, management may buy uh\n7:24\nfavor buybacks over long-term\n7:26\ninvestments. Even if the investments\n7:28\ncould generate higher strategic value\n7:29\nand higher long-term gains, this is one\n7:31\nof the classic agency problems for\n7:33\ncorporate finance. So, the stakeholder\n7:36\nconflicts will become clear. Long-term\n7:39\nshareholders may prefer growth\n7:40\ninvestments like the buybacks.\n7:42\nShort-term shareholders may prefer the\n7:44\nbuybacks or dividends. Long-term will\n7:47\nprefer acquisition or R&D. Bond holders\n7:50\nwill prefer debt reduction and lower\n7:52\nfinancial risk. Obviously, employees\n7:54\nbenefit from innovation spending that\n7:56\ncreates new products. Executives\n7:59\nsometimes benefit from buybacks before\n8:01\nbecause performance metrics improve the\n8:04\nmechan mechanically.\n8:08\nSo basically what my recommendation is\n8:11\nputting all of this together in a $90\n8:13\nbillion buyback does deliver a financial\n8:15\nbenefit through increased earnings per\n8:17\nshare because the share EPS uh will rise\n8:21\nbecause the share count will fall and uh\n8:25\nbut its true value depends on whether\n8:26\nApple believes the stock is undervalued\n8:29\nor whether it lacks higher return\n8:30\nopportunities elsewhere. If Apple have\n8:33\ncredible opportunities in AI, augmented\n8:36\nreality, silicon engineering, and other\n8:38\nstrategic areas, investing in growth and\n8:41\nR&D could create a more long-term value\n8:43\nthan a single large repurchase. If those\n8:47\nopportunities are scarce and\n8:48\nunconvincing, uh, returning capital to\n8:51\nshareholders through buybacks or\n8:53\ndividends is a more reasonable choice\n8:54\nobviously. So, my balance recommendation\n8:57\nis that buybacks make sense only if it\n8:59\ndoes not crowd our strategic investment.\n9:02\nApple should continue buying back shares\n9:04\nbut only while maintaining robust\n9:06\nspending on innovation and also trying\n9:09\nto do some more R&D and acquisitions for\n9:12\nthe future for a long-term growth\n9:13\nstrategy. So this analysis highlights a\n9:16\nbroader lesson. Financial decisions are\n9:18\nnot only just mathematical. They reflect\n9:20\non incentives, governments completion\n9:23\nand long-term strategy. Understanding\n9:25\nhow these forces interact to central um\n9:29\nis evaluating any large corporate\n9:32financial decision."
