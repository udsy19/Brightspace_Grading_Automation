  "transcript": "0:02\nHello, this is uh management 310\n0:04\nassignment 11. Today's objective is to\n0:07\nevaluate Apple's hypothetical 90 billion\n0:10\num share repurchase. So, I'm going to be\n0:13\nacting as an independent analyst to\n0:14\ndetermine whether the buyback creates\n0:16\nvalue relative to the alternative uses.\n0:18\nBut to dive into the define and\n0:20\ndiscover, what we're actually going to\n0:22\nbe um finding is a recommendation that\n0:26\nexplains stakeholder impacts, agency\n0:29\nconsiderations, and value creation\n0:30\nversus uh value transfer outcomes.\n0:35\nSo now that we have the key basis of\n0:37\nwhat we're doing, here's the data we are\n0:38\ngiven. So we're given the liquidity, we\n0:41\nare given the market context\n0:44\nwith 15.5 billion shares outstanding.\n0:46\nWe're given the balance the balance\n0:48\nsheet info with um some other metrics\n0:52\nand we have the proposal for the buyback\n0:54\nand the other alternatives that we need\n0:56\nto look into.\n0:58\nI wanted to quickly define what the\n0:59\nstrategic ARVR acquisition is. Um I\n1:02\nbelieve that just means a strategic um\n1:05\nbuy of an AI or virtual reality um\n1:09\npowered tool we're training by a large\n1:12\ntech company.\n1:14\nBut for our actual analysis um we are\n1:17\ngiven that we have to quantify the\n1:18\nstakeholder outcomes under the buyback\n1:20\ncompare the buyback to our um other um\n1:25\nalternatives. We are then going to\n1:27\nevaluate whether the program creates\n1:29\nvalue and then we are going to discuss\n1:31\num signal signaling effects market\n1:34\nperception and then we're also going to\n1:35\ndeliver our recommendation.\n1:38\nSo now that we have defined and\n1:40\ndiscovered what we need to do, let's\n1:41\ndive into what we are actually going to\n1:43\nbe doing with our represent.\n1:48\nSo our main goal is to evaluate Apple's\n1:51\n$90 billion buyback and deliver a\n1:53\nrecommendation. So firstly, we're going\n1:54\nto have to quantify the outcomes under\n1:56\nthe buyback. So we're going to look at\n1:57\nthe retail and inst institutional\n1:59\nholders. Um we're going to look at\n2:01\nmanagement. We're also going to look at\n2:02\nemployees and bond holders and see how\n2:04\nthat affects everyone. and um\n2:08\nand the assets that they own.\n2:11\nThen next we're going to compare the\n2:12\nbuyback to other rational options. So as\n2:15\nseen earlier, we're going to compare it\n2:16\nto a special dividend, the acquisition\n2:18\nof AI, um debt reduction, research and\n2:22\num\n2:23\nand development alternatives. But how\n2:25\nare we going to do this? We're going to\n2:26\nlook at the earnings per share impact.\n2:28\nWe're going to look at ownership\n2:30\nchanges. is we're going to look at uh\n2:31\nthe return on\n2:34\ninvested capital leverage and also the\n2:37\nstrategic fit. Leverage is really just\n2:38\ndebt. Uh thirdly, we're going to\n2:41\nevaluate whether the program creates\n2:43\nvalue or if it uh just transfers among\n2:46\nthe shareholders. We're also going to\n2:47\nlook at the agency and government\n2:49\nimplications of that. And then we're\n2:50\ngoing to show visually how the structure\n2:52\nshifts uh within the company.\n2:56\nUh lastly, we're going to deliver our\n2:57\nfinal recommendation. This is going to\n2:59\ndiscuss signal effects per u market\n3:01\nperception and long-term capital\n3:03\nallocation tied to each option. And\n3:05\nthroughout our whole analysis model,\n3:08\nwe're going to have to provide\n3:09\nassumptions clearly throughout.\n3:11\nSo we have a good plan of what we're\n3:12\ngoing to do. So let's go ahead and dive\n3:14\ninto our implement stage.\n3:16\nSo here's the model that I'll be walking\n3:18\nthrough. Firstly, we'll just look at all\n3:19\nthe information we laid out here. So\n3:21\nwe're given the Apple valuation, the\n3:22\ncurrent price, and the PE ratio along\n3:24\nwith the yield. We're given the\n3:26\nliquidity with the annual free cash\n3:28\nflow, um the leverage debt. We're\n3:30\nlooking at our proposal of the buyback\n3:32\nand our current shares that are out.\n3:35\nBut let's dive into our first analysis.\n3:37\nSo we have to quantify the stakeholder\n3:39\noutcomes under the buyback\n3:41\nunder the key assumptions that the\n3:43\nbuyback execution is at 90 billion\n3:46\nallocated to retire shares at current\n3:48\nmarket price of 185. The existing\n3:50\nshareholders, Bur uh Birkshshire holds\n3:52\nabout 6% and employees hold $170 strike\n3:56\noptions. As far as the share count goes,\n3:58\nwe just said is 15.5 billion\n4:00\noutstanding. Uh liquidity, uh 165\n4:04\nbillion in cash and investments\n4:05\navailable versus the 110 in debt. And as\n4:07\nfar as the valuation goes, we are\n4:09\nlooking at a 30 um implied PE ratio with\n4:12\nan earnings yield of about 3.3%.\n4:15\nSo under those key assumptions we can\n4:17\nlook at the impact of each group.\n4:22\nSo in our data we know that the uh\n4:23\nretail shareholders average around 100\n4:25\nshares. So this key metric what we see\n4:28\npost buyback is a ownership increase of\n4:30\nabout 3%. This would be positive as tax\n4:33\ndeferred compounding causes ownership\n4:34\nexpands without any cash outlay which is\n4:36\ngreat. So that's for retail. But now\n4:38\nlet's let's look at institutional. So\n4:40\nthey have about a 6% stake and that\n4:41\nwould jump about 2%. So this would be\n4:44\npositive again. Um it's a passive stake\n4:46\nincrease because uh the float shrinks\n4:48\nwhile they hold. Uh just basic supply\n4:50\nand demand with a buyback.\n4:52\nAs far as management goes, we know they\n4:54\nhave 3 million shares. And\n4:57\nafter the buyback, we're going to be\n4:58\nlooking at a earnings per share target\n5:00\naccretion.\n5:02\nIt is similar to these two up here as um\n5:04\nthey would gain some positive outcome\n5:07\nbut a little bit mixed for the capital\n5:09\nallocation discipline.\n5:11\nUh now let's look into employees. So we\n5:14\nknow that they have $170 strike options\n5:16\nand their price support would be greater\n5:18\nthan that. So it would be positive. It\n5:21\npro it protects the compensation value\n5:23\nbecause buyback uh increases the price\n5:25\nfloor. So these three have been positive\n5:27\nso far. But now when we look at the bond\n5:29\nholders uh they start with 55 billion in\n5:31\nnet cash and then they would be in net\n5:34\ndebt position likely. this would be very\n5:37\nnegative for them um because credit risk\n5:39\nrises because the 90 billion liquidity\n5:42\nbuffer is removed.\n5:45\nSo from this buyback we really just see\n5:47\nthat the bond holders get the short end\n5:48\nof the stick\n5:51\nto kind of dive into a little bit more\n5:52\ndetail about what I just said. Um this\n5:55\nwould be preferable to uh dividends. We\n5:58\nhaven't gotten to that point yet, but\n5:59\nbecause it avoids immediate tax events\n6:01\nand long-term holders like Birkshshire\n6:03\num effectively reinvesting capital into\n6:05\nstock on a tax deferred basis, which is\n6:08\nuh great. So these are the primary\n6:09\nbeneficiaries. When we look at the\n6:11\nmanagement and employees, um the spread\n6:13\nis narrow. Um a buyback acts as a\n6:15\ndefensive measure to keep options in the\n6:17\nmoney uh because it provides a\n6:19\nnon-operational demand for shares\n6:21\ndirectly supporting retention\n6:22\nincentives. And as we said earlier, the\n6:24\nbond holders got the short end of the\n6:25\nstick because their liquidity buffer um\n6:28\nalters significantly.\n6:33\nTo take a little bit of a deeper dive\n6:34\ninto what we're actually looking in with\n6:36\nthe uh risk and incentives for each for\n6:39\nthe retail shareholders, we already\n6:40\ntalked about their benefits, but the\n6:42\nrisk is the valuation. Um if the\n6:44\nintrinsic value is below 185, management\n6:46\ndestroys any shareholder wealth because\n6:47\nthey are spending $1 of cash to buy less\n6:50\nthan a dollar of value. And then as far\n6:52\nas incentives goes, it would be the\n6:55\nincentive would be like a holding\n6:57\ndiscipline. Uh retail investors are\n6:58\nincentivized to hold because selling the\n7:00\nbuyback um would crystallize taxes\n7:03\nwhereas holding it captures the\n7:05\nincreased ownership stake. This kind of\n7:07\nties into the lock in effect um when\n7:09\npeople tend to hold on to stocks for\n7:11\nlonger than they want to because they\n7:13\ndon't want to have to pay on capital\n7:15\ngains and they have a increased\n7:17\nownership stake.\n7:19\nWhen you look at the institutional side,\n7:21\nwe already talked about the benefits,\n7:23\nbut the risk is concentration. Um, as\n7:25\nthe stake is growing, the portfolio\n7:27\nbecomes overweight in Apple without any\n7:28\nactive decision-making, potentially\n7:30\nviolating risk limits. So, they might\n7:31\nhave to rebalance the portfolio there.\n7:34\nBut incentives would be alignment\n7:36\nbecause institutions typically vote for\n7:37\nVIAX because it improves the EPS and it\n7:41\nfunds performance without requiring any\n7:42\ncapital deployment which institutional\n7:44\ninvestors love. As far as the management\n7:47\ngoes, uh the risk would be capital\n7:49\nmisallocation. The management may\n7:50\nprioritize financial engineering over\n7:52\nresearch and development because it's\n7:54\nmore risky and it hits short-term\n7:56\nearnings while buybacks are quote\n7:58\nunquote safe. Um as far as the\n8:00\nincentives goes, their incentive mainly\n8:02\nwould be risk adversion. Um so returning\n8:05\ncash align with short-term stock\n8:07\nperformance targets, uh discouraging\n8:09\nrisky bets on new product categories. So\n8:12\ntheir uh their risk would be a little\n8:14\nbit lower.\n8:16\nAnd then as far as the um employees go,\n8:19\nuh their main risk is uh the fragility\n8:22\nsince they are option holders. So if the\n8:24\nstock price is supported primarily by\n8:26\nthe buybacks rather than the product\n8:27\ninnovation, a pause and buyback program\n8:29\ncould crash the stock to below 170 which\n8:32\nwould not be good for them. But their\n8:33\nincentives would be price fixations\n8:35\nbecause employees have become ma mainly\n8:37\nmore focused on the daily stock price\n8:39\nthan the product quality because their\n8:40\ncompensation is levered to the equity.\n8:44\nand uh they're just making more money.\n8:45\nWho doesn't like more money? The bond\n8:48\nholders uh their main risk is credit uh\n8:50\nmigration. So while default is unlikely\n8:52\ngiven the 100 billion free cash flow, uh\n8:55\nthe reduction in the cash flow or the uh\n8:56\ncash buffer makes the credit rating more\n8:59\nsensitive to future earnings volatility.\n9:01\nAs far as their incentives go, uh we're\n9:03\nlooking at covenant demand, which is\n9:05\nbasically just an agreement to receive\n9:08\nbenefits. But um future debt issuance\n9:12\nmay come with stricter covenants because\n9:13\nlenders want to restrict future cash\n9:15\noutflows. To sum it all up, our biggest\n9:17\nwinners here would be the retail um\n9:19\nshareholders and uh the institutional\n9:22\nalong with management because they gain\n9:23\nbecause they capture uh the cash flow\n9:26\nbenefits through the uh tax deferred\n9:28\nprice appreciation rather than the\n9:29\ntaxable income. uh the highest risk\n9:31\nexposure would be the bond holders and\n9:33\nthe future shareholders because bond\n9:34\nholders lose their collateral and the\n9:36\nfuture investors must pay a higher\n9:38\nmultiple for a more leveraged company.\n9:41\nUm as far as the value transfers go\n9:44\nit would be a strategic shift from\n9:46\nconservation to aggression and then any\n9:49\ngovernance any uh government concern\n9:53\ngovernance sorry um so a circular\n9:55\nincentive does exist. So if management\n9:58\nis paid in stock then the management\n9:59\ncould use that company to buy stock.\n10:01\nStock would go up and then management\n10:02\nwould get paid more. But this would\n10:04\nrequire um strict board oversight to\n10:05\nensure organic growth isn't neglected.\n10:09\nSo that sums up our first analysis.\n10:11\nLet's go ahead and look into capital\n10:12\nallocation next.\n10:14\nSo we're still under the same\n10:15\nassumptions for the buyback. Now we are\n10:17\nunder the assumption that the cost of\n10:18\ndebt is assumed um 4% fixed uh because\n10:22\nit's significantly below the cost of\n10:23\nequity. We see that the dividend uh the\n10:26\nspecial dividend of $6 a share uh the\n10:29\nearnings yield of 3.3%.\n10:32\nAnd then R&D is assumed capacity of $20\n10:35\nbillion a year for moonshots.\n10:38\nLet's go ahead and look at these\n10:39\nalternatives from the the buyback.\n10:42\nA good starting point would look at the\n10:43\nwould be the looking at the buyback. So\n10:45\nwe saw that it would have a positive\n10:46\nimpact and um the strategic fit is high\n10:49\nbecause returns excess capital and\n10:50\nsupports the price. But let's look at\n10:52\nthe uh special dividend. So if we did\n10:54\ndecide to go with a special dividend,\n10:56\nthe EPS impact would come out to be\n10:58\nneutral. It would be about 93 billion as\n11:00\nshown in our data.\n11:04\nUh this provides an immediate cash\n11:06\nreturn but it does signal low growth and\n11:09\nit is inefficient. It is inefficient for\n11:11\ntax taxable holders. So the fit would be\n11:14\nabout medium. And then uh acquiring like\n11:18\nan AI company, this would be a variable\n11:21\ncost of about 50 billion. will say that,\n11:23\nbut it could be likely dilutive, meaning\n11:25\nthat\n11:28\nit's very strategy dependent and depends\n11:30\non how you would use it. So, it's very\n11:32\nhigh risk and it's hard to find targets\n11:34\num moving the needle at this scale.\n11:37\nAnd if we wanted to pay down some debt,\n11:39\nwe could pay up to 110 billion. Um this\n11:42\nwould be good for us. Um\n11:46\nthe return would be low, but um the\n11:48\ncurrent and the current leverage is\n11:50\nmanageable. So the strategic fit would\n11:52\nbe low looking at that. Now looking at\n11:55\nincremental research and development um\n11:57\nit would also be dilutive\n12:00\nmeaning it wouldn't make the company as\n12:01\nwell. And as research and development is\n12:04\ncritical for sur for survival. I don't\n12:06\nthink it would be the best use of this\n12:07\nmoney in this scenario.\n12:09\nBut we can get a little visual here of\n12:11\nwhere everything fits. We can see on how\n12:13\nmuch money we would be spending on each\n12:15\ncast usage context shown right here.\n12:21\nUm,\n12:23\nit's good to see this visual to see how\n12:24\nthe money is being used. And\n12:28\nnow, let's dive into a little bit of a\n12:29\ndeeper dive into each.\n12:33\nWe already went through the share\n12:34\nrepurchase, so I'm not going to bore you\n12:35\nagain, but we're going to go through the\n12:37\nspecial dividend now. So, we said that\n12:39\nthe EPS impact would be neutral. There\n12:41\nwould be no ownership change, no change\n12:43\nin concentration. You're really just\n12:44\ngiving people money. That's what the uh\n12:46\ndividend is.\n12:48\num it's a immediate return on capital\n12:50\nand strategic fit would be weak because\n12:52\nit signals X growth\n12:55\num and offers no price support for the\n12:57\nemployee options. Now if we're looking\n12:59\nat the AI acquisition um high variance\n13:02\nas we talked about earlier um it has\n13:04\nhigh potential upside but\n13:07\nthere is a history of large scale tech\n13:09\nmergers and acquisitions is poor because\n13:11\ncultural class culture classes um often\n13:14\ndestroy value. So, I don't think we'll\n13:15\nbe looking too much into that one. As\n13:18\nfar as the debt reduction goes, this\n13:20\nwould be a little bit more of a lazy\n13:21\nfit. Um, as it would help out the\n13:23\ncompany. Um, it would have some low\n13:26\nreturn and I don't think we really need\n13:28\nit necessarily for this company. Uh,\n13:32\nlooking at incremental R&D, um, as we\n13:34\nsaid earlier, essential for survival\n13:36\nprobably not the best fit. There's no\n13:38\nchange in ownership. Um, no impact on\n13:40\ndebt really, but it does have the\n13:43\nhighest potential.\n13:44\nceiling, but also a high failure rate.\n13:46\nUsually with a high high rate of return,\n13:49\nthere's also a high rate of risk.\n13:53\nNow, if we wanted to compare,\n13:57\nwe can see that buybacks are the most\n13:59\nearnings per share accreive um accretive\n14:02\ntool um available because they directly\n14:04\nreduce the share count denominator,\n14:06\nwhich uh drives up the share value. Just\n14:08\nbasic math. Um tax efficiency. Buybacks\n14:11\nallow for tax deferral for continuing\n14:13\nshareholders because they don't trigger\n14:14\ntaxable distributation like uh dividends\n14:17\ndo. As far as the balance sheet goes,\n14:19\nthe debt reduction would be the safest.\n14:21\nAnd um a strategic trade-off\n14:25\nfor what um each one would offer,\n14:29\nbut let's um I had my AI rank these. So\n14:32\nwe went one with the uh buyback, two\n14:35\nwould be the incremental R&D, three\n14:37\nwould be the special dividend, four\n14:38\nwould be the debt payown, and then the\n14:39\nlast one would be the merge and\n14:40\nacquisition. So it recommends the $90\n14:43\nbillion share repurchase as an optimal\n14:45\nuse of capital. Um Apple generates more\n14:47\ncash than it efficiently reinvests in\n14:49\norganic growth. So a buyback provides\n14:51\ntax efficient returns to shareholders\n14:53\nbecause it avoids immediate t uh capital\n14:56\ngains taxes. So as said earlier, this\n14:59\nwould also push the earnings per share\n15:01\nup. So right now this does really seem\n15:02\nlike the best option for us. So let's go\n15:05\nahead and dive into the value analysis\n15:07\nnow. So we're under the key ass these\n15:10\nkey assumptions uh 3.1% float retired\n15:13\nfrom the buyback impact risk-free rate\n15:15\nassumed around 4%. Uh market valuation\n15:18\nabout 185 as given in the data. Agency\n15:22\nCEO holds uh 3 million shares\n15:26\nand the cost of equity is assumed to be\n15:28\ngreater than 3.3%.\n15:30\nsince that is our buyback yield.\n15:33\nSo now let's dive into this. So we're\n15:36\ngoing to dive into the genuine value\n15:38\ncreation. So,\n15:40\nso this kind of talks about what we\n15:42\ntalked about earlier, how\n15:45\nApple's cost of capital um must be\n15:47\nsignificantly below the 3.3% threshold\n15:50\num or the shares must be trading at well\n15:52\nbelow their intrinsic value because\n15:54\nrepurchasing uh the shares at this\n15:56\nmultiple um destroy shareholder value\n15:58\nbecause the company is exchanging $1 of\n16:00\nhard cash for less than a dollar of\n16:01\nintrinsic equity value.\n16:04\nSo this really just raises some\n16:05\nquestions of does this buyback really\n16:07\ncreate genuine value creation. Now\n16:10\nlooking into our strategic um research\n16:12\nand development and acquisition. So if\n16:14\nwe were obviously to go about this um\n16:19\nthe buyback would optimize the uh per\n16:21\nshare slice of the pie. Only successful\n16:23\num only a successful execution of the\n16:25\n$25 billion R&D budget or strategic\n16:28\nmerge and acquisition could grow the pie\n16:30\nitself. So in the long run, organic\n16:32\nreinvestment dominates financial\n16:34\nengineering because it creates new cash\n16:36\nflow streams and revenue rather than\n16:38\njust redistributing the new ones and\n16:40\ncreating a cycle.\n16:42\nI think this is also a good section\n16:43\nthough because it's really asking like\n16:45\nwhat are we doing for the company? If\n16:46\nwe're not researching and developing and\n16:48\nif we're not adding something else to\n16:49\nit, what are these buybacks really going\n16:50\nto optimize?\n16:53\nSo next we're going to look at some\n16:55\nvalue transfer mechanisms. So we'll\n16:57\nstart with the seller to holder\n16:58\narbitrage or arbitrage.\n17:01\nSo there is an arbitrage opportunity\n17:03\nhere. If the intrinsic value is greater\n17:05\nthan 185, the $90 billion buyback acts\n17:08\nas a wealth transfer from the selling\n17:10\nshareholders who exit too early um to\n17:12\ncontinuing shareholders uh because the\n17:14\nremaining shares claim a larger portion\n17:16\nof the undervalued assets. I think\n17:18\nthat's also pretty cool to see. Um now\n17:22\nuh the balance sheet efficiency which is\n17:24\nmainly the bond holder risk. So\n17:26\nutilizing 90 billion of the 165\n17:28\nliquidity buffer increases net leverage.\n17:31\nSo value is transferred from bond\n17:32\nholders who um lose collateral to equity\n17:36\nholders who gain that leverage because\n17:38\num the risk is because the risk of\n17:40\ninsolveny marginally increases.\n17:44\nThere's also a t a tax arbitrage\n17:46\nopportunity here. So the buyback allows\n17:48\ntaxable investors to defer capital gains\n17:50\nwhereas a special dividend forces an\n17:51\nimmediate taxable event. So, this\n17:53\nrepresents a transfer of value from the\n17:55\ntreasury to long-term shareholders\n17:56\nbecause taxes are delayed.\n18:01\nBut I wanted to show some visuals here\n18:03\nbefore we um moved on to agency and\n18:05\ngovernance risk. So, here's a quick\n18:08\nlittle structure fit. We can see how the\n18:10\npre-byback and post pyback for\n18:12\nBirkshshire really doesn't change it too\n18:14\nmuch, but as we said earlier, they might\n18:15\nwant to reallocate their portfolio if\n18:18\nthey think that that is too concentrated\n18:20\nfor them.\n18:21\nAnd then we can see the leverage profile\n18:23\nshift here. So we can see how once\n18:28\nwe go about the buyback, the equity risk\n18:30\nwould increase and the bond holder\n18:33\nprotection would decrease.\n18:37\nI think this is an awesome visual\n18:38\nbecause it kind of shows how uh we go\n18:41\nfrom no debt to being in debt.\n18:44\nSo,\n18:47\nbut um as seen down here, the buyback\n18:49\nconcentrates equity ownership and\n18:50\nlong-term holders like Birkshshire and\n18:52\nmanagement while mechanically shifting\n18:54\nthe capital structure from a defensive\n18:55\nnet cash position to a modest net debt\n18:57\nposition. This increased equity um\n18:59\nsensitivity to macro shocks because\n19:01\nleverage magnific uh magnifies uh\n19:04\noutcomes.\n19:06\nSo, leverage in this scenario would be\n19:07\nsomewhat good.\n19:10\nBut let's finish it up. Let's look at\n19:12\nthe agency and governance risks.\n19:14\nSo if we do go about the earnings per\n19:16\nshare engineering uh with the CEO\n19:18\nholding 3 million shares and\n19:19\ncompensation tied to performance\n19:20\ntargets, there is a rational incentive\n19:23\nto favor the buybacks. So reducing the\n19:26\nshare count mechanically boost the EPS.\n19:27\nWe know that. So\n19:30\nthis could potentially trigger bonus\n19:32\npayouts even if the net income is flat.\n19:36\nUh another risk we have to look at is\n19:37\nthe option overhang. So employee\n19:39\nretention relies on the options being in\n19:40\nthe money. Um with the strike at 170\n19:44\nwith the current price at 185 that\n19:46\nspread is very narrow only about $15. So\n19:49\nthe $90 billion buyback acts as a price\n19:51\nfloor because it absorbs all the supply\n19:53\nbut it defends the $170 level um and\n19:56\npreserves the value of the employee\n19:57\ncompensation.\n20:00\nUh we can talk a little bit about growth\n20:02\nmasking. So allocating 90% of the free\n20:04\ncash flow to the buyback signals a\n20:05\ntransition from the growth to a cash\n20:08\ncow. Um this implies management lacks\n20:10\nconfidence in internal projects to\n20:11\ngenerate returns above the cost of\n20:13\ncapital because they are choosing to\n20:14\nreturn capital rather than reinvest it\n20:16\nback into the company.\n20:20\nBut under these current assumptions,\n20:21\nwhat we really learned from this is that\n20:22\nthat this buyback is primarily a value\n20:24\ntransfer and preservation mech mechanism\n20:27\nrather than a massive value creation\n20:28\nevent. So it efficient efficiently\n20:31\nreturns excess capital and defends the\n20:33\nstock price for stakeholders. But\n20:34\nbecause of the rich valuation, it does\n20:36\nnot offer an asymmetric upside of early\n20:38\nstage repurchases. However, compared to\n20:40\nthe destruction of value through uh\n20:42\nfailed large largecale merchant\n20:44\nacquisitions or inefficient cash\n20:46\nhoarding, it remains prudent remains the\n20:48\nprudent allocation choice.\n20:52\nSo just from this, we are still favoring\n20:54\nthe buyback from our other op our other\n20:56\nalternatives.\n20:58\nSo before we move on to our signal um\n21:00\nour other section, I wanted to do a\n21:03\nquick sanity check about this part. So I\n21:06\nwanted to make sure that a buyback is\n21:07\nactually a value transfer and\n21:08\npreservation mechanism rather than a\n21:10\nmassive value creation event or if it's\n21:12\njust this specific scenario. So let's go\n21:15\nahead and um I plug that into chat GPT\n21:18\nwith um concise explanation on why and\n21:20\nrely on reliable sources. So it says yes\n21:24\nin most cases share back buybacks mainly\n21:26\ntransfer and preserve value rather than\n21:28\ncreate large amounts of new value uh\n21:30\nbecause the repurchase really just swaps\n21:32\ncash on balance sheets for fewer shares\n21:34\nu outstanding and true value creation\n21:37\nonly happens if the firm buys back stock\n21:39\nmeaningfully below their intrinsic\n21:41\nvalue.\n21:43\nSo it's good to know that we are on the\n21:45\nright track here.\n21:48\nAll right, we're going to go ahead and\n21:49\nuh dive into\n21:52\nwhat uh signals to look for um market\n21:54\nperceptions and capital disciplines for\n21:57\neach of our alternatives. We are under\n21:59\nthe assumption of the valuation signal\n22:01\nis a 30 times PE implies market\n22:03\nexpectations of a high growth or\n22:04\nstability. Market pre uh preference\n22:07\ninvestors currently favor cash return\n22:08\nover risky mergers and acquisitions.\n22:11\nCash availability 100 billion annual\n22:13\nfree cash flow. discipline management is\n22:15\nwilling to shrink the float rather than\n22:16\nan empire build and then the strategic\n22:20\ncontext organic growth has slowed.\n22:23\nSo let's start with the with the\n22:24\nbuyback. So what it's saying in general\n22:28\nis we generate more cash than we can\n22:31\nefficiently reinvest.\n22:34\nSo the signal for doing this buyback um\n22:36\nthe management believes that the stock\n22:37\nis undervalued or fairly valued um at\n22:39\nthis um price to earnings ratio uh\n22:42\nbecause they are buying it themselves.\n22:45\nIf confirmed that internal reinvestment\n22:47\ncannot observe the full or cannot absorb\n22:49\nthe full 100 billion um annual free cash\n22:52\nflow.\n22:54\nAs far as market perception goes, it\n22:55\nwould be seen as a a positive thing to\n22:57\ndo. Uh we've gone plenty into that, but\n23:00\nit's viewed into as a shareholder\n23:02\nfriendly discipline because it returns\n23:04\nexcess cash rather than wasting it.\n23:06\nCapital discipline must be high uh\n23:08\nprevents empire building. Management is\n23:10\nchoosing to return cash other than just\n23:12\nwasted on low uh return on invested\n23:14\ncapital acquisitions. Um just to show\n23:17\ntop of the line growth.\n23:20\nNext, let's look at the uh special\n23:21\ndividend. So the signaling effects that\n23:23\nwe're looking at um so implicit\n23:25\nadmission that the company has\n23:27\ntransitioned to utility phase rather\n23:28\nthan management\n23:31\nsorry let me let me uh backtrack um\n23:34\ntransition to a utility phase because\n23:36\nmanagement sees no better use for cash\n23:39\nuh but lacks conviction to retire the\n23:41\nshares. So basically they just wouldn't\n23:44\nbe convinced enough to buy back the\n23:45\nshares and rather just give the\n23:47\ninvestors money. um it would be seen as\n23:50\nmixed and mixed and neutral. Um and it\n23:52\nsignals not the best growth. Um but as\n23:56\nfar as capital discipline goes, it would\n23:58\nbe moderate. It avoids the bad spending,\n24:00\nbut it fails to compound capital and\n24:03\nit's a one-time sugar high rather than\n24:06\nuh structural optimization. And in\n24:08\ngeneral, it sums it up by saying the\n24:10\nhyperrowth era is effectively over. Here\n24:12\nis your cash for a debt payown. The\n24:14\nsignal that we're looking at is um ultra\n24:17\nlike being ultra-conservative. So\n24:19\nmanagement sees significant macro risk\n24:22\nin the market and it requires a fortress\n24:24\nbalance sheet. So we really need to amp\n24:26\nit up and\n24:28\nwe would um need to far exceed the\n24:31\ncurrent uh liquidity buffer. But market\n24:34\nperception it would be seen as negative.\n24:36\nIt would be seen as lazy capital paying\n24:37\ndown cheap de uh cheap debt.\n24:40\nUm and then capital discipline would be\n24:42\npoor because um suboptimal capital\n24:45\nstructure and it's just not needed in\n24:47\ngeneral. So to sum this up, we\n24:50\nprioritize extreme safety over balance\n24:52\nsheet efficiency. So\n24:55\nnext close look at the uh strategic\n24:59\nu acquisitions.\n25:01\nSo the signal effect we're looking at is\n25:03\na pivot to higher risk. So management\n25:06\nadmits that organic growth is infin um\n25:08\ninsufficient to justify the multiple and\n25:10\nis willing to pay a premium for external\n25:12\ntech.\n25:14\nSo we would really just need management\n25:16\nto be willing to have a need for AI in\n25:19\nthis case. But as far as market\n25:22\nperception goes, it would be kind of\n25:23\nskeptical because it's risky and if we\n25:25\ndid emerge acquisition um historically\n25:28\nfaces massive integration risk because\n25:30\nof culture clashes. And then this would\n25:32\nbe a low capital discipline because it\n25:34\noften suggests panic buying at market\n25:35\ntops and the risk of overpaying is high\n25:39\ncompared to just returning cash.\n25:42\nAnd that is summed up by saying we need\n25:43\nto buy innovation because internal\n25:45\nresearch and development is stalling.\n25:46\nNow that sums us or that puts us right\n25:48\ninto research and development. Our\n25:50\nsignal effect we're looking at is\n25:51\nconfidence. So a strong pipeline exists.\n25:54\nUm management is willing to sacrifice\n25:56\nshort-term margins because they believe\n25:58\nin long-term dominance. So they they see\n26:00\na reason to do this research and\n26:02\ndevelopment. The market perception would\n26:04\nbe volatile but hopeful. Obviously, you\n26:06\nknow, if it comes out successful, it\n26:07\ncould be great. If it fails, it could be\n26:08\nbad. Um the capital discipline would be\n26:11\nhigh if targeted. True discipline in\n26:13\ninvesting in a business first. Um and\n26:15\nthen returning capital should only\n26:16\nhappen after um all the high return on\n26:18\ninvested capital ideas are funded. So\n26:21\nthese two are the only one with high\n26:22\ncapital discipline. So I think those are\n26:23\nthe two that we should narrow it down to\n26:26\nalong with keeping special dividend in\n26:28\nmind. But I really do think that the\n26:30\nbuyback is the best option for this.\n26:33\nWe're going to look at our investment\n26:34\nrating here. So\n26:36\nwhat we uh finally came up with after\n26:38\nall this analysis is that we reaffirm\n26:40\nthat our um overweight waiting rating is\n26:44\ncorrect and we recommend voting for the\n26:46\n$90 billion share repurchase the\n26:48\nbuyback. So with the shares trading at\n26:51\n30 price to earnings ratio uh the\n26:54\nbusiness is d um generating 100 billion\n26:56\nin free cash flow. Apple produces far\n26:58\nmore liquidity than it can um\n27:00\nefficiently deploy into organic research\n27:01\nand development. So the buyback acts as\n27:04\na discipline release valve because it\n27:06\nprevents the empire building that we are\n27:08\nworried about and it optimizes the\n27:10\ncapital structure by reducing the net\n27:12\ncash drag.\n27:16\nAnd then we already know um about the uh\n27:18\nlarge scale acquisitions and the debt\n27:20\npayown wouldn't be as efficient\n27:23\nand the special dividends would lack the\n27:25\ntax efficiency um and the compounding\n27:27\nbenefits of the buyback program.\n27:29\nSo I think that this does make sense for\n27:31\nour analysis and everything that we have\n27:33\nseen um up to this point. I think that\n27:36\nthis would also be a good time for\n27:37\nanother sanity check. So, I went ahead\n27:39\nand did some research about um Apple's\n27:41\nbuybacks and if they are actually going\n27:44\nabout buybacks, if they do them um as a\n27:46\ncompany, and what I found was that they\n27:49\nhave done significant buybacks. Um as we\n27:52\ncan see here, their buybacks are going\n27:54\ndown, their shares outstanding or sorry,\n27:56\ntheir shares outstanding are going down\n27:58\nand their buybacks are going up. So, I\n28:00\nwould say in general that this analysis\n28:02\nmakes plenty of sense and it passes the\n28:05\nsanity check for my books. All\n28:08\nright. So, I'm going to wrap us up now\n28:10\nwith uh the reflect. Um the first\n28:13\nquestion that I wanted to answer is what\n28:14\nis my biggest takeaway from this\n28:16\nassignment.\n28:17\nUm I think that I learned um a lot from\n28:20\nthis assignment. Um I learned more about\n28:22\nbuybacks and the uh other alternatives\n28:24\nto them. I also learned about signaling\n28:27\ntheories to the buyback decision. Um I\n28:29\nalso learned more about leverage. I did\n28:31\na little more research about that when I\n28:33\nwas confused earlier.\n28:35\nIt was also kind of cool to see all the\n28:37\ndifferent types of investors and how\n28:38\nthey're affected. Um like how the bond\n28:40\nholders were affected differently than\n28:41\nthe shareholders. Um I haven't gotten\n28:43\ntoo much exposure to that. So that was\n28:45\ndefinitely helpful to see. The second\n28:46\nquestion that I wanted to answer is uh\n28:49\nwhat did I actually learn? Um I really\n28:52\nlearned how to use AI Google Studio\n28:53\nbetter. Um I do think that this is one\n28:55\nof my better projects that I made with\n28:57\nit. Uh very proud of how it came out.\n29:00\nUm,\n29:02\nuh, before I end, I wanted to go through\n29:04\nmy Gemini logs real quick, um, for, uh,\n29:07\neach prompt. So, I was very descriptive\n29:10\nwith each and I wanted to make sure it\n29:11\nwas studentfriendly so I could have a\n29:13\nbetter explanation for when I was making\n29:15\nthe video.\n29:16\nUm, same thing for each tab.\n29:21\nUh, made it all super detailed um, on\n29:23\npurpose. I worked with Chat GPT to make\n29:26\nthese prompts even better. Um, I started\n29:28\nwith the original prompt and asked it\n29:30\nwhat I could add on to make it better\n29:32\nand really bring this analysis to the\n29:34\nnext level.\n29:38\nBut that wraps up um, assignment 11.\n29:41\nThank you."
