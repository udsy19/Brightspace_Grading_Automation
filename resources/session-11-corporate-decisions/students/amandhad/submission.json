  "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Anvita and in this video I will walk through my full driver analysis for Apple's proposed $90 billion share repurchase. So I'll be running my Python model on my screen as I narrate and so you will see each of the driver stage printed out in real time and my goal is to compress the buyback against four alternative uses of capital. Understand the impact of different stakeholders. Identify which strategy creates the most long-term shareholder value shareholder value while addressing incentives and governance concerns. So here we're going to go ahead and run the first cell. So this has this go aheads and imports all the libraries and defines the full driver analyst class. And so once it's done loading, we're going to go to the bottom where I can go ahead and start with the execution. Um so this is kind of where the execution block begins. And so here we have our driver stage start. Um and so here we have our first um part of the driver which is define. And so the define function essentially it go aheads and prints out the core problem statement. So this stage stops me from jumping right into the calculations and before I would know what the problem is that I'm solving um it's very easy to focus on the EPS that increases from the buyback. But that approach ignores the stakeholder incentives, the agency risks and the long-term value creation. So the real question documented here is what capital allocation strategy best maximizes the long-term shareholder value while balancing incentives and avoiding misaligned decisions. So, by stating this clearly, I satisfy the first driver requirement of having an intentional and correct problem before going to solving. And I don't know if you noticed, but I believe this is Chinese if I'm not mistaken, but there is some another language that's here. And I didn't want to remove this because my professor is the one who created this driver framework. And I believe in the article that he had sent for us as a gift. Um there was some characters in another language. So I wanted to keep them here as well. But yes, going into the represent stage next. So this section, it lays out the structure and the assumptions that shape the entire model. So I can see that the Apple's base net income of $95 billion and the base EPS a little over $6 and the initial debt to equity ratio and the buyback execution um price which includes a 5% premium and so the represent also shows the assumed earnings yield for the acquisition scenario the cost of debt and the expected rate on return um the expected return on R and the D and the tax rate. So the purpose of represent is to make sure that the structure is visible so that I can share how shares, earnings, leverage and value creation connect. And so with these relationships documented, the model can be executed clearly and consistently. Next going into the implementation stage, this is where the model calculates the outcomes of the five capital allocation scenarios. And as the table loads later on, you can see the results for the buyback, the dividend, the acquisition, the debt reduction, and the R&D. So under the buyback scenario, we have shares that outstanding fall sharply and the EPS rises. And if the back buy is partially debt financed, leverage becomes worse. The dividend scenario keeps EPS unchanged and does not create long-term value. The acquisition scenario generates actual value creation by increasing net income based on the assume assumed yield and the debt reduction strengthens the balance sheet and significantly lowers leverage which benefits bond holders and reduces financial risk. The R&D scenario increases long-term earnings based on the 15% ROI. the implementation stage which shows scenarios create value which simply transfer it and it also assumes um and it also um creates assumptions that collide with real numbers and that's the heart of the discipline and so now at the end of the implement stage right over here um we can see that the model calculates how each of the scenario affects the stakeholders. I can come a little higher. And so we can see how each scenario affects the stakeholders. So the output captures Birkshire Hathaway's ownership concentration after the buyback, the CEO's gain from a higher share price and the improvement in the value of employee stock options. So the bond holder risk is visible through the stage in the debt to equity ratio and these numbers show which groups benefit, which groups are exposed to risk and how incentives shape capital allocation decisions. This assignment requires stakeholder analysis and this section integrates it into the model. Now if I just keep scrolling down and I get to the validate stage. So here is where I run the different validation tests. So the model checks how sensitive the results are to the changes and the key assumptions. So the first test uses a worst case buyback execution price of $25 and the output shows the number of shares repurchased drop significantly and the EPS increase becomes smaller. So this confirms that buybacks are very sensitive to disciplined execution. The second test eval evaluates R and D at a 5% ROI. EPS still rises and at a much slower rate. These tests help me avoid false confidence and reveal how fragile or resilient each strategy is when it comes to the assumption stage. Now go getting into evolve. Next is the evolve stage. And so this prints a hybrid strategy. So instead of viewing each strategy or each scenario as an isolated choice, evolve asks what an improved forward-looking allocation could be. So the hybrid plan allocates $45 billion toward growth investments such as acquisitions and R&D, $35 billion to a smaller buyback and $10 billion to a debt reduction. So this approach balances value creation, shareholder signaling and financial discipline. Evolve shifts the goal from selecting a single option to designing a sustainable long-term capital allocation plan. Now getting into the reflect part of the driver stage. This prints the conclusion and the stakeholder impact. So, this model recommends rejecting the full $90 billion buyback and adopting a hybrid strategy of $45 billion for growth, $35 billion for buybacks, and 10 billion for debt reduction. So, this output highlights the CEO's personal gain from an EPS-based price increase. Birkshere's ownership concentration change and the improvement in leverage under debt reduction. So reflex summarizes the lessons from the analysis and the key principles are to prioritize real value creation, avoid relying on EPS as a signal of health and balance incentives across all stakeholders.\nAnd now finally getting into the execution part and the parameterization. So to satisfy the technical requirement of the scenario toggles, I now run an ad hoc scenario where the buyback premium is 10% and 50% of the repurchase is debt funded. So when the updated results print, which you can see here, um you're able to see the effects clearly. So the EPS is weaker, the post buyback is lower, and the debt to equity ratio worsens. This demonstrates the flexibility of a model and how quickly buyback economics can deteriorate when execute conditions shift. And so here is the rest of my output as well along with the driver framework. And so this completes the full driver workflow. And you have now seen my define, my represent, my implement, my validate, my evolve and reflect executed in order which printed clearly on the screen. Working through a framework has helped me avoid the problem of the wrong of getting the wrong problem first, building the right structure and testing scenarios realistically. It also challenged my assumptions that I initially had and helped me to design a forward-looking strategy and convert the entire process into a defensible recommendation. So, I had a lot of fun in this class and I think I've definitely learned so much using the driver framework and I'm hoping to use it in the future as well. Just to reiterate kind of what I've previously talked about here. Um, so we have like the defined stage. So I have my problem statement and my goal defined in my represent. I have some of the baseline information noted here. So these are key assumptions and the base metrics as well. Things like net income, the base EPS, the base de ratio, the assumed buyback price and the acquisition proxy. In my implementation stage, I go ahead and execute the model. So I have a quantitative scenario comparison looking at the different core core metrics and then I have my validate stage and this is the different sensitivity testing that I'm doing. So I'm validating the test results. I'm looking at the R&D tests as well. Um and then I have my evolve stage. So I'm synthesizing the optimal strategy and figuring out what is best. So we're looking at different robust strategies that are able to maximize the value creation but also manage the expectations. And so here is when we kind of define the hybrid allocation being the best type of model to use. And then finally we have the reflect stage. And so this is where we have um the justification as to why we picked what we picked. And then lastly is the parameterization that I was previously talking about. And so this shows the different um scenarios and then we're going to just compare them. It's the quantitative scenario comparison table. And so this shows the core metrics and kind of compares everything together. So thank you so much for watching. Thoroughly enjoy this class and I'm excited to use all these skills in the future as well."
