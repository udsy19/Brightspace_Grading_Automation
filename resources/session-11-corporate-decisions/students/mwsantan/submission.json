  "transcript": "Okay.\nUm, so this uh session is for I'm trying\nto evaluate Apple's hypothetical $90\nbillion\ncapital allocation decision using the\ndriver framework. My goal is to\nrecommend the optimal strategy that\nbalances shareholder return, strategic\ngrowth and stakeholder incentives. Uh\nthe analysis of course bins begins with\ndefining and discovering meeting the\nwhich is meeting the critical critical\ngate requirement. So we established a\nbaseline of $180 share price 15.5\nbillion shares outstanding and the high\nliquidity.\nOur analysis will compare the are the\nproposed buyback against the distinct\nalternatives. As you can see you can see\nthat 185 share price and the 15.5\nbillion shares outstanding right here.\nUm\nso to the represent stage involved\nbuilding a transparent Python model to\nexecute our analysis and of course I use\nGemini and Python to help me do this.\nThis fulfills the technical or um sorry\nthe models are reproducible calculations\nare built upon a clearly surfaced\nassumptions such as a $15 percentage\nincremental ROIC for investments and a\nsimplified $8 percentage WACC.\nThe model automates the calculations\nacross all five scenarios demonstrating\nthe scenario capability required.\nThe EPS earnings per share measures\nshort-term creation and management\nincentives. The ROIC, which is return on\ninvested cap capital, measures long-term\nefficiency and potential value for uh\ncreation. And net debt uh measures\nleverage and financial risk\nand I want to transition.\nAnd uh one thing I really like that uh\nGemini did on this Python code is they\nadded scenarios to allow for better\ncalculations. understanding of what's\ngoing on for this hypothetical situation\nfor Apple.\nUm, but I want to transition to my graph\nhere.\nThere we go.\nUm,\nso the the analysis of value creation\nversus transfer is central. The model\nthis model classifies the acquisition\nR&D as potential value creation. Their\nmodeled $22.08\n08 percentage ROIC significantly exceeds\nthe $8 percentage WACC which is\nindicating a positive net worth net\npresent value if successful. The buyback\ndividend and debt reduction are value\ntransfer mechanisms. The buyback is an\nefficient transfer of value of from the\ncompany to the remaining shareholders\nvia ownership and concentration.\nSo we now we we look at how the buyback\naffects uh stakeholders institutional\nholders which they have they are a key\nstakeholder like the Birkshshire\nHathaway benefits from the signaling of\nconfidence and the resulting of\nconcentration of their equity ownership\nincreasing their influence for\nmanagement the 3.24%age 24 percentage\nEPS boost from the buyback directly\naligns with their performance targets\nwhich represents a clear agency co cost\nconcern. The risk of prioritizing share\nbuybacks over higher NPV strategic\ninvestments. The bond holders they're\nthe best served by debt reduction which\ncauses a significant drop in the net\ndebt and lowers their financial risk.\nAnd this comparison shows that while the\nbuyback is is strong on signaling\nconfidence and short-term EPS is it is\nstrategically deficient compared to the\nlong-term potential R&D acquisition.\nSo my recom for my recommendation the\nposession the progression through the uh\ndriver leads us to the evolve stage\nwhich a sole 90 billion buyback is\nfiscally conservative but fails to\nleverage Apple's full potential\nand in reflection the optimal strategy\nstrategy is a balanced approach that\naddresses short-term both short-term\nfinancial discipline and long-term\nstrategic fit I recommend a hybrid\ncapital allocation plan such as like 45\nbillion to share repurchase this fulfill\nfills the short-term market expectation\nprovides immediate EPS assert assertion\nand signals financial health and or 45\nbillion to incremental R&D. This commits\ncapital to value uh creation and\nmitigates the highest agency risk by\ndedicating resources to strategic\nlong-term growth justifying the high\nvaluation. This recommendation\nuh is data driven. We pulled it from the\nassignment articulate stakeholder\ntrade-offs and provides a balanced\ncoverage of financial and strategic\nconsiderations.\nAnd again, I'm super glad that we're\nable to provide a graph that shows all\nthese numbers in the table to help me\nsee um the EPS impact percentage\nrelative up to baseline. But yeah,\nthat's my assignment and thank you"
