  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Sandy Skinner, and this\n0:02\nis my session 11 assignment.\n0:03\nSo here we are looking to evaluate\n0:06\nApple's hypothetical $90\n0:07\nbillion stock buyback using Driver.\n0:10\nSo to start off with the Define and\n0:12\nDiscover stage, why would Apple\n0:14\nexactly want to do a stock buyback?\n0:16\nWell, Apple generates so much cash that\n0:18\nthey have so much excess cash, it doesn't\n0:20\nmake sense to hold on to all of it.\n0:22\nSo by doing a buyback, what they can do\n0:24\nis actually give that excess cash back\n0:27\nto shareholders by diluting those shares\n0:29\nand giving back to these shareholders.\n0:33\nAnd it makes more sense than, for example,\n0:36\npaying dividends to your shareholders\n0:37\nwith all that excess cash because\n0:39\nyou don't have to pay taxes on it until\n0:40\npeople actually sell their stock.\n0:43\nSo first thing I did is I went in here and\n0:46\nstored all of my data for the cash flows.\n0:50\nTo start off, we can see we have cash\n0:53\ninvestments, annual free cash flow,\n0:54\ncurrent share price, all this good stuff.\n0:58\nand wanted to calculate the pre-buyback\n1:01\nmetrics so we can see that the pre-buyback\n1:04\nfinancial metrics they have a market cap of 2\n1:06\n,867 billion or 2.8 trillion dollars an\n1:12\nimplied net income of 95.58 billion and an\n1:16\nearnings per share of 6 .17 billion or six dollars\n1:20\nand 17 cents however after the stock\n1:23\nbuyback, what they actually do with the $90\n1:26\nbillion is they repurchase half a billion\n1:29\nshares, which lowers the new shares outstanding\n1:32\nfrom $15.5 billion to $15.01 billion, and\n1:36\ncreate a new earnings per share of $6.37,\n1:39\ngiving a lot of money back to the shareholders.\n1:41\nSo the cash investments goes to $75\n1:44\nbillion, the new retained earnings is $10\n1:45\nbillion, the new debt per equity ratio is now\n1:48\n11 and the new debt to cash ratio is 1.47.\n1:56\nSo the main difference here is cash and\n2:00\ninvestments obviously goes down by that 90 billion\n2:02\nretained earnings goes down by that much\n2:05\ntoo and that debt per equity ratio is going\n2:08\nto rise up a lot same with the debt to cash\n2:09\nratio but earnings per share is also going\n2:12\nto go up a big percentage meaning that\n2:14\nshareholders are going to get a lot of their\n2:15\nmoney back, and Apple now does not have too\n2:18\nmuch excess cash. They have enough to stay\n2:21\nafloat, obviously, with $75 billion, but not\n2:24\nso much that it doesn't make sense to have.\n2:28\nNow, moving on to stakeholder ownership,\n2:31\nwe can see that the initial institutional\n2:34\nshares and the initial retail ownership\n2:36\npercentage, it changes a lot, and the initial\n2:41\nBerkshire Hathaway ownership goes from 6%\n2:44\nto 6.19% meaning that that company will be\n2:47\nvery happy as they are now making even more\n2:50\nmoney and the initial retail ownership\n2:53\ngoes from 94% to 97 .05% meaning that a lot\n2:58\nof individual investors will also get paid\n3:00\nout whereas money managers professionally\n3:03\nlike hedge funds all that sort of stuff\n3:05\nwill get their shares diluted and individuals\n3:08\nwill now make a lot more money, meaning\n3:11\nthat there will be much more happening in\n3:12\nthe company, and Berkshire Hathaway will\n3:14\nalso be much more happening in the company as\n3:16\nthey are a huge owner of Apple's shares.\n3:20\nNow, moving on to the special dividend\n3:22\nscenario and some additionally alternative\n3:25\nscenarios. For the first one we want to\n3:27\nlook at, we want to look at the special\n3:28\ndividend scenario, which will have the same\n3:30\nimpact on cash and retained earnings\n3:32\nas they are spending a lot of their cash\n3:34\nand those retained earnings and reinvesting\n3:37\nthem by paying dividends to their\n3:39\nshareholders, which provides immediate cash\n3:41\nreturn and signals financial strength, but\n3:43\nreduces funds available for investment.\n3:47\nHowever, the impact on shares outstanding\n3:49\nwill stay the same, and the earnings per share\n3:51\nwill also stay the same. So a big difference\n3:54\nbetween the dividends and the stock\n3:57\nbuyback is that earnings per share will not go\n3:59\nup, giving stock buybacks a better advantage,\n4:03\nand taxes will not have to be paid on the\n4:05\nstock buyback, but they will on dividends.\n4:10\nNow, moving on to an AR\n4:13\n-VR acquisition scenario,\n4:15\ncash will obviously go down a lot as well.\n4:18\nHowever, assets will actually increase\n4:21\non the balance sheet because of the\n4:22\nacquired company's assets. You acquire\n4:25\nthe company, that is now an asset.\n4:27\nThere's potential for a huge long-term\n4:29\nincrease in revenues and earnings, which will\n4:31\nmake shareholders very happy if the\n4:33\nacquisition is successful and integrates well.\n4:35\nHowever, it also adds some extreme\n4:37\nvolatility, as if the company fails, that could\n4:39\nbe not only a bad investment, but also\n4:43\npotentially lose money. So it could lead to\n4:46\na long-term premium in valuation, multiplies\n4:49\nif the acquisition position apples\n4:51\nstrongly in a high growth sector, but if it\n4:55\nfails, then that's a lot more risky than\n4:57\nsimply buying back some stock and investing\n5:00\nin the company rather than another company.\n5:03\nNext, moving on to the debt reduction scenario,\n5:06\nthis would decrease cash and investments\n5:08\nby as much debt as you repay, which would\n5:10\nmake the company a lot more financially\n5:13\nstable. But when you have a company as\n5:15\nfinancially stable as Apple, this doesn't necessarily\n5:17\nmake as much sense as you sort of want\n5:20\nthat leverage. You want to have the\n5:23\nopportunity to have those even larger gains and\n5:26\nyou have so much money that it doesn't\n5:28\nnecessarily matter if you're reducing debt because\n5:31\nthat debt will always be able to be\n5:33\nreduced. So it reduces financial risk, which\n5:37\ncan potentially improve credit rating and\n5:39\nlower future borrowing costs. But when you\n5:41\nhave a company such as Apple, the main thing\n5:42\nyou want to do is keep expanding and use your\n5:45\nleverage to your advantage. And by lowering\n5:48\nleverage ratios such as debt per equity,\n5:50\nyou essentially lower that possibility for\n5:54\nincreasing your revenue by a lot and lastly\n5:58\nmoving on to R&D this will obviously impact\n6:01\ncash and decrease cash investments just\n6:03\nlike everything else and is similar to the\n6:05\nAI VR acquisition scenario in the fact that\n6:08\nif research goes well you can make a ton\n6:11\nof money however if it doesn't go well you\n6:14\nmight not have that money you might not make\n6:17\na lot of money in the long run and it might\n6:19\nbe all for nothing so it's definitely more\n6:21\nvolatile than just buying back stock and\n6:25\ndepends on if apple wants to sort of take\n6:28\nthat risk into the r&d expenditure with\n6:30\nthat 90 billion or just buy back stock and\n6:33\nmaybe invest a little less cash into r&d\n6:36\nas it is definitely a huge and good thing\n6:38\nto do as a company as there's so much\n6:40\npotential for growth and it's within your own\n6:42\ncompany that that growth is happening\n6:44\nhowever stock buybacks are guaranteed to\n6:47\nhelp out your shareholders while not necessarily\n6:51\nhaving so much volatility involved.\n6:54\nNow to look at how each type of\n6:56\nshareholder will have an impact with\n6:58\nthis $90 billion share repurchase.\n7:01\nRetail investors, they will have higher\n7:03\nownership concentration and earnings\n7:05\nper share enhancement and indirect\n7:07\nprice support, meaning they own a bigger\n7:10\npart of the company, which means that\n7:12\nthey will obviously be happier. If Apple\n7:14\ndoes well, they'll make more money.\n7:16\nInstitutional investors will also have an\n7:18\nincreased concentration in the earnings per\n7:20\nshare enhancement, which means that they own\n7:23\na bigger piece of the pie, right? They'll\n7:25\nmake more money. It's always a good thing.\n7:27\nEmployees with stock options will have\n7:29\nincreased value potential as their outstanding\n7:32\nstock options benefit from a higher\n7:34\nstock price, and they may be more motivated\n7:36\nbecause they're incentivized by these\n7:38\nrising stock prices, and a successful buyback\n7:40\nprogram can reinforce its motivation.\n7:42\nAnd the CEO, as a significant shareholder,\n7:45\ndirectly benefits from any increase in share\n7:46\nprice and earnings per share. They may receive\n7:49\nperformance-based compensation, so\n7:52\ndefinitely a good thing for all of those shareholders.\n7:54\nNow looking at the alternative impacts,\n7:57\nretail and institutional investors receive\n8:00\nimmediate cash, which is a direct, tangible\n8:02\nreturn on investment, but the stock price\n8:04\nis typically adjusted down by the dividend\n8:06\namount on the ex-dividend date. This is bad\n8:08\nfor employees with stock options as the stock\n8:11\nprice typically drops by the dividend amount,\n8:13\nwhich reduces the intrinsic value of the\n8:15\nin-the-money options, and the CEO, the direct\n8:18\nvalue of their options, would decrease.\n8:20\nHowever, it demonstrates a commitment to\n8:22\nreturning capital to shareholders, which might\n8:23\nbe a good thing. For the AI-VR acquisition,\n8:26\nthere's potential for long-term\n8:28\ngrowth and innovation for retail\n8:29\ninstitution investors, but they're\n8:31\nnot receiving that immediate cash.\n8:32\nEmployees with stock options, they\n8:34\nshould be positive if the acquisition is\n8:35\nsuccessful and the significant growth.\n8:37\nAnd same for the CEO.\n8:38\nFor the debt reduction, retail and\n8:41\ninstitutional investors receive no immediate cash\n8:43\nbut benefit from reduced financial risk.\n8:45\nEmployees of stock option are now part of a\n8:48\nmore financially stable company, which is\n8:50\na good thing. And the CEO improves the company's\n8:52\nbalance sheet health and reduces interest\n8:53\nexpenses. And for incremental R&D, very\n8:56\nsimilar to the AI slash VR acquisition,\n8:58\nthere's potential for significant long-term\n9:01\ngrowth in terms of retail and institutional\n9:03\ninvestors, which gives them a chance to make a\n9:04\nlot of money. Employees with stock options,\n9:06\nfor them who are doing that R&D, they get\n9:11\nto be involved, and if they have successful\n9:14\ninnovation, potentially get a raise, so\n9:15\nthat's very good for them. And the CEO, this\n9:18\nreflects a long-term vision and commitment to\n9:19\ninnovation, which strengthens the company's\n9:21\nmarket position and drives future growth.\n9:24\nNext, moving on to whether this stock buyback\n9:27\ncreates value or simply transfers it. So\n9:30\nto start off, value creation refers to\n9:32\ncorporate actions that generate new economic\n9:33\nbenefits for the company and shareholders,\n9:35\nultimately increasing the firm's intrinsic\n9:37\nworth, while value transfer simply\n9:39\nrefers to corporate actions that\n9:41\nredistribute existing value among different\n9:43\nclasses of stakeholders without necessarily\n9:44\nincreasing that intrinsic value.\n9:46\nSo, to look at the mechanism of the transfer,\n9:51\nvalue is transferred from the company's\n9:52\ncash reserves and, by extension, from all\n9:54\nremaining shareholders to the shareholders\n9:55\nwho sell their shares back to the company.\n9:58\nCash that would have been used for other\n9:59\npurposes is instead used to reduce share\n10:01\ncount now justification that this does in\n10:05\nfact enhance value and doesn't um not\n10:09\nnecessarily create it uh earnings per share goes\n10:12\nup which means each share is more valuable\n10:15\nas it represents a larger claim on the\n10:16\ncompany's earnings a buyback can signal\n10:19\nmanagement belief that the stock is undervalued\n10:21\npotentially boosting their inner investor\n10:22\nconfidence they'll have a high return on\n10:24\ncapital if they believe that investing in\n10:26\nits own stock has a better return than any\n10:28\nother available investment opportunities,\n10:30\nand remaining shareholders will see an\n10:31\nincrease in their proportional ownership and\n10:33\nearnings per share, which is good for them.\n10:35\nNow, special dividends are certainly\n10:37\nvalue transfer as they simply\n10:39\njust transfer money to shareholders.\n10:42\nAI slash VR acquisition has potential for\n10:45\nvalue creation, but also significant risk\n10:47\nof value destruction as there's a possibility\n10:51\nfor them to gain a lot of money from, but\n10:53\nalso possibility to lose a lot of money.\n10:55\nDebt reduction is certainly value transfer\n10:57\nbecause it reduces financial risk, but can\n10:59\nlead to value enhancement. And incremental\n11:02\nR&D has the strongest potential for value\n11:04\ncreation, as if they find something new,\n11:06\nthen they create value from that new sector.\n11:09\nNow, the highest potential for creating\n11:13\ngenuine long-term value is definitely the\n11:14\nincremental R&D and a well-executed AI slash\n11:16\nVR acquisition, as these actions aim to\n11:19\nexpand the company's capabilities, innovate,\n11:20\nand tap into new markets, which grows the\n11:22\noverall economic pie. However, the $90 billion\n11:24\nshare repurchase and a special dividend\n11:26\nare primary mechanisms for value transfer,\n11:29\nbut if they believe that the investment\n11:31\nin the buyback is the best possible investment\n11:35\nopportunity at the time, it can create\n11:37\nvalue if their company continues to grow.\n11:40\nLastly, to look at agency considerations,\n11:43\nthey significantly influence this buyback\n11:46\ndecision as the incentive strikes for\n11:48\nmanagement, particularly through stock options,\n11:50\nvalued at $45 million in EPS-linked\n11:53\ncompensation creates a strong bias towards\n11:55\nshare buybacks due to their immediate\n11:57\npositive impact on per -share metrics in the\n11:59\nstock price, and this bias can lead to\n12:01\ncapital allocation decisions that prioritize\n12:03\nshort-term metric enhancement over\n12:05\nrisk reduction or potentially higher value\n12:07\nbut riskier long-term growth investments.\n12:09\nRobust board oversight is certainly\n12:11\ncritical to mitigate these agency risks.\n12:15\nPeople want to invest in their own company,\n12:17\nand that bias is definitely a huge\n12:19\nfactor in decisions that companies make,\n12:23\nso it's important to make the best decision\n12:24\nfor your company without this bias.\n12:27\nAnd as an overall summary, the substantial\n12:30\nincrease in financial leverage from debt\n12:33\nto equity rising from 1.1 to 11 and\n12:37\nreduction in liquidity post-buyback, management\n12:39\nshould certainly consider dedicating a\n12:41\nportion of its capital to debt reduction\n12:42\nto strengthen its balance sheet and improve\n12:45\nfinancial flexibility, especially in a\n12:47\npotentially volatile economic environment.\n12:49\nBut having good leverage is also very\n12:51\nimportant as it can lead to massive future\n12:56\npotential growth and gives them a much higher\n12:59\nchance and money to make that happen.\n13:02\nTo reflect, I found it very interesting\n13:05\nlooking at how everyone's decisions are weighed\n13:09\nand how companies have to balance what\n13:13\neverybody wants from shareholders to the\n13:15\nCEO to employees, and it's not just about\n13:19\nthe best decision in terms of money. You\n13:20\nhave to balance everything out and make sure\n13:24\nthat everyone who's invested in the company\n13:25\nand everyone who has a job at the company\n13:30\nhas an equal say and decision-making\n13:34\ncapabilities so that the company can make\n13:37\nthe best decision. Thank you for listening."
