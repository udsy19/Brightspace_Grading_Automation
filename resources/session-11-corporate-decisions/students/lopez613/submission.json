  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Damian\nLopez, and this is my session\n11 assignment. It is a corporate financial\ndecision analysis. We're going to evaluate\nthe Apple's $90 billion share repurchase\nusing the driver framework. I am going\nto act as an independent analyst, determining\nwhether the buyback creates value\nversus transfer value, while balancing\nstakeholder incentives and alternative\nuses of cash. First, I'll begin with\ndefine and discover. The decision question is simple, but high stakes. the decision question\nis simple does a 90 billion dollar buyback\ncreate value relative to other uses of cash\nor does it mainly transfer value between\nstakeholders here's the financial context\nApple has hundreds of 165 billion\ndollars in cash and investments and\ngenerates about a hundred billion in\nannual free cash flow. The stock trades at\n$185 with a PE of 30 and there are 15.5 billion\nshares outstanding. The balance sheet\nincludes $110 billion of debt and the\nkey stakeholders that matter here are that\nBerkshire Hathaway owns 6%. The CEO holds\n3 million shares. Retail investors\naverage 100 shares, and employees hold\noptions with a $170 strike price. The\nproposal is a $90 billion buyback\nexecuted over one year, roughly 10% of market\ncapitalization. The alternatives\nare a $6 special dividend strategic\nAI, or VR acquisition, debt reduction, or\nincremental R&D. The alternatives,\nmy decision criteria are four things. One, per share value\ncreation. Two, opportunity cost. Three, balance\nsheet resilience. And four,\nagency alignment across stakeholders. Next, in the driver\nframework, R, represent I built a transparent,\nparameterized model that allows\nme to toggle buyback size, execution\nprice, financing mix, and alternative\nuses of cash. This model automatically calculates shares\nrepurchased, post-transaction\nshare count, earnings per share,\nimplied share price under a\nconstant multiple, net cash versus net\ndebt, and ownership concentration for\nmajor stakeholders importantly I separate\nthe value creation from value transfer\na higher earnings per shares does not\nautomatically mean value creation and\nwith the structure defined I move to\nimplementation now I'll implement the\nbuyback the proposed buyback at a 185 dollars\nshare price a 90 billion dollar repurchase\nretires approximately 486 million shares\nthese shares outstanding fall from 15.5 billion\nto roughly 15 billion the baseline earnings\nper share is roughly six six dollars and\n17 cents and after the buyback the earnings per\nshares rises to roughly six dollars and 37\ncents which is a which is roughly a increase\nof over three percent if the market\napplies these same pme of 30 the implied\nshare price increases from 185 to about\n199 91 mechanically the math works but\nvalley creation depends on what\nhappens next and especially to the\nbalance sheet the visualization here shows the earnings per share before and after\nthe buyback the lift is real it's modest but it is real this\nis our first signal that most of the\nbenefits come from the share count reduction\nwhich is not from improving apple's\nunderlying business this chart the scatter\nchart is critical it is a Berkshire ownership\nversus net cash chart scatter plot scatter\nplot chart on the horizontal axis is net\ncash and on the vertical axis is Berkshire\nHathaway's ownership percentage after the\nbuyback Berkshire's Berkshire ownership\nrises slightly above 6% even\nthough it does nothing and\nafter the buyback then it gains\nconcentration which is not new value creation. At\nthe same time Apple's balance sheet becomes\nmore leveraged and this chart\nvisually captures the difference between\nvalue transfer and value creation now now I'll\ncompare the alternatives using the same 90\nbillion dollars the six-star special\ndividend distributes cash directly but it\ndoes not improve the per owners per share\nownership the debt reduction lowers the\nrisk it strengthens the resilience and it\ncan create value if market markets reward\nthe safer capital structure AI or VR\nacquisitions can't create value but only if\nexecution risk and overpayment are\ncontrolled and the incremental R&D has the\nslowest payoff but the highest strategic\noptionality my model or next I'll show you\na another chart now I'll evolve the\nanalysis to stakeholders the long-term shareholders\nbenefit only if shares are repurchased\nbelow intrinsic value brochure and management\ngain from ownership concentration employees\nbenefit through option value support\nbut dilution can often offset buybacks\nbondholders face higher risk as net cash declines\nand this introduces a agency concern\nbuybacks can improve reported metrics and\nexecuted executive and incentives even when\nthey do not maximize long -term enterprise value\nonto the next stage in the driver framework\nwith reflect the 90 billion dollar\nbillion buyback produces a mechanical under\nearnings per share increase but much of the\nbenefit is value transfer not value creation\nmy recommendation is con a conditional\napproval authorized backpacks with valuation\nand leverage guardrails, prioritize offsetting,\ndilution first, pair repurchases\nwith debt reduction, and preserve\nfunding capacity for R&D and\nstrategic innovation. Capital allocation\nshould be disciplined, transparent, and\naligned with long-term value, not just short\n-term topics, optics, and this completesthe driver framework. Thank you."
