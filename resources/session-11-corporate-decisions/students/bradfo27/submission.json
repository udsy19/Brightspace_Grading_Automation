  "transcript": "Hello Dr. Zhang, my name is Max Bradford and in this video I will evaluate Apple's\n\n hypothetical 90 billion dollar share repurchase using the driver framework.\n\n I'll act as an independent analyst to determine whether the buyback creates\n\n value versus alternative uses of cash while balancing the incentives of\n\n shareholders, management, employees, and bondholders. So for the define and\n\n discover stage, so first we'll define the problem. Apple is considering how to\n\n allocate 90 billion of cash. The options are stock buyback, a six dollar special\n\n dividend, a strategic AI slash VR acquisition, debt reduction, or\n\n incremental R&D. So according to Apple's data, the company had about 14.7\n\n billion shares outstanding as of the 17th of October 2025 and the net income\n\n was about 112 billion. Cash and investments were roughly 165\n\n billion and debt totaled around 112 billion and then interest\n\n expense was around 2.6 billion. So for the purposes of this assignment, we'll\n\n assume a current share price of $185, a PE multiple of 30, and a dividend yield of\n\n 0.5%. So Berkshire owns about 6% of Apple and the CEO holds\n\n 3 million shares and then typical retail investors own 100 shares and\n\n employees have options with $170 strike price. So kind of map that out\n\n here a little bit in my code as you can see here. And then for the represent\n\n stage, so with the problem defined, we represent it as a model. I created a\n\n parameterized Python script that calculates earnings per share, share\n\n price, and stakeholder wealth under each scenario. So key inputs include, as you\n\n can see just here,\n\n a baseline net income, 112 billion, shares outstanding 15.5\n\n billion for simplicity, the 90 billion of available cash, the PE ratio, and an\n\n assumed 2% yield on cash holdings. I also define variables for the acquisition\n\n return, 5% and the R&D return 10%. And compute an average debt interest rate\n\n using total debt and interest expense. So stakeholder holdings, Berkshire 6%, the\n\n CEO's 3 million shares, a retail investors 100 shares, and an employee\n\n stock options are all parameterized so we can assess their value in each case.\n\n So during the implementation stage, I coded separate Python functions here for\n\n each scenario. For the buyback, the script divides the 90\n\n billion by the share price to estimate how many shares are repurchased, reduces\n\n the share count accordingly, subtracts forgone investment\n\n interest income on the cash, and then calculates new\n\n earnings per share and price based on the PE multiple. So for the special\n\n dividend, the total cash outlay is $6 per share times the number of shares. The\n\n script assumes the share price drops by the dividend amount, but that PE ratio\n\n remains constant. The acquisition scenario adds a return from hypothetical\n\n AI slash VR purchase while deducting lost cash interest. So debt reduction\n\n uses the available cash to repay debt, saving interest expense, and subtracts\n\n forgone interest on the cash. And finally, the R&D scenario assumes the entire 90\n\n billion is expensed immediately, lowering current net income, but adds a long-term\n\n return from innovation. The script writes each result to a CSV file and generates a\n\n bar chart comparing EPS across these scenarios, as you can see here. So to\n\n validate my model, I double-checked the calculations manually. For example,\n\n dividing 90 billion by 185 gives us about 486 million shares reproduced, and\n\n subtracting that from 15.5 billion leaves around 15 billion shares\n\n outstanding. So that matches the code's output. Baseline EPS is 112 billion\n\n divided by 15.5 billion shares, or roughly $7.23. In the buyback scenario, net\n\n income falls slightly because of lost interest, but the share count falls more,\n\n so EPS rises to about 7.34. Comparing EPS across all scenarios showed that\n\n buybacks and acquisitions yield the highest EPS across all scenarios, while a\n\n massive R&D spend slashes short-term earnings, as you can see here. So I also\n\n tested different P-E ratios and return assumptions to ensure the conclusions\n\n were robust. So for Evolve, I explored ways to refine the model\n\n further. A more realistic version could incorporate taxes, dynamic P-E multiples\n\n that respond to changes in leverage and cash balances, the dilute effects of\n\n employee stock options and potential credit rating, improvement from debt\n\n reduction, and adjusting the acquisition return from 5% to 3% switches the\n\n ranking of the buyback and acquisition scenarios, demonstrating the\n\n sensitivity of the analysis to assumed returns. And then for the\n\n Reflect stage, so reflecting on the results, the buyback delivers the best\n\n near-term EPS and share price impact because reducing the share count boosts\n\n earnings per share even though overall earnings barely change. However, it\n\n largely transfers value from cash account to shareholders rather than\n\n creating new value. A special dividend distributes cash evenly but doesn't\n\n change ownership percentages, so long-term holders like Berkshire see\n\n less benefit compared with a buyback. A strategic acquisition could\n\n deliver slightly higher EPS if the acquired business earns 5%\n\n return or more, but it involves significant execution risk. Debt\n\n reduction improves Apple's balance sheet and moderately boosts EPS\n\n through interest savings but yields a lower share price increase than the\n\n buyback. So allocating the entire $90 billion to R&D cuts short-term\n\n earnings sharply and only pays it off long-term if\n\n long-term returns exceed expectations. So considering these trade-offs and\n\n stakeholder incentives, I recommend a balanced strategy. Apple could allocate\n\n roughly half the $90 billion to buybacks and capture EPS benefits and\n\n support the share price. Invest a portion strategically sound AR\n\n slash VR acquisitions to drive future growth and use the remainder of the\n\n reduced debt or funded incremental R&D. Such a mix aligns with the management\n\n incentives with long-term shareholder\n\n value while maintaining financial flexibility. So thank you so much for\n\n watching. This concludes my driver-based analysis on the Apple's $90 billion\n capital allocation decision. Thank you."
