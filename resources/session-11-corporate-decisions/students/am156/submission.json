  "transcript": "(0:00) Okay, hello, we'll be going over this assignment overview. (0:06) We validate Apple's hypothetical 90 billion share repurchase using Driver, (0:10) act as an independent analysis who must determine whether the buyback creates value relation to (0:17) alternative users of cash while balancing stakeholder incentives. (0:20) So we will be going over the recommendation over recommending another that explains the (0:25) stakeholders impact agency considerations and value creation versus value transfer outcomes.\n(0:30) So we will be going through these one by one. (0:38) So our stakeholders impact. We know that our larger shareholders benefit from the increased (0:43) ownership percentage.\nWe know that our executives and the equally compensated employees gain from (0:53) EPS and share price support. And the stock options become more valuable. Retail investors (1:06) receive modest indirect benefit through the higher EPS, but there is no immediate cash return.\n(1:14) And other stockholders have little to no direct benefit. And the buyback does not enhance (1:20) operations, innovations, or product quality. So when thinking about the agency considerations, (1:29) the buyback aligns strongly with the management incentives tied to EPS and stock prices.\n(1:36) The risk that capital is allocated to low risk and short term metric improvement. (1:44) There's potential for under investment and higher risk, higher return opportunities. (1:50) So we want to go through the value creation versus value transfer.\nWe know that the shares (1:56) repurchase at high valuation, limit interest in value creation. (2:01) EPS increases due to share count reduction, not higher cash flows. (2:06) So no improvement is competitive advantage or long term growth prospects.\n(2:12) How come it's primarily value transfer from the firm to remain shareholders (2:19) and equity linked insiders. Alternative capital use offer greater potential for true value creation. (2:32) So what do we want to do with this conclusion? The conclusion is that while the 90 billion (2:39) buyback monitor improves EPS and benefits equity linked stakeholders, it largely represents (2:47) a transfer of value rather than the creation of new value.So thank you."
