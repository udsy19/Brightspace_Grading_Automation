  "transcript": "0:02\nHi, I'm Johanna Win from your management\n0:04\n310 class from 4:30 to 5:20 p.m. on\n0:08\nMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. And um\n0:12\nour last week was our our our final week\n0:14\nbefore dead week and uh session 12. So,\n0:17\nthank you for being my teacher. Um in\n0:20\nassignment overview, we have evaluate\n0:23\nApple's hypothetical $90 billion share\n0:27\nrepurchased using Driver. act as an\n0:29\nindependent analyst who must determine\n0:32\nwhether the buyback creates value\n0:34\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\n0:36\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\n0:39\nCapital allocation snapshot includes uh\n0:42\na liquidity of $165 billion in cash and\n0:47\ninvestments $und00 billion uh annual\n0:50\nfree cash flow. uh market context\n0:53\nincludes\n0:54\n185 uh share price with a PE of 30 a\n1:00\ndividend yield of.5%\n1:02\nand uh 15.5 billion shares outstanding\n1:06\num outstanding means you know owed a\n1:08\nbalance sheet of $110 billion debt uh\n1:12\nBeric Shire um owns uh 6% of Apple coe\n1:19\n3 million 3 million shares shares of uh\n1:22\nof Apple. Retail investors um average\n1:26\n100 shares and employees have $170\n1:30\nuh strike options. Um there's a proposal\n1:34\nof $90 billion buyback uh ex uh executed\n1:38\nover one year, 10% of market cap,\n1:42\nalternatives of $6 special dividend,\n1:45\nstrategic AI uh/ uh acquisition, debt\n1:49\nreduction, and incremental R&D. Um, and\n1:53\nit's my job to deliver a recommendation\n1:55\nthat explains stakeholder impacts,\n1:57\nagency considerations, and value uh\n2:00\ncreation versus value traer outcomes.\n2:05\nSo, first you know uh let's ask Gemini\n2:08\nwhat what does buyback mean?\n2:24\nSo a buyback or share repurchase um in\n2:28\nthe context of corporate finance and\n2:29\ncapital allocation like scenario\n2:32\ndiscussed with the $90 billion program\n2:34\nmeans that a company uses its excessive\n2:37\ncash to buy its own shares back like\n2:39\nwhat we talked about in class on Monday\n2:42\num and Wednesday uh from the open market\n2:45\ninstitutional investors or existing\n2:48\nshareholders. And here's, you know, a\n2:51\nvery lengthy explanation. But now that\n2:53\nwe, you know, have that in our minds,\n2:56\num, buying back is also good, you know,\n3:00\nfor like if you predict that your\n3:04\ncompany is going to be earning a lot of\n3:05\nmoney and you want to distribute even\n3:08\nmore shares or you want to you just want\n3:13\nto get a cut of that that good money,\n3:16\nthen you're going to probably want to\n3:18\nbuy back some of your own company. Um,\n3:20\nand that's often a thing that a lot of\n3:22\ncompanies do. Um, you know, obviously\n3:25\nwhen you predict that, you know, you're\n3:27\ngoing to you're going to make it big.\n3:28\nYou you want to you want to get as much\n3:31\nas you can squeeze out of that. So,\n3:35\nuh, I asked, uh, Gemini to help me make\n3:38\nsome code because I don't understand too\n3:41\nmuch of it.\n3:43\nSo, it does do\n3:48\nand it gives me That's That's glitching\n3:50\nout. Uh, Apple Capital um,\n3:57\nhold on.\n4:00\nOops. Where's this response? There we\n4:01\ngo. Okay. Apple uh, capital allocation\n4:04\nmodel initialization of uh, EPS of 6.17,\n4:08\nan initial ROIC of 173.79%.\n4:14\nUm there's a buyback of 6 uh 366, 6.167,\n4:20\n6.457,\n4:22\n6.230,\n4:24\nand 6.167.\n4:26\nUm with interpreting uh earnings per\n4:29\nshare, um you want the bigger number.\n4:32\nThat's because the bigger numbers is the\n4:34\nmore earnings per share you. Yeah. Um\n4:38\nand this is has the ranging impact\n4:40\nbecause this is the most you can tell\n4:43\nthat a bigger percentage bigger impact\n4:46\nfor for what that is. As for leverage,\n4:49\nwhat's leverage in this context? So it's\n4:51\nlike a debt to uh equity ratio. Um the\n4:55\nbigger it is, the more you know kind of\n4:57\nweight it has. So, and if we look\n5:02\num like over here, so it's uh the higher\n5:07\nit is, you know, the more profitable\n5:09\nyou're going to be able to, you know,\n5:12\nlike while we like you've said this many\n5:15\ntimes in class before, so I should know\n5:18\nthat, you know, debt isn't necessarily\n5:20\nbad, having, you know, you know, loans\n5:23\nto help, you know, support uh your\n5:25\nbusiness, to help you make deals,\n5:29\nand uh you know fulfill your contracts\n5:32\nis pretty good and it looks even better\n5:35\nif you're able to pay it all back. Um\n5:40\nso there's that and then we got in oh\n5:43\nokay ROIC\n5:47\nand still Oops. Um, and then we got that\n5:50\nROIC. Um, got a negative 273%.\n5:55\nAnd then we also cut a 1,000%\n5:58\nof, you know, given acquisition probably\n6:00\nbeing the most impactful. Um, so as we\n6:04\nlook over here, the bigger the EPS, the\n6:06\nmore profitability. Like I said, um,\n6:09\nthere was also he also mentioned\n6:11\nownership ch uh changes. I'm pretty sure\n6:13\nApple did not have any changes recently\n6:19\nbecause the only change of the you know\n6:21\nof like the big boss of the company um\n6:26\nI'm pretty sure stepped down or died. So\n6:29\nthere was a change but it was uh a long\n6:32\ntime ago. Um if we go the higher the\n6:35\nROIC the better it is for our investors\n6:37\nand our profitability and also again\n6:40\nstill if we earn more money then we can\n6:43\npay investors better and they like that\n6:46\nand then we can retain them and then\n6:47\nthey'll invest in us and then when we\n6:50\nresell like if hypothetically if we were\n6:52\nto take the $90 billion um deal of of re\n6:56\nregaining our stuff back um we can\n6:59\nprobably cut our so so Apple has let's\n7:02\nsay let's say that we're taking back,\n7:03\nyou know, you know, five shares and we\n7:06\nwant to make it 10 billion shares. We're\n7:10\nturning five into a whole bunch for many\n7:12\ndifferent people to buy up. And yeah, so\n7:16\nthe five already we expect to like earn\n7:20\nus a lot of money and then after we earn\n7:22\nall the money, then we can cut it back\n7:24\nup and redistribute for, you know, happy\n7:27\npeople to be happy with their, you know,\n7:29\nthe money that they get from us.\n7:31\num\n7:32\nthen you know evaluate\n7:37\nyeah let's let's look at the graph\n7:38\nfirst. So, um, earnings impact. So, kind\n7:42\nof like what we said over here, you\n7:43\nwanted a visual. So, dividends and R&D\n7:47\ndidn't really change too much. And\n7:49\nthey're also the same earnings per\n7:51\nshare, which arguably, you know, isn't,\n7:53\nyou know, I guess it isn't zero, but\n7:56\nit's not as\n7:58\ndifferent as other stuff, but we do get\n8:02\na lot from acquisition, do get a little\n8:04\nfrom debt reduction, and it's pretty\n8:08\npretty good pretty good buyback. Um, and\n8:11\nwe also have change in retail ownership.\n8:14\nI guess there's a little here, but\n8:16\nbecause I mean the ownership being that\n8:19\nwe're getting it back with the 90\n8:21\nbillion. So there's that. Um and so\n8:26\nyeah, so we're going to go back to here.\n8:31\nUm so evaluating uh the program creating\n8:35\nvalue uh merely transfer its value among\n8:38\nstakeholders highlighting agency and\n8:40\ngovernment's implications. So the $90\n8:43\nbillion program is likely a blend of\n8:46\nvalue transfer and value uh creation.\n8:49\nThe agency and governance challenge for\n8:51\nApple is to prove that buyback is driven\n8:53\nby genuine capital efficiency, value\n8:55\ncreation um and not a desire to simply\n8:58\nboost you know you know EPS. And\n9:01\narguably I mean personally a\n9:03\nrecommendation I would have for this\n9:04\nassignment is that Apple buy back it\n9:07\nshares. $90 billion is a is a lot of\n9:10\nmoney. And like you said recently uh\n9:14\nwith like on on Friday that maybe we\n9:17\nmight eventually have a a trillionaire\n9:20\nsoon and you know those billions of\n9:22\ndollars will help you know invest in all\n9:25\nof our stuff or a project that will help\n9:28\nus be more uh efficient. Um and uh so\n9:32\ndiscuss signaling effects. So, you know,\n9:36\nif we share buy share buyback, um our\n9:39\nour stock is undervalued, which is under\n9:42\nlike pretty good. So, then you can buy\n9:44\nit back and then woohoo, you get a lot\n9:46\nmore money because it's undervalued. Um\n9:49\nit's it's less than what it's actually\n9:50\nworth. So, then we get more money.\n9:52\nWoohoo. Uh dividend increase. Um our\n9:54\nprofitability is uh stable and\n9:57\nsustainable, which is pretty good. Um\n10:00\nsee commitment brown here poted for uh\n10:02\nincome and conservative events\n10:04\ninvestors. Uh sustainability is also\n10:06\ngood for you know a lot of old people\n10:08\nwant to invest in you know something\n10:09\nthat's going to last for a long time. Uh\n10:11\nso do you um decrease uh dividend\n10:16\nincrease? Uh we already talked about\n10:17\nthat acquisition you know that's what\n10:20\nwe're doing. Uh the buybacks we're\n10:22\npurchasing you know pursuing external\n10:24\ngrowth and market dominance. That\n10:26\nreduction is we are de-risking in uh the\n10:28\nbalance sheet and R&D investment. We are\n10:30\ninvesting in long-term organic growth.\n10:34\nSo hopefully that answers all of these\n10:38questions. Thank you so much."
