You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the task, stakeholders, objectives, and alternatives up front (Discover). Modeling and visualization steps are introduced afterward (graph and model initialization), so the D-stage was documented and completed before modeling, satisfying the strict criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student qualitatively recognized that reducing debt lowers risk (“de-risking”), meeting the financial risk aspect. However, they did not identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield), and their leverage discussion was simplistic. Therefore, the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student briefly mentions agency/governance but does not identify who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders under each option, nor why incentives diverge. They also do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks, and their leverage discussion is superficial. Given these substantive omissions, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies leverage as debt-to-equity and notes that higher leverage can increase profitability, showing basic understanding of return amplification. However, they do not explicitly explain that leverage amplifies losses nor that debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. Given the MODERATE standard, this is a correct but basic treatment, warranting PARTIAL.",
