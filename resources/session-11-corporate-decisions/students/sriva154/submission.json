  "transcript": "0:00\nHi everyone, my name is Sharanya and today I\n0:03\nwill be evaluating Apple's hypothetical\n0:04\n$90 billion share repurchase program\n0:07\nusing the drivers framework. Um I'll\n0:09\nwalk through each of the drivers stage\n0:11\ndirectly inside my Python model. So\n0:14\nyou'll get to see how the analysis\n0:15\nunfolds from assumptions to modeling to\n0:18\nmy final recommendation for Apple. Now\n0:22\num let's begin with define. My core\n0:25\nquestion is does a $90 billion buyback\n0:29\ncreate value compared to a dividend debt\n0:33\nreduction strategic acquisition or\n0:35\nincremental R&D and more importantly\n0:38\nwhich stakeholders win or lose under\n0:40\neach scenario and does the buyback\n0:42\ncreate value or merely transfer it.\n0:46\nuh to structure the program um the\n0:48\nproblem\n0:49\nI um\n0:53\ndefined Apple's baseline financials\n0:56\ndirectly in Python as it's written over\n0:59\nhere.\n1:01\nUm, so there is $165 billion liquidity,\n1:05\n$100 billion\n1:07\nfree cash flow, $185 share price, which\n1:12\nis like 30 times the PE, uh, a 15.5\n1:17\nshares out billion shares outstanding\n1:20\nand $110 billion\n1:23\nin total debt. And then I input the\n1:26\nstakeholders details. So, Birkshshire\n1:29\nowns 6%, the CEO owns 3 million in\n1:32\nshares. Our retail example shows 100\n1:35\nshares and employees have 200 million\n1:38\noptions with $870 strike.\n1:43\nSo, defining these inputs ensures that\n1:46\nthe model reflects Apple's real\n1:47\nincentive landscape and not just\n1:49\nmechanics like EPS.\n1:53\nNow um\n1:56\nmoving down to discover\n1:59\nwe are going to identify what we need to\n2:01\nmodel and how the financial mechanics\n2:03\nshould work.\n2:06\nSo through discovery, I realized that I\n2:08\nneeded to measure five things across\n2:10\nevery capital allocation choice, which\n2:13\nis EPS impact, share price impact,\n2:15\nassuming that the market keeps Apple's\n2:17\nPE stable. Uh leverage effects,\n2:20\nstakeholder wealth shifts, and value\n2:23\ncreation versus value transfer. So, and\n2:26\nthen this required me to build a model\n2:28\nthat can reduce share count for\n2:30\nbuybacks, drop share price for\n2:32\ndividends, adjust net income for\n2:34\ninterest saved or foregone, um model\n2:37\nROIC versus WACCC for acquisitions, and\n2:41\ncapital capture long-term EPS uplift for\n2:44\nR&D.\n2:46\nUm, so I designed this I designed a\n2:49\ngeneral scenario result object to store\n2:52\nall those outputs making it easy to\n2:54\ncompare scenarios side by side later.\n2:57\nNow um,\n2:59\nmoving on to represent\n3:02\nI map out the modeling logic by writing\n3:05\nfunctions for each capital allocation\n3:07\nchoice. So for example, the buyback uh\n3:12\nfunction removes shares, adjusts net\n3:14\nincome for lost interest and\n3:16\nrecalculates EPS and price.\n3:20\nUh the special dividend function drops\n3:23\nshare price by dividend amount. The debt\n3:26\nreduction function increases net income\n3:28\nthrough interest savings. The\n3:30\nacquisition function models long-term\n3:34\nsorry uh the acquisition functions\n3:36\nmodels incremental net income from ROIC\n3:41\nexceeding WACC.\n3:44\nUm and the R&D scenario boosts long-term\n3:47\nEPS by raising growth over five years\n3:53\nas we have over here.\n3:57\nUm okay moving on to implement.\n4:05\nThere we go.\n4:08\nWe um run all the scenarios and generate\n4:11\na single comparison table. So we can see\n4:13\nthe outputs. Now\n4:16\nthese are the outputs.\n4:21\nUh so in the EPS comparison our buyback\n4:25\nis 6.13.\n4:28\nUm our debt reduction is 6.40.\n4:33\nUm our AI VR acquisition is 6.86\n4:38\nand our R&D is 6.78.\n4:42\nIn our leverage comparison,\n4:44\nleverage comparison sorry our buyback\n4:48\ndividend is\n4:50\naround negative 3 point it's around\n4:54\nsorry uh 3.8%.\n4:57\nOur debt reduction is around.7%.\n5:01\nUm and our AIVR plus our R&D is around\n5:06\n3.3%.\n5:10\nUm\n5:12\nsorry our so then moving on to our\n5:15\nretail investor wealth\n5:20\num we can see that our buyback for that\n5:22\nis 18.4K our special dividend is 18.5k\n5:27\num our debt reduction is 19.2k\n5:30\nand our AIVR is 20.6K and our R&D gives\n5:35\nus 20.3K.\n5:37\nSo this gives us a clear datadriven view\n5:40\nof outcomes across the stakeholders that\n5:42\nwe have.\n5:44\nNow moving on to validate. So we're\n5:46\nthese are the three\n5:49\ngraphs um sorry the charts that were\n5:52\nmade\n5:55\num for the EPS charts. So basically what\n5:58\nwe're going to use with these charts is\n6:00\nwe pressure test the results to see if\n6:02\nthey make any economic sense or not. So\n6:04\nin the EPS chart, the buyback slightly\n6:07\nreduces EPS relative to the debt\n6:10\nreduction\n6:12\num R&D or an acquisition. So this\n6:14\nhappens because Apple sacrifices\n6:16\ninterest income when using cash. Our\n6:19\ndebt reduction and investment actually\n6:21\nadd net income. So their EPS advantage\n6:24\nmakes sense.\n6:26\nNext, moving on to our leverage chart.\n6:29\nour debt reduction dramatically lowers\n6:31\nour le leverage as we can see here. So\n6:34\nfrom 3.7 to 7%.\n6:38\nThis is consistent with paying down 90\n6:40\nbillion of debt.\n6:43\nUm and then lastly moving on to the\n6:45\nretail wealth chart.\n6:48\nThe highest retail wealth comes from the\n6:50\nAIVR acquisition\n6:53\nand R&D because these scenarios grow in\n6:55\nintrinsic firm value instead of simply\n6:58\nreshuffling reshuffleling capital since\n7:01\nthe results align with expected finance\n7:03\ntheory and Apple's economics. The model\n7:06\npasses validation.\n7:09\nNow moving on to evolve.\n7:13\nIn evolve I explore how the sensitive\n7:15\nrecommendation is to changes. For\n7:17\nexample, if I increase the assumed ROIC\n7:20\non the acquisition, the strategic option\n7:22\nbecomes even more attractive. If I\n7:24\nassume the lower sustained growth from\n7:26\nR&D, its advantage narrows. If the\n7:29\nbuybacks were funded by debt instead of\n7:31\nthe cash, EPS might increase, but um\n7:36\nleverage would jump raising the risk.\n7:39\nNow, these evolutions\n7:41\nshow that the buybacks only create value\n7:43\nif they're done when shares are\n7:45\nundervalued or financed in a\n7:47\nstrategically optimal way. Neither of\n7:49\nwhich is guaranteed here.\n7:53\nNow, moving on to reflect. Finally, in\n7:56\nreflect, I tie together the financial\n7:58\nreasoning with stakeholder incentives\n8:00\nand agency issues. Our key observation\n8:03\nshows that the buyback does not create\n8:05\nvalue. It mostly transfers value to\n8:07\nremaining shareholders while reducing\n8:09\ncash flexibility.\n8:11\nUm, our stakeholder takeaways show that\n8:15\nretail investors benefit far more from\n8:17\ngrowth investments than from buybacks.\n8:20\nBurkshshire and the CEO, large equity\n8:22\nholders prefer buybacks which\n8:24\nconcentrate the ownership. Employees\n8:26\ngain the most under the acquisition\n8:28\nscenarios because higher share prices\n8:30\nlift option values and bond holders\n8:34\nprefer debt reduction over anything.\n8:38\nAnd then lastly for value creation\n8:40\nranking from strongest to the weakest.\n8:43\nOur strongest is the strategic AI VR\n8:46\nacquisition which has the highest EPS\n8:49\nplus the highest value creation proxy.\n8:52\nSecond is the incremental R&D which\n8:54\ngives us long-term compounding. Third is\n8:57\nthe debt reduction which is lower risk\n8:59\nand moderate EPS improvement. Fourth is\n9:02\nthe special dividend which is the\n9:04\nneutral wealth transfer. And then lastly\n9:06\nwe have buyback uh which is the lowest\n9:09\nEPS and the highest opportunity cost.\n9:12\nAnd then so my fi for my final\n9:14\nrecommendation based on all the model\n9:17\noutputs Apple should prioritize the high\n9:19\nROIC strategic investments or\n9:22\nincremental R&D. These provide the\n9:24\nstrongest long-term value creation for\n9:27\nsharehold shareholders\n9:29\nwhile supporting innovation and future\n9:31\ncash flow growth. The $90 billion\n9:34\nbuyback in contrast appears to be a\n9:37\nvalue transfer rather than a value\n9:39\ncreation event.\n9:41\nThank you for listening and this\n9:42\nconcludes my driver-based allocation\n9:44analysis for Apple."
