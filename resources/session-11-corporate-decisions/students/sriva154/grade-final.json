  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital structure factors (cash/liquidity, leverage, interest impacts, flexibility) and supports a clear directional stance (avoid buyback; prioritize investments/R&D; debt reduction lowers risk) with quantitative scenario analysis and sensitivity. The coverage is detailed across multiple DRIVER stages, satisfying a thorough introductory-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly distinguishes genuine value creation (ROIC>WACC acquisitions, long-term R&D compounding) from redistribution (dividends, buybacks), explicitly addressing opportunity cost and long-term impact. Multiple scenarios, quantitative outputs, and sensitivity analysis across DRIVER stages support a comprehensive, accurate assessment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly links capital allocation choices to management and stakeholder incentives (CEO equity, employee options, stock-price effects) and highlights conflicts between retail shareholders and management/large holders. They address governance/agency directly in the Reflect stage and support it with scenario outputs, meeting the depth needed for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly recognizes that increasing debt raises financial risk and discusses leverage across DRIVER stages. However, they do not identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the missing tax-shield side of the trade-off, coverage is correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies who gains/loses under different options and notes incentive divergence (shareholders/large holders vs bondholders/employees) and leverage-driven risk. However, they do not explicitly explain asset substitution/risk-shifting mechanics (how higher leverage/buybacks can transfer value from bondholders via risk-taking) or management-specific agency incentives. Coverage is accurate but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains that using debt can increase EPS while raising risk and shows that paying down debt lowers leverage, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief, lacks detailed examples or calculations, and does not explicitly connect debt to fixed interest obligations and default risk. This meets a basic standard but falls short of the thorough depth required for a PASS.",
