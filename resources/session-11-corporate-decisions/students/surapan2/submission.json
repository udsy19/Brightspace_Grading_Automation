  "transcript": "0:00\nToday we are going to do our session 11\n0:03\nassignment which is a corporate\n0:05\nfinancial decision analysis. So as\n0:07\nalways I'm going to first go over the\n0:10\nassignment. Here we have to evaluate\n0:13\nApple's hypothetical $90 billion share\n0:15\npurchase using the driver framework and\n0:18\nact as an independent anal analyst who\n0:20\nwants to deter determine whether the\n0:22\nbuyback creates value relative to\n0:24\nalternate uses cash while balancing\n0:27\nstakeholder incentives.\n0:29\nSo here I'm not going to read all this\n0:30\nout but we have the capital allocation\n0:33\nsnapshot with different numerical values\n0:36\nand our job today is to deliver a\n0:38\nrecommendation that explains stakeholder\n0:40\nimpacts agency considerations and value\n0:43\ncreation versus value transfer outcomes.\n0:46\nSo now going into the assignment, I'm\n0:49\ngoing to start with my final answer as\n0:51\nalways and then dive into the how I use\n0:53\na driver framework and then explain the\n0:55\nmath concepts, the code and outputs. So\n0:59\ngoing into the final answer, I recommend\n1:01\nas an analyst to execute the $90 billion\n1:05\nshare repurchase program and after\n1:08\nevaluating the alternatives against\n1:09\nApple's capital structure and\n1:11\nstakeholder incentives, the $90 billion\n1:14\nbuyback is optimal capital allocation\n1:16\ndecision, but it should be paired with\n1:19\nan a sustained R&D budget. and why. I'll\n1:23\nobviously go into the math behind this\n1:25\nin a second, but I'll first wanted to\n1:27\nexplain it here in the beginning of the\n1:29\nvideo. The EPS accreation is one of the\n1:32\nreasons because the buyback provides the\n1:34\nmost immediate and certain boost to the\n1:36\nearnings per share increasing it from\n1:38\n617 to 652 which is approximately a 6%\n1:42\nincrease large which is due to the\n1:44\nreduction share cow. Next, the capital\n1:47\nefficiency with the 165 billion in\n1:50\nliquid liquidity and 100 billion annual\n1:53\nFCF. Apple's over equitized hoarding\n1:56\ncash dampens return investing capital\n1:59\nRIC and returning cash optimizes the\n2:02\nbalance sheet without threatening\n2:03\nsolveny as the net cash is positive.\n2:07\nNext, for the lack of viable M&A M&A\n2:10\nalternatives, the $90 acquisition\n2:13\ncarries massive execution risk and\n2:15\nregulatory scrutiny and there are few\n2:18\ntargets at the size that offer better\n2:20\nreturn than Apple's phone stock at the\n2:23\nP& of 30 P divided by E of 30. Um, next\n2:27\nthe tax deficiency unlike the $6 special\n2:29\ndividend which triggers immediate\n2:31\ntaxable events for retail investors in\n2:34\nBirkshshire or Hathaway a buyback defers\n2:36\ntaxes allowing shareholders to compound\n2:38\ngains.\n2:40\nThe one caveat is with this which is\n2:42\nimportant financial math concept is that\n2:45\nthis is a value transfer mechanism from\n2:47\nselling the shareholders to remain runs\n2:49\nnot an organic value creation which is\n2:53\nit signals maturity to mitigate the\n2:55\nperception of writing out of ideas.\n2:57\nApple must explicitly communicate that\n2:59\nthis buyback does not come at the\n3:00\nexpense of its R&D budget.\n3:03\nNow diving into the driver framework and\n3:05\nhow we went about approaching this\n3:07\nproblem. Of course, before diving into\n3:10\nthe pro code, I had to define the\n3:12\nproblem, gathered the context, which I\n3:14\ndid define the context in the beginning\n3:15\nof this video, so I won't really go over\n3:17\nit again, but I defined the problem, the\n3:19\nconstraints we had, and then also the\n3:22\ndata gathered of the values, the\n3:24\nimportant values from the problem\n3:25\ncontext. Next, the R and driver\n3:28\nframework. I had to represent.\n3:30\nSo, I mapped out the logic flow for the\n3:32\nanalysis. I first laid out the mechanics\n3:35\nwhich I determined that the buyback\n3:36\nreduces the shares outstanding\n3:38\ndenominator but also reduces the cash\n3:40\nasset and interest income which impacted\n3:44\nthe P&L impact which was an important\n3:47\nthing to understand before going into\n3:49\nthe code.\n3:54\nNext, for the comparison, I need to\n3:56\ncompare the buyback against the status\n3:59\nquo of doing nothing, the dividend of\n4:02\npaying the $90 billion directly to\n4:03\nholders, the debt payown, reducing the\n4:06\n110 billion debt load, and the\n4:09\nacquisition of spending the 900 billion\n4:11\nto buy\n4:13\nthe even\n4:15\nthe EBITDA.\n4:17\nThe model design was of course a Python\n4:19\nscript using a scenario class to\n4:22\ncalculate the EPS leverage and cash\n4:23\noutcomes for each option because of\n4:25\ncourse we want to compare. Next for the\n4:28\nimplement I built the P Python code\n4:31\nusing\n4:32\nGoogle Collab and these are my inputs\n4:35\nand\n4:36\nI automated the calculation of the new\n4:38\nshare count using the new shares equals\n4:40\nold shares minus parentheses by back\n4:43\namount divided by share price. So, let\n4:45\nme go to the Python code now. Run it.\n4:54\nOkay, here we go. Here's my code. Let me\n4:57\nquickly go through it. Here we have the\n5:00\ndriver stage of the defined discover,\n5:02\nwhich meant we just had all of our\n5:04\ninputs coded into this.\n5:08\nThen we wanted to implement and\n5:10\nrepresent our logic. So we have scenario\n5:13\nanalysis and we have the different\n5:14\nscenarios of the status code do nothing\n5:17\nand the values for that with the\n5:19\nformulas here and then this for each\n5:22\nscenario we have different formulas we\n5:25\nneeded for example if the shares retired\n5:27\nis the buyback amount divided by the\n5:28\nApple share price the new shares is the\n5:30\nApple shares starting by minus the\n5:32\nshares retired and so on and so on I'll\n5:35\nexplain more of the math in a second but\n5:37\nhere for each one there's the scenarios\n5:39\nappend with the values for the scenario.\n5:42\nAnd then going on you have the rest of\n5:44\nthe scenarios and then we have the\n5:46\nintegration visualization stage right\n5:49\nhere which will you'll see a plot of the\n5:52\ndata\n5:54\nbut that's right here and it helped give\n5:57\na visual representation so that people\n5:59\nwith limited understanding could still\n6:00\nvisualize and see this and then we have\n6:03\nthe execution of all the printing\n6:05\nlabels. So here we go. Now, I'm going to\n6:08\nzoom back in and then\n6:12\nhere we go. So,\n6:15\nhere we go. We have the different\n6:17\nscenarios. We have five different\n6:18\nscenarios\n6:20\nand we have the earnings per share right\n6:22\nhere. And as you can see, the status\n6:25\ncode\n6:26\nhas the smallest earnings per share and\n6:29\nthe debt payown has the\n6:32\none of the largest with the acquisition\n6:34\nactually having\n6:36\noh sorry my bad. The dividend has the\n6:40\nsmallest earnings per share and the\n6:42\nacquisition has the largest earnings per\n6:44\nshare and the shares are all 15.5\n6:49\nbillion but the buyback would result in\n6:51\nmore shares and then also for the new\n6:54\ndebt the status Q and the debt payown\n6:58\nboth has negative debt of 55 billion\n7:00\nwhile the buyback dividend and\n7:03\nacquisition have positive debt of 35\n7:05\nbillion.\n7:07\nAnd here we have our validation\n7:09\nframework. The validation pass the\n7:10\nbuyback is accredited to the EPS. But\n7:13\nthen now here we have visualization.\n7:15\nIt's zoomed in to show the minor\n7:17\ndifferences. Again as you can see the\n7:19\ndividend earnings per share is the least\n7:21\nby a good margin. And then the\n7:23\nacquisition is slightly bigger but it is\n7:26\nthe largest. One debt payown falls\n7:28\nclosely behind and so on and so on. I'll\n7:31\nexplain the math behind a lot of this in\n7:33\na second now. But going through the data\n7:36\nframework, the validating, checking the\n7:38\noutputs, the I have three checks coded\n7:41\ninto my code. Did EPS go up in the\n7:43\nbuyback scenario? Yes, it did because\n7:45\nthe share count dropped by 486 million\n7:47\nshares. Check two. Is the company\n7:50\nsolvent? Yes, the cash is 165 billion\n7:53\nminus the buyback of 90 billion le 75\n7:55\nbillion. The debt is 110 billion. Net\n7:58\ndepth is manageable given $100 billion\n8:00\nannual FCF. So it's valid. Check three.\n8:03\nThe comparison the dividend scenario\n8:05\nleaves share count unchanged resulting\n8:07\nin lower EPS than the buyback due to\n8:09\nloss interest income on cash paid out.\n8:13\nNext in the framework which you saw the\n8:16\nscenario sensitivity. What if the price\n8:18\nrises by 210? The $9 billion shares the\n8:21\n90 billion buys fewer shares reducing\n8:24\nthe EPS boost. the buyback becomes less\n8:26\neffective as the stock becomes\n8:28\nexpensive.\n8:30\nNext, what if the interest rates drop?\n8:32\nThe opportunity cost of spending the\n8:33\ncash decreases making even more\n8:35\nattractive mathematically. And those are\n8:37\ndifferent scenarios to understand\n8:39\nbecause that's very realistic in the\n8:40\nreal world.\n8:43\nBefore I get into my reflecting, I'm\n8:45\ngoing to explain the financial analysis\n8:47\nmore because this is what the project is\n8:50\nall about. Learning different financial\n8:51\nconcepts.\n8:56\nSo first one of the big things we need\n8:58\nto understand was stakeholder outcomes.\n9:02\nOne the retail shareholders they\n9:04\ngenuinely prefer buybacks. They get\n9:06\nprice support buying pressure and tax\n9:08\ndeferral. They're forced to take a tax\n9:10\nit like they would without with a\n9:11\ndividend. For the institutional holders,\n9:15\nthey strongly also prefer buybacks\n9:19\nbecause\n9:20\nnormally historically buybacks preferred\n9:23\nbecause the percent ownership increases\n9:25\nwithout spending their own money and a\n9:28\ndividend would hit a company like\n9:30\nBirkshshire with a massive tax bill.\n9:32\nNext, another stakeholder management.\n9:35\nThey also prefer buybacks because a\n9:37\nmetric hitting buyback boosts EPS\n9:39\ndropped in a key metric for executive\n9:41\nbonuses. Also, value transfer. The CEO\n9:44\nholds $3 million in shares and a buyback\n9:46\nsupports the share price directly\n9:48\nincreasing his wealth. So, obviously,\n9:49\nthey're going to prefer it. Similarly,\n9:52\nthe employees also prefer buybacks\n9:54\nbecause the strike price and impact and\n9:57\ndividends drop the stock price\n9:58\nmechanically and the X dividend date\n10:00\nhurting option value. buybacks reduce\n10:02\nshare count and support the strap risk\n10:03\nkeeping their options in the money.\n10:06\nBut bond holders differently prefer debt\n10:09\nreduction or status qubacks\n10:12\nreduce the cash cushion of be able to\n10:14\npay back debt. So however given Apple's\n10:17\n$100 billion FCF bond holders are\n10:19\nunlikely to protest a specific buyback\n10:21\nbecause they are welloff company. Nex\n10:25\none of the most important financial\n10:27\nmanagement concepts.\n10:30\nOops. Why don't I just\n10:35\nis value creation versus value transfer.\n10:38\nValue creation is the organic RMD and\n10:41\ngood acquisitions create value by\n10:43\ngenerating new cash flows that don't\n10:45\ndidn't exist before. And that's a big\n10:47\nthing. Generating new cash flows for\n10:50\nvalue creation. Next, value transfer is\n10:53\nkind of more like financial engineering.\n10:55\nThe $9 billion buyback is primarily\n10:58\nvalue transfer, which I explained in the\n10:59\nbeginning of the video. It does not\n11:01\ncreate a new product, but it transfers\n11:03\nvalue from the shareholders who sell who\n11:05\nget the cash to the shareholders who\n11:06\nstay who get a larger slice of the pie.\n11:09\nNo. If Apple buys back stock below the\n11:12\nintrinsic value, transfers wealth to the\n11:14\nremaining shareholders. Then they buy\n11:16\nbuy back above intrinsic value, they\n11:18\ndestroy shareholder wealth. And at the\n11:22\nPOV of 30, this is a risk.\n11:25\nNext, the sign signaling agency effects.\n11:31\nFor signaling, the buyback signals we\n11:33\nbelieve our stock is undervalued or we\n11:35\nhave a mature cash cow with no massive\n11:38\ngrowth projects requiring 90 billion.\n11:40\nWhile the dividend signals we are\n11:42\nutility like company now expect steady\n11:44\nslow growth in the RD acquisition\n11:46\nsignals we are still in aggressive\n11:48\ngrowth mode and agency costs. There's a\n11:52\nrisk that managers using the buyback to\n11:53\ninflict the stock price in the short\n11:55\nterm to maximize the value of their\n11:56\noptions vesting potentially the expense\n11:59\nof their long-term R&D investment. And\n12:01\nthis is really important to understand\n12:03\nwhen deciding my final decision. And\n12:06\nit's important to also think about even\n12:08\nlike besides what the reality is like\n12:10\nseeing how it signals the different\n12:12\nshareholders because everyone has a role\n12:14\nin this decision.\n12:16\nNow going a little bit further into the\n12:18\nactual core math I as I the current net\n12:22\nnet income was calculated using the net\n12:24\nincome equals the share price times\n12:26\nshares outstanding divided the PE ratio\n12:29\nthe impact of spending cash/ opportunity\n12:31\ncost when Apple spent 90 billion on 5x\n12:34\ndividends or debt it lose interest\n12:36\nincome that cash was earning in the bank\n12:38\nand then that loss interest income was\n12:40\ncalculated cash spent times the interest\n12:43\nrate which was assumed to be 4% times\n12:45\nthe one minus the tax rate. And for the\n12:48\nbuyback mechanics, the shares\n12:50\nrepurchased are calculated by the\n12:51\nbuyback amount divided by share price.\n12:54\nThe new share count, old shares minus\n12:55\nshares repurchased. And the new EPS old\n12:58\nnet income minus cost income divide a\n13:00\nnew share account. That's that was what\n13:02\nthey put into the code for each scenario\n13:04\nlike I was showing you. And the\n13:06\nleverage, the net debt is equals total\n13:08\ndebt minus cash remaining. And positive\n13:10\nnet debt means debt is greater than\n13:13\ncash. Negative net debt means cash is\n13:15\ngreater than debt.\n13:18\nFinally, going a little bit further into\n13:20\nmy output, the current net income\n13:22\nderivation, because this is I provided\n13:25\nmarket data, specifically the price and\n13:26\nthe P& rather than the accounting data,\n13:28\nthe net income, I derived the starting\n13:31\nnet income using the net income formula\n13:32\nlike I showed you up here.\n13:35\nThat was something I had to make the\n13:36\ndecision to do. And the calculation of\n13:39\nthe market cap was\n13:41\n185\n13:44\ntimes the 15.5 billion shares which\n13:46\nequaled the 2.867.5\n13:49\nbillion and the net income was that\n13:52\n2867.5 billion divided by the 30 P&\n13:55\nwhich gave us the 95.58 billion and that\n13:59\nresulted the output of this formula as a\n14:01\nbaseline net income of the 95.6 billion.\n14:03\nthe serves as starting point for the\n14:05\nstatus Q scenario and results in the\n14:07\n6.17 EPS see the analysis which show you\n14:12\nthat quickly again\n14:15\nthis is what it is talking about right\n14:18\nhere and then you can see these are the\n14:21\ninputs loaded\n14:23\nfinally the graph inflation\n14:26\nthe math the dividend scenario resulted\n14:29\nin the EPS of 5.98\n14:31\nbecause the value is now below the\n14:33\ncharts bottom cut up six. That's why\n14:35\nit's not visible in the map because I\n14:36\nwanted to zoom in and see the small\n14:38\ndiscrepancies in the other one to really\n14:40\ndecide what the best decision was.\n14:46\nBut financial wise, this effectively is\n14:48\nillustrated the dividend is the worst\n14:49\noption for EPS while other options kept\n14:51\nEPS above the 615 which was the main\n14:54\ngoal or main barrier. the dividend track\n14:58\ndown the company sweep the cash loss and\n15:00\ninterest income but didn't reduce the\n15:02\nshare account to compensate that loss\n15:05\nfinally going back and bringing it back\n15:07\nto the driver framework I wanted to\n15:09\nquickly reflect on this assignment what\n15:11\nI mainly learned is the math of\n15:13\nbuyback's simple but that governance is\n15:15\ncomplex dealing with the stakeholders\n15:17\nand the signaling and my observation was\n15:20\nwhile the buyback optimizes financial\n15:22\nmetrics like the EPS and the roe it\n15:25\nartificially inflates the value of stock\n15:27\nbased compensation options creating a\n15:30\npotential agency conflict for M\n15:31\nmanagement again while the government\n15:33\nspecifically is complex but ultimately\n15:37\nmy recommendation again is to execute\n15:39\nthe $90 billion share repurchase program\n15:41\nbut it should be sustained with the\n15:43\nsustained R&D budget thank you so much\n15:46for listening"
