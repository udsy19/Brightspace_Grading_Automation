  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student covers shareholders and bondholders in depth and explicitly discusses management via signaling/optimization, and briefly notes employees in the dividend section. Given the thorough, multi-angle discussion and cross-stakeholder synthesis, stakeholder coverage meets a comprehensive, introductory-level standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem definition at the start and documents the data source used (Yahoo Finance). The student also verbally outlines the sequence—define, research, identify options, verify, evaluate—showing D-stage occurred before modeling/analysis, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies that higher leverage/debt increases financial risk (liquidity, credit rating, smaller equity cushion), meeting one side of the trade-off. However, they never mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate standard, this is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies winners/losers for several options (e.g., buybacks and dividends hurting bondholders via reduced cushion/liquidity, debt reduction helping bondholders but less attractive to shareholders) and ties this to leverage/liquidity. However, coverage of agency conflicts beyond shareholders vs bondholders is limited (minimal on management, brief on employees, none on large holders), and asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics are not explicitly explained. Under a moderate standard, this shows basic but incomplete understanding, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly notes higher leverage, reduced equity cushion, liquidity strain, and potential credit rating/bankruptcy implications (risk), and that buybacks can raise share value (return). However, they do not explain leverage’s amplification of EPS/ROE nor address interest as a fixed obligation that raises default risk. Coverage is correct but basic, so PARTIAL.",
