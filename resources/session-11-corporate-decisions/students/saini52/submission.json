  "transcript": "All right. So, this is a session uh 11 assignment. Our goal here today is to analyze Apple's 90 billion share repurchase proposal and alternative capital allocation strategies using the driver framework to calculate relevant uh financial metrics, evaluate the impacts of the various stakeholders, the shareholder, CEO, employees, stuff like that. Consider agency issues, distinguish between value creation and transfer and provide a compre comprehensive recommendation. So um first we need to kind of\n\nunderstand and you know just get the driver framework which we have right here. I'm just going to scroll past that for now since it's pretty common but I'm going to explain what each part of the driver thing is at the end. So uh first we have to calculate the financial metrics. So to calculate the relevant financial metrics based on that based on the provided capital allocation snapshot including current mac uh market capitalization number of shares to be repurchased potential impact on shares\n\noutstanding and other relevant ratios for the company. First Gemini uh defined the necessary input value or variables and for Apple's financial data including the share price, share outstanding net income and share repurchase proposal value as no specific data frame or snapshot was provided. Um, so right here you can see we have 170 USD per share and we have a very very large these are very large numbers but 15.15 or 15.5 billion shares 97 billion shares uh or n sorry 97 billion net income and 90\n\nbillion repurchase proposal. So these just right here uh print out what these values mean up here. It also kind of gave us a little reasoning here that the input variables are defined. So now it's going to kind of proceed with calculating the requested financial metrics. So what we're basically asked to find. So the first one right here would be to calculate the current market capitalization which would be current share price times current shares outstanding. We'd also have to calculate\n\nshares to be repurchased which would be total repurchase proposal divided by current share price. And then we have shares outstanding after repurchase which would be current shares outstanding minus shares to be repurchased. Uh we also have current EPS which would be the latest annual net income divided by current shares outstanding. And then to calculate the earning per share after repurchase we have to put an in if else statement. So if sharing outstanding after purchase is greater than zero then\n\nit's going to be projected EPS after repurchase equaling latest annual net income/sharing outstanding after repurchase. Otherwise, it's going to be um just a float right here or handle as appropriate, whatever um number. So, these print statements give us the information down here. So, our current market capitalization is 2.6 almost. It's a very large number. Number of shares to be repurchased is 529 um million. Shares outstanding after repurchase, we're looking around 14 billion right there. And the current\n\nearnings per share is 6.26. 26 and projected earnings per share is going to be 6.48. So then we have to analyze the repurchase proposal. So to evaluate the direct financial impact of the 90 billion share repurchase consider its effects on earning per share EPS so on so forth. So we have some more statements here if statements. If the EPS is not equal to zero, uh the percentage increase EPS would be projected EPS after repurchase minus current EPS divided by current EPS times 100. Otherwise, it would be just zero.\n\nAnd then to calculate our percentage reduction, if current shares outstandings does not equal zero, it would be percentage reduction shares uh equaling shares to be repurchased divided by current shares outstanding times 100. Otherwise it would be percentage reduction shares equals zero. And so right here we have 3.54 for percentage increase and 3.42 for the shares in outstanding. Then we have the direct financial impact of the share repurchase. So there's 90 billion shares to repurchase proposed by\n\nApple that has several direct financial impacts. One of them would be the EPS or earning per share. Um and the second would be impact on the ownership structure. So the market perception of this would be signaling financial health and confidence. A large uh share repurchase often signals the company has strong cash flow and robust balance sheet. Uh the mark management's view on the stock under valvaluation. So companies often initiate uh share buybacks when the management believes the company's stock\n\nis undervalued by the market. Enhancing the investor confidence. So the increase in the EPS and the reduction in the shares outstanding can make the stock look more attractive to investors. Therefore, they might invest. Um four would be capital allocation discipline. So a buyback or buyback can indicate that the company has evaluated other company or other capital allocation options like reinvestment in businesses and acquisitions. And last, the potential criticism. So while generally positive, some critics\n\nmight argue the large buybacks are short-term boosts with uh to EPS without creating long-term value or the capital could have been better utilized for elevation. Uh there we go. Okay. So then we have the evaluate alternative use of cash. So this subtask right here was to assess the um alternative. So the special dividend all these things right down here which we'll talk about right here. So for the special dividend financial impact this would involve distributing a one-time significant amount of cash directly to\n\nthe shareholders. This would reduce the company's cash versus equity. Uh strategic implications. This would signal that the company may not be compelling internal or external investment opportunities to yield for higher returns than returning cash to shareholders. um the alignment with shareholder value creation. So directly returns cash to shareholders providing immediate liquidity uh and tangible return on the investment and then again we'll get to the driver stuff at the end. I have it all written\n\non somewhere else. Um also about debt reduction. So the financial impact using cash to reduce debt lowers interest expenses thereby improving that income. Um and the strength uh strengthens the company's balance sheet. Uh strategic implications. So a conservative financial strategy that prioritizes stability and risk reduction. It frees up the cash flow interest payments for future use and improves the company's financial flexibility overall. Um which is really nice. And then you also have the uh shareholder value\n\ncreation. So it creates value by reducing financial risk improving profitability due to the lower expense strengthening the company's financial foundation. We also have the financial impact. So investing in R&D is a operating expense that reduces the current income in the short term. Uh strategic implications so represents a commitment to innovation product leadership and sustained competitive advantage. And then the alignment with shareholder value creation. So a key driver of long-term shareholder value particularly\n\nfor companies in innovationdriven industries successful R&D can create entirely new markets. Um and then we have to analyze the impacts of both share repurchase and each alternative on various stakeholders including common shareholders. So the agency theory explores potential conflicts of interest between a company management and shareholders. So the 90 billion share repurchase is the EPS bonuses. A share repurchases reduce the reduce the number of outstanding shares which is uh pretty good. We also have\n\nthe stock option value uh which is a repurchase can boost the share price due to increased demand and improve EPS thereby increasing the value of stock options. And we have increased ownership concentration which is a reduced share account and can be increased by percentage ownership. Some issues or conflicts with this would be short- termism. So this would focus on the uh acc creation for repurchase and incentivizing management to prioritize short-term financial metrics. It can also misuse of cheap stocks and it has the empire\n\nbuilding versus payout which would management might prefer to retain the cash for investments and increase the size or scope of the company. Um it also the alternative capital allocation strategy. So we could do management incentives which would have a less direct benefit but a special dividend directly distributes cash to shareholders without directly impacting the EPS or the stock option values in the same way that a repurchase would. uh you have shareholds. So this can be seen a strong uh signal\n\nof financial health and commitment to shareholder returns. We also have management incentives. So long-term growth and innovation. So an acquisition and high growth area like AI/VR could align with the management's long-term uh vision. We also have benefits management versus shareholders. So this can potentially benefit both if the acquisition is strategic and well executed which is very nice. Uh then you have conflicts and alignment. So potential for significant conflict in if the acquisition is not in the best\n\ninterest of the show shareholders. Um and then we also have value creation. So value creation refers to actions that generate new economic uh benefits to improve future cash flows, enhance sustainability, competitive advantages or just increase the overall size. So we have increasing revenue, improving efficiency, streng strengthening competitive modes and strategic investments. We also have the value transfer. So returning capital to shareholders, debt repayment and changes in ownership structure. Actions like\n\nthat would shift the proportion of the ownership among the shareholders often influencing per share metrics without increasing the total firm value. So now to categorize kind of the capital allocation options, we have share repurchase which is primarily value transfer. We have special dividend which is primarily value transfer as well. AI/VR acquisition which is value creation, debt reduction which would be mostly value transfer and then incremental R&D which would be value creation. So the nuances and overlap. So share\n\nrepurchase is kind of the nuance which is primarily value transfer. A share repurchase can value grading if the company's stock is significantly undervalued by the market. So in that scenario buying back buying back shares at a low price effectively makes a high profitable investment for the remaining shareholders. Debt reduction although primary values transfer reducing debt can indirectly create value by lowering the cost of capital and dividends. So while a direct transfer of cash consistent dividends can signal\n\nfinancial health and stability which might attract certain investor segments. Um so the main question which is what is the comprehensive recommendation for Apple's 90 billion share repurchase and alternate alternative uh capital allocation strategy. So based on the you know the analysis that Gemini was able to do the 90 billion share repurchase is primarily a value transfer mechanism that benefits existing shareholders through increased EPS and concentrated ownership while also signal signaling\n\nfinancial health and management confidence. However, alternatives like AI/VR acquisitions and incremental R&D are crucial for the long-term value creation. So, it's recommended to kind of have a balanced approach for that. Maybe even a hybrid approach where you kind of use both. Um, okay. To talk about my driver framework because Gemini did not do this like right on the the prompt. I'm I just wrote it on this side. So, I'm going to read that for the D and the driver. So to determine our\n\nmain goal was basically to determine whether Apple should execute a 90 billion one-year share repurchase given its uh valuation stakeholders and alternative cash. That's the main goal of this whole assignment. That's what we're trying to figure out. Um the R. So what matters basically for this is like we have financial effect of buyback. Is stock undervalued or fairly priced? Is it stakeholder you know incentives or you know stuff like that? And so the plan kind of what that would be to\n\ncompute shares retired and EPS changes assess the cash and leverage impact um size and special dividend alternative compare strategic alternatives etc and etc. So to kind of implement that what uh we did is we made buyback kind of math. So this is kind of where the code comes in. Um we have shares retired, percentage of shares, implied earnings, new shares, new EPS, cash after buyback. All these figures that we have put into the code that can help us if we manipulate the figures can change and give us a better understanding of what\n\nto look at. Um so to kind of evolve that a little bit further, we also added shareholders. So the benefits of tax efficient returns EPS would only rise but only arithmetically. So retailer holders would prefer stability and it would be buybacks are greater than special dividends for taxes and this kind of just uh scoped it out a little bit further. So there's more to it and more understanding built in for that. Um and then to kind of reflect also so we learned that a full 90 billion buyback yields small EPS uplift which is\n\nthe uh increase in 3.24% 24% but materially drains the liquidity. Uh at the current valuation, buybacks don't really create value. They're going to more likely return it for them. Apple benefits from just keeping the dry powder for a high ROI AI/VR and their Silicone investments. And the optimal solution is probably a blended type of allocation like I talked about something maybe hybrid kind of using a little bit of everything. Um but that is the session 11 assignment. Hope uh you have a great day!"
