  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key factors affecting capital structure at an introductory level—current cash pile, tax benefits, flexibility, opportunity cost, and leverage—and ties them to a clear directional recommendation to buy. The Reflect stage explicitly frames the decision in wealth terms and supports the choice with conditions on affordability and horizon, meeting the thoroughness needed for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base case plus multiple sensitivities (mortgage points vs no points, appreciation at 0%/4%/6%, opportunity cost) and quantifies a clear breakpoint (7.8 years) for the points decision. The student connects those sensitivities to the buy vs. rent recommendation and demonstrates the DRIVER stages (REPRESENT → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE), showing thorough and actionable scenario/sensitivity analysis.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows a clear Discover stage with problem statement, stakeholder context, objectives, and specific inputs stated before listing the questions and proceeding to modeling/code. Because the D-stage was documented up front and preceded implementation, the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identified interest-related tax benefits and discussed leverage and outcome sensitivity, implying higher risk with borrowing. However, they did not explicitly connect debt to financial distress risk or deeply analyze the tax shield vs. risk trade-off, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on a personal buy-versus-rent decision and never analyzes agency conflicts across stakeholders or who gains/loses under different financing choices. While leverage is mentioned, it is in a household context and does not cover asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics relevant to shareholders vs. bondholders or buybacks. Hence, it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes buying as a leveraged investment and demonstrates how returns can be amplified via sensitivity to appreciation. However, they do not explicitly connect debt to fixed interest obligations and the resulting default risk; their risk discussion remains general. Thus, understanding is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.",
