  "transcript": "Okay, so today we are evaluating Apple's hypothetical $9 billion capital allocation proposal, which is a massive share repurchase against four alternatives that use cash. So I will determine whether this buyback creates genuine value or merely transfers it, or balancing critical stakeholders incentives. So the problem.\n\n Apple has excess of liquidity, which is 165 billion, and strong cash flow. The proposal is to spend 90 billion, nearly 10% of the market cap, on buybacks.\n\n The context. Crucially, we discovered a significant agency conflict. Management holds options with $170 strike price. Since buybacks mechanically boost EPS and stock price, management has a direct personal incentive to prefer the buyback over long-term investments, even if it's not the best strategic move for the company. Stage two, represent.\n\n So the plan, to evaluate this objectively, I built a transparent financial model to compare five distinct scenarios. Buyback, dividend, acquisition, debt reduction, and R&D. So we are judging these options on three criterias. EPS impact, which we're analyzing if it grows earnings. Financial leverage.\n\n does increase or decrease risk in value nature. Is it value creation or value transfer? Value creation meaning growing the pie. Meanwhile, value transfer is just for example, resizing the pie, but keeping the same amount. So now we're implementing it into the code. So the model, let's look at the engine behind the analysis.\n\n So the base case. First, the code establishes the baseline. It calculates a base net income of $95.58 billion derived from the current $185 share price. So the logic. Then the code processes the $90 billion allocation differently for each scenario. Here we have all the parameters. Here is the $185 current share price.\n\n Shares outstanding, which is 50.5 billion. Total debt, which is 110 billion. Cash and investments, which is 165 billion. The P and E ratio, which is 30. The assumed tax rate, which is 25%. And the assumed interest rate on debt, which is 3%. Here we have the base case metrics.\n\n Here is the EPS, the net income, which is the base, both of them, the market value of equity formula and the proxy for book value formula. So this is the base case net income formula, which is the income divided by 1 billion and the base case EPS.\n\n Okay, so now to the scenario input. We're going to process the $9 billion allocation differently for each one. So we also have the $6 special dividend, very short.\n\n For the buyback, it's gonna calculate the shares repurchased, which equals 90 billion divided by price, physically reducing the share count. For acquisition, it's going to add estimated synergies directly to net income. And for debt reduction, it's going to subtract 90 billion from the total debt load, which is all of this. So now we have the results.\n\n so we see that the base case net income is 95.58 billion and the dividends is six dollars now for each scenario we have here the results buyback is 95.58 dividends 95.58 acquisition is 100 billion the reduction is around 97 and already 28.\n\n For each scenario, the EPS change. For buyback is 3.2. For dividends, it stays at zero. Acquisition, 5.2. Debt reduction, 2.1. And R&D, nearly 70%. So... Another is statistics from the results are...\n\n this part, which I'm going to explain it all like comparisons. The big difference is the ownership buyback is the only one that gets a plus 3% from these scenarios. So we see the buyback boost EPS by 3.2%.\n\n However, looking at the ownership concentration, it rises, like I just said. This confirms that this move is purely financial engineering, which means shrinking the share count to inflate the EPS number without improving operation profit. The acquisition is more of value creation. The acquisition gives us an EPS change of 5.2.\n\n this comes from adding real net income which represents true value creation so the buyback increases leverage and risk meanwhile another scenario is the debt reduction which almost eliminates leverage creating massive safety buffer for bondholders okay so\n\n In conclusion, the $90 billion buyback is a defensive measure that rewards management options and increases financial risk. My recommendation is to do a hybrid strategy. I recommend Apple to reject the pure buyback and implement a split approach, doing $40 billion in debt reduction and $50 billion in strategic R&D acquisition funnel.\n\n So this is going to de-risk, which means that the debt is going to pay down and satisfies bondholders and secures the balance sheet. And the other part is the $50 billion investment, which is going to ensure Apple stays competitive in AI and other stuff, driving long-term organic value, creating future growth.\n\n And this is going to eliminate the agency conflict by prioritizing company health over short-term stock price manipulation, which doesn't create value. It just, like I said at the beginning, it's like splitting the pie into different pieces. It's still the same pie.\n\n So that's my ultimate decision for Apple to focus on creating value, not just transferring it with, which was the original proposal of just doing the 9 million buybacks. Thank you for watching."
