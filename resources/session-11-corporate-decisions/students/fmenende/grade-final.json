  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital structure factors (large cash balance, existing debt, leverage/risk, bondholder safety, and financing costs) and evaluates how buybacks vs debt reduction affect risk and flexibility. They provide a clear directional recommendation (favor debt reduction via a hybrid approach) supported by their analysis. The depth and application across scenarios meet the standard for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly connects buybacks to management’s EPS/stock-price incentives (options) and highlights agency conflict with shareholders, then proposes an approach to mitigate it. Discussion is specific (option strike, EPS mechanics) and integrated across stages, demonstrating a thorough conceptual grasp suitable for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission provides transparent, traceable inputs in the code/notebook, computes and reports quantitative impacts (shares repurchased, EPS changes), and explicitly discusses option-holder incentives and bondholder risk. Those elements demonstrate thorough stakeholder-impact quantification and satisfy the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies that higher leverage increases financial risk and that debt reduction de-risks, satisfying the risk side of the trade-off. However, they never mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield), leaving the trade-off incomplete. Hence, correct but incomplete coverage merits a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies management-shareholder agency issues and notes bondholders benefit from deleveraging while buybacks raise risk, but coverage is incomplete. They do not address employees or large holders explicitly and provide only a basic treatment of asset substitution/risk‑shifting dynamics. Conceptual understanding is evident but not thorough, warranting a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links financing choices to risk and return by stating buybacks raise leverage/risk and debt reduction lowers it, and by showing EPS effects. However, they do not explain how leverage amplifies both gains and losses or that debt adds fixed interest obligations that increase default risk. Coverage is conceptually correct but not thorough, warranting a PARTIAL.",
