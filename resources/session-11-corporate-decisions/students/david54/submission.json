  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Caden and this is my\n310 video assignment. For this I will\nbe acting as an independent analyst\nevaluating Apple's hypothetical 90 billion\nshare repurchase program and I will be\nusing the driver framework to structure\nthis analysis and this I using this I've\nbuilt my Python model to quantify the\ntrade-offs. So let's start with the\ndefine and discover phase. the core\nproblem here is capital allocation\nefficiency. We have a massive liquidity\nsurplus at 165 billion in cash and\ninvestments. And the management proposal\nis to deploy 90 billion into buybacks.\nso in my code I have defined\nI have defined the known of the input\nvalues as the cash available to 90 and\nthe share price to $185 which implies\nthe the P/E ratio of 30. and we have\n15.5 billion shares outstanding.\nHowever, the most critical variable I've\nadded here is the cash yield rate of 4%.\nThis is important because it's in\nthe current economic environment, cash\nisn't free. If we keep this 90 billion\ndollar, it earns interest. If we spend\non buybacks, we lose the interest\nincome. This creates a\nhigh hurdle rate for buybacks to\nactually create value. So the goal of\nthe script is to determine if the\nreduction in share count mathematically\noutweighs the loss of that 4% yield.\nSo moving to the represent phase, I need\nto map out a large logical map out the\nlogic for our three alternatives. I\nrepresented these as three distinct\nPython functions. First the calculate\nstatus quo. this represents do nothing. \nThe formula here\nadds the net income to the after tax\ninterest income from the 90 billion cash.\nI'm calculating the in interest\nincome by multiplying the cash by the\nyield rate and adjusting for the 21% tax\nrate. This established the baseline EPS.\nAnd then the next calculation\nis the calculate buyback right\nhere. here the logic changes the cash\ngoes to zero. So we lose that interest\nincome. However, the shared outstanding\ndecreases. I calculate shares bought by\ndividing the 90 billion by the current\nshare price of $185.\nThe new EPS is the original net income\ndivided by the lower share count. And\nthen finally the we calculate the the\nfinally calculate dividends. This\nrepresents a pure cash transfer. The\ncash goes to zero. So no interest income\nbut the share count remains exactly the\nsame. The value isn't here isn't in EPS\ngrowth, but in the immediate dividend\namount, the cash payment share per share\nthat I calculate at the end of the\nfunction. The structure allows me to\nisolate the variable and see exactly how\nthe math flows from each stakeholder.\nAnd now the third phase, implement \nI'm going to run\nthese functions and store the data in\nthe panda data frame so we can compare\nthem side to by side. So when I run the\ncode,\nthis is what we get. So let's look at\nthese results. The status quo EPS comes\nout to roughly\n$6.64.\nThis is because the cash pile is\ngenerating significant\ninterest income. Now you look at the\nbuyback scenario. The EPS rises to\nroughly \n$6.83.\nThis is an acceleration of the 3%. As an\nanalyst, I have to look at the I have to\nask is 3% EPS growth worth spending\nbillion dollars because the P/E\nis so high at 30 times and interest\nrates are decent at 4%. The buyback is\nbarely moving the needle.\nIt's technically\ncreative, but it's not a slam dunk.\nSo, contrast that with the special\ndividend, the EPS actually drops to\nroughly\n$6.45.\nBecause we have lost the interest\nincome, it doesn't it and don't reduce\nthe share count. However, look at the\ncash run column. We will be sending a\ncheck for $5.80 per share to every\nstockholder. This creates conflict for\nretail investors might prefer that\nguaranteed $5.80\ncash payment today and executive\nmanagement. However, this creates more\nvalue for them themselves via the\nbuyback row because it drives up the EPS\nwhich often triggers bonuses and\nsupports the stock price.\nfor their options.\nNow for phase four, validate. A model is\nonly as good as its assumptions.\nSo for the validate phase, I perform a\nsensitivity analysis on the valuation\nrisk. The biggest risk is\nto a buyback is overpaying. We are\nbuying at $185 an all-time high. I wrote\nthis code block to stimulate\nwhat happens if the market corrects and\nthe stock drops to $150 next year. I\ncalculated the value destroyed by taking\nthe shares we just bought by making them\ndown to the hypothetical price. The code\nshows that if the price were to drop to\n$150, we have efficiently destroyed $17\nbillion of shareholders capital. We\nbought high and the asset went low. This\nvalidates that when the buyback looks\nsafe, it carries massive valuation risk.\nIf Apple can't grow earnings fast enough\nto justify a 30 P/E,\nthis buyback is essentially lighting\ncash on fire rather than waiting for a\nbetter price.\nFinally, for evolve and reflect,\nI used simple\nconditional statements here to mimic my\ndecision-making process. the code\nchecks for the acceleration above a\ncertain threshold. Since the\nacceleration is low, only 3% and my\ndividend yield is high, the model\nsuggests a hybrid approach. My final\nrecommendation should not do the full 90\nbillion buyback immediately. instead\nauthorize the 90 billion to\nsignal confidence in the market.\nExecute it as an open market\nrepurchase only when the stock price\ndips to avoid that evaluation risk we\ncalculated in the validate phase and\nallocate a portion perhaps maybe like\n20% to a special dividend to satisfy\nretail investors who need\ncash flow.\nThis analysis proves that a 30 times P/E\nratio, a buyback, is primarily a tool\nfor governance and agencies\nconsolidating ownership and managing tax\nefficiency for large holders like Berkshire\nHathaway rather than a tool for\nintrinsic value creation. We are transferring\nvalue from the cash balance to the\nremaining stakeholders but at a very\nexpensive price tag.Thank you."
