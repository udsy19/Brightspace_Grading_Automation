  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Aaron Ghofski and this is\nmy session 11 assignment.\nI'll be evaluating Apple's proposed $90\nbillion share repurchase program. I'll\nbe using the driver framework to\nstructure the decision. And I'll walk\nthrough the financial financial\nmodeling, the stakeholder incentives,\nand ultimately whether the buyback\nactually creates value for Apple or\nwhether alternative uses of cash would\ndeliver more substantial long-term\nbenefits.\nSo I'll start with our define and\ndiscover section. So the central\ndecision we are analyzing is whether\nApple should execute a $90 billion\nbuyback, roughly 10% of its market\ncapitalization. According to the\nassignment, Apple currently holds 165\nbillion in cash and marketable\ninvestments. It generates 100 billion in\nfree cash flow annually and maintains a\nstock price of $185 with a price to\nearnings ratio of 30. There are 15.5\nbillion shares outstanding and the\ncompany carries $ 110 billion in debt on\nits balance sheet. The stakeholder\nlandscapes includes Birkshshire Hathway\nwith a 6% ownership stake, the CEO\nholding 3 million shares and a large\nbase of retail shareholders who tend to\nown around 100 shares each and the\nemployees with stock options price at\n$170.\nThe assignment directs us to determine\nwhether the buyback is value creating or\nsimply transfers value between\nstakeholders. It also asks us to compare\nthe buyback to a special dividend, an AI\nor BR acquisition, debt reduction, and\nan incremental R&D investment. The goal\nof the define stage is to surf surface\nthe financial tensions and agency\nconflicts that make this decision\nnon-trivial. The shareholders generally\nlove buybacks because they boost\nearnings per share. Executives may also\nbenefit as buybacks have a direct\nimmediate effect on stock prices, which\nin turn influences compensation.\nMeanwhile, bond holders and long-term\ninstitutional investors prefer financial\nstability, lower leverage, and capital\ninvestment that increases future cash\nflows. In other words, who benefits and\nwho pays depends entirely on what Apple\ndoes with that $90 billion.\nMoving into the represent stage of this\nanalysis, I map all of these inputs into\na structured decision plan. This\nincludes categorizing each stakeholder\nbased on what they are about. Retail uh\nshareholders look for short-term EPS\ngrowth. Institutional investors\nuh like Birkshshire prioritize long-term\ncompounding and cap capital allocation\ndiscipline. Executives are incentivized\nthrough stock performance. So they they\nbenefit directly from EPS accretion even\nif it's mechanical. Employees will with\noptions benefit as long as the stock\ntrades above\n170. and bond holders care about\nleverage, interest coverage, and credit\nquality. Representing these competing\nobjectives is essential because the\nsession 11 assignment requires us to not\njust calculate EPS, but also to\nacknowledge how these incentives drive\nreal world agency conflicts.\nWith this structure in place, I moved\ninto the implement stage where I built a\ncomplete Python model to simulate each\ncapital allocation option. This code\nthat you can see on screen here\ncalculates new earnings per share, the\nshare price under constant P& ratio of\n30, leverage mechanics, ROIC for the\nacquisition, and R&D options, interest\nsaving from debt reduction scenario, and\noverall changes in shareholder value.\nThe model also quantifies stakeholder\noutcomes, enabling each scenario to be\ncompared both financially and\nbehaviorally.\nWhen I run the buyback scenario, the\nmodel showed the $90 billion repurchase.\nAnd here you can see what the run would\nlook like.\nWhen I run the buyback scenario, the\nmodel shows that a $90 billion\nrepurchase reduces the share count\nsignificantly, thereby increasing EPS\nbecause the PE ratio stays constant. The\nshare price also rises, but this EPS\nimprovement is purely mechanical. It\ndoes not reflect any increase in Apple's\nunderlying cash generating ability.\nLeverage remains unchanged because the\ncompany is not reducing debt and\nfinancial flexibility declines as Apple\ncommits a significant portion of its\nliquidity to the repurchase.\nWhen I run the special dividend\nscenario, I find almost the opposite\noutcome. A $6 per share dividend\nimmediately reduces the stock price and\nbecause the share count remains the\nsame, EPS does not change. This is a\nclassic case of value transfer rather\nthan value creation. Retail investors\nreceive cash but Apple's strategic\nposition is unchanged. There's also no\nimprovement in leverage or long-term\nvalue.\nNext, the acquisition of offer is the\nmost significant financial upside\nbecause I model an acquisition ROIC\nabove the company's 8% WACCC. The\nincremental income from the acquisition\nraises net income, increases EPS, and\nboosts the stock price. This scenario\nalso lowers leverage because earnings\nrise faster than debt levels. The\nchallenge, however, is execution risk.\nExecution risk, I'm sorry. Acquisitions\nhave historically been high variance for\nlarge technology firms, especially when\nentering emerging markets like AI or VR.\nThe debt reduction scenario behaves as\nexpected. Paying down 90 billion in debt\nsaves Apple a substantial amount of\nafter tax interest. That increase in net\nincome also raises EPS and price and\nleverage improves dramatically which\nbond bond holders and institutional\ninvestors prefer. This is a low risk\nscenario that strengthens Apple's\nbalance sheet. Finally, the incremental\nR&D scenario also raises EPS. Though the\nmagnitude depends entirely on whether\nthe R&D actually earns a return above\nthe cost of capital. Conceptually, this\noption aligns the most with Apple's core\ninnovation strategy and provides a\nlong-term value without the high\nexecution risk of an acquisition. This\nbrings me to the validate section of our\nanalysis where I interpret the outcomes.\nThe buyback does increase EPS, but it\ndoes so without increasing economic\nvalue. The model shows that EPS growth\nis driven entirely by reducing the\ndenominator, the val the number of\nshares outstanding rather than by\nimproving returns on capital. This\nbenefit this benefits executives and\nshort-term shareholders, but it does not\nnecessarily help the enterprise. The\nacquisition R&D scenarios are the only\nones that create real value by\nincreasing future cash flows. Debt\nreduction improves Apple's long-term\nstability by lowering leverage and\nstrengthening the balance sheet. And the\ndividend, while appreciated by income\nseeking shareholders, does nothing to\nenhance Apple's strategic position.\nMoving on to the evolve section of our\ndriver analysis, it's where I take a\nstep back and I integrate these findings\ninto a broader corporate financial\nperspective. Capital allocation\ndecisions reflect not just financial\nmechanics, but also the company's\nphilosophy. A $90 billion buyback s\nsignals that the market that Apple\nrefers to return capital rather than\ndeploy it in growth opportunities that\nmay communicate a lack of confidence in\nmajor innovation projects. Conversely,\nincremental R&D and high ROC\nacquisitions communicate a long-term\ncommitment to innovation. Debt reduction\nsignals financial discipline which pre\npreserves credit ratings and\noptionality. So the evolve stage\nreframes the problem from what increases\nEPS today to what maintains Apple's\ncompetitive advantage over the next\ndecade.\nAnd our last section is the reflect\nwhere I consider what the most complex\npart of this analysis was. And I believe\nit was the tension between short-term\nshareholder preferences and long-term\nenterprise value creation. Buybacks are\neasy, immediate, and highly visible. But\nthe assignment makes it clear that good\ncorporate finance requires balancing\nstakeholder incentives with substantial\ngrowth. Based on my modeling and\ninterpretation, my recommendation is a\ncombination of debt reduction and\nincremental R&D with a moderated and\nmuch and much smaller buyback. Debt\nreduction and strength debt reduction\nstrengthens the financial foundation\nwhile R&D investment maintains Apple's\ninnovation pipeline and protects the\nhigh value multiples supported by future\ngrowth. This approach creates value\nrather than simply transferring it and\nbalances the interests of shareholders,\nmanagement, employees, and bond holders.\nThank you for listening to my session 11analysis assignment analysis. Thank you."
