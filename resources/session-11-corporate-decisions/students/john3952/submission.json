  "transcript": "Hi everyone. Today I'm presenting as an\nindependent analysis of Apple\nhypothetical 90 billion share repurchase\nanalysis.\nSo as an analyst, my objective here is\nreally to determine whether this buyback\ncreates genuine value or if it's merely\na transfer of value among stakeholders.\nand I'd like to consider alternative\nuses of this capital as well to help\nthem achieve their long-term\norganizational financial goals. So, I'm\ngoing to walk you through a complete uh\nanalysis using the driver framework and\nshow you how I arrived at my conclusion.\nSo starting first with define and\ndiscover the first part of the downward\nframework. The core question here that\nwe're trying to answer is should Apple\nbuyback is not should Apple buy back $90\nbillion in shares. Instead, it's more\ncomplex than that. It's does this $90\nbillion buyback create more value for\nApple stakeholders than alternative\ncapital allocation strategies as I'll go\ninto later. And does it align with\nmanagement incentives for long-term\nshareholder interest? There's a lot of\ndifferent factors that we have to\nconsider. So I'd like to get into a few\nprominent ones. The first being\nstakeholder mapping. I've identified key\nfive key stakeholder groups with\ndistinct interest. The first being\nretail share shareholders. They hold an\naverage of 100 shares and they\nconsequently consequently will care more\nabout the shareholder price and\nappreciation and earnings per share\ngrowth. Next is institutional investors.\nAs the prompt originally discussed,\nBirkshare Hathaway owns 6% of the\ncompany and so they'll be focused on\ncapital allocation discipline and\nlong-term return. Moving on to\nmanagement, this includes our CEO Tim\nCook with 3 million shares. So obviously\nhe's going to be incentivized with EPA\nEPS or earnings per share based\ncompensation. This is something to\nconsider when we're looking at agency\nconcerns.\nNext is employees. So employees have\noptions at $170 for a strike price and\nthe buyback could push shares above\ntheir strike creating value. And\nfinally, it's bond holders. Bond holders\nare the key and final group in our\nstakeholder mapping analysis. Bond\nholders are exposed to $110 billion in\nexisting debt. they will prominently be\nconcerned about leverage ratios and the\nrisk to credit.\nHere are the key metrics I plan on\nanalyzing based on capital structure\ntheory as referenced in our textbook. So\nI'll need to examine five main things.\nThe earnings per share impact and\nwhether pure mechanical or value\ncreating changes in leverage ratios and\nfinancial flexibility. our ROI on\ncapital versus cost of capital,\nour ownership concentration changes and\nagency agency cost implications which\nare essential to making any of this\nhappen. So onto our discovery phase,\ngathering our context. As the assignment\nstated, in our current state, Apple has\n$106 billion $165 billion in cash and\ngenerates 100 billion in annual free\ncash flow. Their shares trade at $185\nand there are currently 15.5 billion\nshares outstanding. This gives us a\nmarket cap of approximately $2.87\ntrillion.\nSo the price to earnings ratio of 30\nsuggests that premium valuation\nexpectations should be hold should be\nheld setters per throughout the\nassignment.\nThe $90 $90 billion buyback represents\nroughly 10% of a market cap. That's a\nsubstantial number and therefore\nsubstantial program with existing bet\ndebt of $110 billion. Apple's current\nnet passition\nis $55 billion. So some alternative\ncapital uses that we were given to\ncompare with the $90 billion special\ndividend. So reducing shares to $5.81\nper share. A strategic acquisition in AI\nor VR technology debt reduction. So\neliminating the 90 billion of the $110\nbillion debt\noverall. Um leaving us with $20 billion\nof debt left over. incremental research\nand development investments which are\ngoing to take longer uh amounts of time\nand since they have a longer time\nhorizon. So the critical assumptions\nhere that I'm trying to test is that our\nshare purchase price and I'll assume the\naverage here is $185.\nThen\nexcuse me.\nThen with financing, will Applea use\ncash or issue debt with their time\nhorizon is one year as the assignment\nstated and our market reaction. Will our\nprice per earn multiple remain at 30 go\ndown or go up?\nFinally, moving on to represent. So this\nis how I mapped out my analytical\napproach. So I've structured my model\ninto four inter interconnected modules.\nThe first one is buyback mechanics. So I\nneed to calculate shares repurchased.\n$90 billion divided by $185 is $486\nmillion shares. That means our new share\ncount of shares outstanding would be\n15.014\nbillion shares. Now this is a large\nreduction at 3.14%\nreduction in shares outstanding\nsomething for us to consider.\nModule two focuses on our shareholder\nstakeholder impact and analysis. So for\neach stakeholder group I'm going to\ncalculate the change in owners ownership\npercentage the change in EPS and\nearnings claim the change in wealth\nposition and the risk exposure\ntreatment. Finally or sorry for module\nthree alternative scenarios we're\nmodeling five different ones. A base\ncase which is no action done. The second\ncase which is our $90 billion buyback.\nOur third case which is the share\nspecial dividend. The fourth case which\nis the strategic acquisition. We're\nassuming a flat rate of 10% return on\ninvested capital here. And then our\nfinal strategy or alternative scenario\nhere is the debt paid down. This will\nshave save us and shave a lot a lot off\nof our interest expenses.\nFinally, moving on to module four, our\nvalue creation task. The critical\nquestion here is does the buyback change\nthe present value of future cash flows\nor just redistribute the existing\nvalues? And for my visual representation\nreally and when I get on the the\nimplement section of the driver\nframework I'll be able to showcase this\nmore clearly but I've built a Python\nbased financial model as you can see on\nthe screen with these key outputs. EPS\ncomparison chart across all different\nscenarios so you can see the changes to\nthe company's stock portfolio and how\nthey're looking in the market. the\nleverage ratio progression, stakeholder\nwealth impact table, value creation\nversus transfer analysis, and finally\nwith my anal my analytical logic flow.\nSo as I mentioned previously, I wanted\nto create a framework that isn't just\ncalculating the EPS impact, but it's\nreally interrogating whether this real\nwhether each of these decisions create\nreal value. So my logic flow is as\nfollows. Calculate the mechanical\neffects. Assess whether buyback is\naccredited at its current valuation.\nCompare the alternative on a risk\nadjusted basis. Evaluate agency and\nsignaling implications which can be\nderived from the stakeholder wealth\nimpact table. So really the um agency\nconsideration shouldn't be a shock at\nall. And then finally synthesizing our\nrecommendations.\nSo let's move on to implement. So\nstarting with the buyback scenario\ncalculations, as you can see on this\nmodel, we have all of our figures that I\nmentioned previously and our model pre\num parameters. This obviously can be\nupdated. So let's say we have an\nincrease in that uh financing. So our\ncurrent debt is going to significantly\nrise. That can easily be changed in a\ncalculation. And then our debt interest\nrates and the our financial assumptions\nare here on the right side. So I buy\nback scenario analysis. So with our\nshares we purchased as I mentioned it'll\nmake a 3.14% difference and decrease and\nour new share count will set up that\n15.014\nbillion sorry billion count. Um so our\nearnings per share actually will go up\nby 2.24% 2 4% which will benefit a lot\nof different shareholders except our\nbond holders. So for our value creation\nanalysis our vest our estimated value\nimpact is actually in the negative and\nthis is an interesting part of the model\nthat we need to consider and something\nthat I wanted to be highlighted in case\ndifferent aspects of the financial\nmetrics being inputed into the model\nchange. So that's why you'll see here a\nvalue destruction warning. The implicit\nreturn is below the cost of capital\nwhich is 8%. So this buyback really\ndestroys all the work that they've been\ndoing and approximately 4.2 billion in\nshareholder value. This is a significant\nhurdle and factor that we need to\nconsider. So here's the comparison um\nfor our dividend scenarios and the\nearnings per share impact from them. So\nthis is just remaining where we are.\nThis is the buyback. This is the change\nin dividend price. This is a potential\nacquisition and this is paying down our\ndebt.\nObviously, as you can see, our earnings\nper share decreases the most if we\nchoose the dividend uh option here. So,\nleveraging our impact across different\nscenarios, our debt to equity percentage\nin our company's entire portfolio is\ngoing to be represented here based on\nall of our decisions. Obviously, you can\nsee with our debt payown, our debt to\nequity ratio significantly decreases.\nAnd finally, on the stakeholder impact\nand our buyback, our retail stakeholders\nare going to gain the most from their\nownership percentage if after their\nscenario\nuh we go forward with the $90 billion\nbuyback decision.\nAnd same thing with Birkshshire, they\nthey increased slightly a bit of their\nownership of the company after revive.\nSo here you can see a um a detailed look\nat the analysis of our stakeholders and\nhow they change in terms of their\nownership and their earning value. And\ninterestingly enough here our CEO does\nchange a bit at 3.24%.\nHowever, it's uh a bit negligible\nalthough pretty great.\nUm and then completing with our scenario\nsummary. So with EPS, we'll have a base\ncase, a buyback, a dividend acquisition\ndebt plown,\nand you can see all of these um\ndifferent figures listed here and the\ncritical value assessment. So the\nbuyback from our model destroys value\nand then from our dividends it's a\nneutral transfer and doesn't impact\nmuch. Our acquisition creates value and\nour debt payown obviously reduces risk.\nThe insights that we have show us that\nvalue creation for a value creation\ntest. The buyback implicit return of\n3.3% versus the weighted average cost of\ncapital of 8% means that we're going to\nend up in value destruction. So our earn\nper share grows at 3.2%. But this is\nmechanical and not really related to\ndirect economic value creation. That's\nwhy we can't just sit here and look at\nthis EPS growth rate and assume that\nwe're creating value in a company when\nin reality we're not. So finally, our\nbest alternative is acquisition. And\nwhile this might be surprising, it\nreally isn't because while the in the uh\nthe financing rate of 10% is relatively\nlow or a figure that we can keep track\nof and measure consistently,\nwe're going to create and generate a lot\nmore value for every stakeholder across\nthe board if there's acquisition of a\nnew partner or company.\nSo as far as agency concerned,\nmanagement benefits the most from an\nearnings per share value or sorry an\nearnings per share model. Um and\nregardless of the value creation, so\nthat could potentially lead to\nmisaligned incentives. Meaning that even\nthough with a buyback option or a sorry\nyes with a back buyback option that\ndestroys value our earnings per share\ngrowth increases significantly. However,\nI will like to um counteract that and\nsaying that our acquisition number at\ntheir EPS acquisition number is at a\nhigh way higher rate and we also create\nvalues. So this is why we are going to\nassume acquisition is the best option\nhere.\nSo for ownership concentration non sell\nshareholders\nare going to gain ownership without\ndestroying capital.\nSo as far as my validate section I\nneeded to test how my recommendation\nchanges under different assumptions. So\nif Apple's shares were fairly valued and\nif intrinsic value equals 185 and the\nbuyback still pay 30 times earnings um\nand so at 3.3% earnings yield versus an\n8% WACC it's still value destructive\nwhich is what we've represented here as\nwell. So if Apple can't find good\nacquisition targets, this doesn't make\nthe buyback situation good, it actually\njust makes it less bad relative to doing\nnothing, which is our base case here\nrepresented. And so the dividend\nalternative is a good uh place to land.\nAnd I would also argue the debt payown\nis also a good place to land.\nAnd then so if our buyback signals any\nmanagement confusion or agency concerns,\nI would refer back to the signaling\ntheory which suggest that buybacks\nindicate undervaluation.\nBut at a price for earnings ratio of 30\nor price per earnings rate of 30, this\nis credible signaling.\nThis is credible signaling. So the\nmarket may interpret this negatively\num like Apple doesn't have any more use\nfor $90 billion but in reality it's uh\ncreating\nmore value if we choose to do something\nrather than leaving it. And so the\ntradeoff theory as for the agency theory\nvalidation the management incentive\nalignment fails. So the CEO benefits\nfrom the EPS like I mentioned without\ncreating value and for the shareholder\ndebt holder conflict there's moderate\nconcern if debt is financed but free\ncash flow agency is another issue that\nwe have to be concerned with so valid so\nApple has excess cash but u buyback\npremium prices don't really solve it\noptimally\nso just with a reality check here in\nhistorical context companies with higher\nprice for earning ratios often faced\ncriticism for buybacks at elevated\nvaluations. For example, Microsoft and\nothers have faced similar scrutiny. From\na professional CFO perspective, a CFO\nconsidering this situation and buyback\noption would ask the following question.\nWhat's our true cost of capital? What's\nthe intrinsic value per share? Do we\nhave better strategic uses? and what\nsignal does this send to the larger\nmarket and stakeholders? My analysis\nsuggests Apple CFO should reject this\nbuyback at current prices.\nFinally, moving on to evolve,\nI would like to refine and re my\nrecommendation and consider\nimplementation nuances. Rather than a\nblanket rejection or approval, I\nrecommend a modified capital allocation\nstrategy. Starting first with a smaller\nopportunistic buyback, 30 billion\npotentially instead of 90 billion\nexecuted only during price pullbacks\nbelow $165 per share. So, if we see a\nmarket dip at a price to earnings ratio\nof about 27%, that would be the ideal\nwindow to shoot for an opportunistic\nbuyback at a way lower rate than 90\nbillion. Second, with an enhanced\ndividend strategy, we can increase\nregular quarterly dividends by 15%\ndeploying 15 billion annually. Third,\nwith strategic reserves, we can hold 30\nbillion for acquisition opportunities in\nAI semiconductor spacees.\nUm, and this allows us to also provide\num extreme intrinsic and exttrinsic\nvalue from that we would normally get\njust from the acquisition opportunity,\nbut using that um buyback money to do\nso. So for debt optimization,\nwe want to refinance exist existing\ndebtree rates and maintain any financial\nflexibility we have.\nSo my rationale for evolution, my\ninitial analysis showed the $90\n$90 billion buyback is value destructive\nat $185.\nHowever, Apple generates hundred billion\nX FTF annually. The capital must be\ndeployed. Smaller buybacks at lower\nprices can create value and combining\nmultiple capital uses provides balance.\nNow to address the stakeholder concerns.\nSo we reduce agency concerns about\nmanagement self-interest\nmainly from\nuh marketing and publicizing that\nbenefit from dividend increase. So\npredictable income plus opportunities\nlike buybacks benefits retail investors\nand institutional investors can\nappreciate the discipline and not\noverpaying for a uh an M&A decision and\nor buyback management. Um they have\nreduced agency conflict through a\nsmaller buyback plus a dividend\nobligation.\nAnd then for bond holders finally we get\nto maintain credit quality.\nSo what did I learn to this analysis?\nMoving on to reflect. So my key learning\nis that EPS or earnings per share is\nsort of a misleading measure. The\nbuyback increases ES by 3.24% as we've\nseen. But it doesn't sound it while it\nsounds positive, it's not completely\npositive. So you have to look beneath\nthe surface for metric. The true test is\nwhether value is created relative to the\ncost of capital. And at a 3.3% earnings\nyield versus an 8% weighted average cost\nof capital, this is value destruction\ndisguised as EPS growth. And that's not\nproductive. One of the other key things\nI learned is that a agency costs are\ncompletely real and need to be\nconsidered when making financial\ncorporate decisions. The management\nholding 3 million shares and likely\ncompensated on an EPS decision would\ncreate a conflict of interest right\naway. They benefit personally from\nbuybacks and even when shareholders\nwould be better served by alternatives.\nThis reinforces why governance and an\nindependent board oversight matters\nwith my third key learning assumption\nhere is that valuation context is\ncritical. So buybacks aren't inherently\ngood or bad. They're just dependent on\nvaluation. At a price earnings ratio of\n15, this buyback might create value. at\na price burn earning rate 30 it destroys\nvalue that's why timing in the markets\nmatters tremendously\nand finally stakeholder impacts diverge.\nSo the buyback benefits some ster\nstakeholders like management and\nnon-felling shareholders have while\npotentially harming others like selling\nshareholders who exit at sales inflated\nprices and new investors who inherit\nhigher leverage\ncan display to us the issue and\ndifferent conflicting interests any\nimpact that capital allocation decisions\nhave on all of our stakeholders. So\ncapital allocation isn't just about\nefficiency, it's about fairness and\nvalue distribution.\nThank you so much for listening. I'm soglad I have you as opposed to me to talk"
