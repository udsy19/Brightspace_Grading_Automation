  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly shows a Discover stage with problem definition and stakeholder documentation before the student states and runs Stage 2 (Represent) and subsequent modeling. This meets the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly listed required input data and defined multiple modeled scenarios and metrics in the Represent stage, then produced concrete calculated outputs for those scenarios in Implement. This shows a systematic plan and clear linkage from plan to implemented artifacts, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript shows systematic execution of the planned analysis through multiple, traceable scenarios (buyback, dividend, acquisition, debt reduction), explicit numeric calculations (shares repurchased, total dividend cost), and intermediate checks (new EPS aggregation, table/visual outputs). This aligns with a PASS under the moderate standard for demonstrating an organized, methodical implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student qualitatively recognized that leverage affects financial risk (credit rating and cost of debt), but never identified the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Because the trade-off requires both sides and the tax shield is missing, this does not meet the criterion despite the DRIVER-aligned scenario discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission references agency risk and leverage effects only at a high level and does not identify how shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders are differentially impacted under each option. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage and buybacks. Given the moderate standard, the treatment is too superficial to pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic grasp by linking debt reduction to lower leverage and risk (credit rating, cost of debt) and by noting EPS accretion as a return effect. However, they do not explicitly explain that leverage amplifies both returns and losses nor that debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. Coverage is correct but surface-level, warranting PARTIAL.",
