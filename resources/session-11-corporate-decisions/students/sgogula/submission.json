  "transcript": "0:02\nHi and this is my WVA1.\n0:06\nMy presentation focuses on evaluating\n0:08\nthe financial impact of the proposed 90\n0:11\nbillion share repurchase and comparing\n0:12\nit to several alternative use of cash\n0:15\nincluding a special dividend debt\n0:17\nreduction and strategic investments like\n0:19\nAI VR acquisition and R&D expansion. The\n0:23\ngoal is to determine which capital\n0:24\nallocation strategy creates the most\n0:26\nlong-term value, minimizes risk, and\n0:29\naligns with stakeholder interests. I'll\n0:32\nwalk through four main stages in total.\n0:34\nParsing and preparing the init uh core\n0:37\nfinancial data, modeling the share\n0:39\nrepurchase scenario, evaluating\n0:41\nalternative scenarios, and visualizing\n0:44\nand interpreting ST stakeholder impact\n0:46\nimpacts and delivering a final\n0:48\nrecommendation based on both qualitative\n0:50\nand quantitative factors.\n0:54\nSo to begin I extracted all the relevant\n0:57\nfinancial data from the capital\n0:59\nallocation snapshot and proposal\n1:01\nsections.\n1:02\nThese include liquidity, free cash flow,\n1:04\nshare price, PE ratio, dividend yield,\n1:07\nshare outstanding tool debt and of\n1:09\ncourse the 90 billion buyback size.\n1:12\nBecause the original document was not\n1:13\navailable directly in this environment,\n1:16\nplaceholder variables were created in\n1:17\nthe model. In a real world setting,\n1:19\nthese would be replaced program uh\n1:21\nprogrammatically by scraping or parsing\n1:23\nexact values from the company's filings\n1:25\nor internal documents. And these will\n1:28\nallow us to build a consistent\n1:29\nfoundation for modeling all capital\n1:31\nallocation scenarios and ensuring apples\n1:33\nto apples comparison across outcomes.\n1:38\nNext, I modeled the financial outcome of\n1:40\ndeploying $90 billion towards share\n1:43\nrepurchases. Using the current share\n1:45\nprice of $185, the company would be able\n1:48\nto repurchase approximately\n1:51\n600 million shares\n1:54\nand reducing total shares outstanding\n1:56\nfrom 7 billion to 6.4 billion. EPS under\n2:00\nthe current structure is calculated as\n2:01\nshare price divided by the PE ratio\n2:04\nright here.\n2:08\nIn this case, $6 per share. Because net\n2:10\nincome is held constant, reducing the\n2:12\nshare count mechanically boosts EPS.\n2:15\nAfter the rep purchase EPS increases to\n2:17\n$6.5.\n2:18\nThis is one of the primary reason\n2:20\nreasons companies pursue buybacks. They\n2:22\nincrease per share metrics without\n2:23\nimproving operational performance.\n2:25\nHowever, the trade-off is that liquidity\n2:26\ndrop sharply from 10 billion down to 10\n2:29\nbillion down to 10 billion. Debt remains\n2:31\nunchanged at $200 billion. So leverage\n2:33\neffectively increases relative to cash.\n2:36\nFrom a stakeholder perspective, this\n2:37\nmove benefits stakehold shareholders in\n2:39\nthe short term, especially those focused\n2:41\non EPS-based compensation or valuation\n2:44\nmultiples, but it also reduces financial\n2:46\nflexibility and increases exposure to\n2:48\neconomic downturns.\n2:51\nIn the next section, I first these are\n2:55\nalternative scenarios. The first one is\n2:58\na special dividend. A $6 per share\n3:00\nspecial dividend results in a total\n3:01\npayout payout of 42 billion reducing\n3:04\nliquidity to 48 58 billion. Unlike a\n3:08\nbuyback, shares outstanding stay the\n3:10\nsame. EPS does not increase.\n3:11\nShareholders receive immediate cash\n3:14\nvaluation.\n3:17\nRight here, this represents a value\n3:20\ntransfer, not value creation. It\n3:21\nbenefits shareholders who prefer current\n3:23\nincome but does not strengthen long-term\n3:25\nearnings capacity. The second scenario\n3:27\nis debt reduction scenario. If the\n3:29\ncompany instead used 90 billions uh $90\n3:31\nbillion to reduce debt, total debt would\n3:33\nfall from 200 billion to 110 billion\n3:36\ngenerating annual interest savings of\n3:38\n4.5 billion assuming a 5% average\n3:40\ninterest rate. This improves leverage\n3:42\nand reduces future obligations directly\n3:44\nincreasing firm stability and indirectly\n3:46\nsupporting long-term valuation. EPS\n3:48\nremains the same initially but will\n3:50\ngradually rise as interest expense\n3:51\ndeclines. This approach prioritizes\n3:53\ncredit health and long-term resilience\n3:55\nover short-term shareholder payouts. The\n3:58\nthird one is AIVR acquisition and R&D.\n4:01\nSo I modeled two strategic reinvestment\n4:03\nscenarios. The AIVR acquisition\n4:05\naccelerated R&D spending. Each scenario\n4:07\nuses the same $90 billion as the\n4:10\nbuyback. Liquidity falls to 10 billion\n4:12\nidentical to the repurchase and debt\n4:14\nreduction cases. The difference here is\n4:16\nalthough qualitative these scenarios may\n4:18\ncreate long-term competitive advantage\n4:20\nthey introduce execution risk they their\n4:22\nreturn depends on innovation cycles\n4:26\nmarket adapt adoption and integration\n4:28\nboth options present potential value\n4:30\ncreation\n4:32\nrather than value transfer but returns\n4:34\nare uncertain and depend heavily on\n4:37\nstrategy alignment and project\n4:38\ndiscipline\n4:40\nto compare scenarios side by side I\n4:42\nconstructed a financial metric summary\n4:44\nacross all cases this share outstanding\n4:46\nEPSA uh cash and liquidity total debt\n4:49\nannual interest savings total payout and\n4:51\noutflow or cash outflow and here's that\n4:54\nthe visual comparison highlights three\n4:56\nmajor insight share repurchase produces\n4:58\nthe largest immediate EPS boost from $6\n5:00\nto $6.5\n5:02\n$6.56 debt reduction delivers the\n5:04\nstrongest long-term financial\n5:05\nimprovement with $4.5 billion in annual\n5:08\ninterest savings and a dramatically\n5:09\nlower debt load strategic investments\n5:11\npreserve EPS but potentially unlock\n5:14\nfuture growth though with higher\n5:15\nuncertaintity and execution risk. A\n5:18\nsecond visualization focused\n5:20\nspecifically on EPS makes trade-offs\n5:22\nvery clear.\n5:25\nSo buyback materially lift EPS. Other\n5:29\nscenarios keep EPS flat initially.\n5:33\nUh a debt reduction will increase EPS\n5:35\nover time and strategic investments\n5:39\ndefer EPS to the future.\n5:48\nAnd here's all the cases.\n6:09\nSo bringing these analysis together, we\n6:11\ncan now form a comprehensive\n6:13\nrecommendation. The company's optimal\n6:14\ncapital allocation strategy should\n6:16\nbalance immediate shareholder value,\n6:17\nlong-term financial resilience,\n6:19\nresilience, future competitive\n6:21\npositioning, agency and governance\n6:23\nconsideration. So first share repurchase\n6:26\nit is it is best for short-term\n6:28\nshareholder value and EPS enhancement.\n6:30\nHowever, it severely reduces liquidity\n6:32\nand increases financial risk. It is\n6:34\nprimarily a value transfer not value\n6:36\ncreation. Uh special dividend it's\n6:39\nprovides instant value to shareholders\n6:41\nbut does not strengthen the business.\n6:43\nThis is purely a value transfer. Debt\n6:46\nreduction. It delivers true value\n6:47\ncreation although it has lower leverage.\n6:50\n$4.5 billion annual interest savings\n6:52\nreduced financial risk through trillions\n6:55\nexpansion improved credit quality and\n6:57\nthe strengthens the company structurally\n6:59\nwithout sacrificing long-term strategic\n7:01\noptionality. And the last one, strategic\n7:03\nAI VR investment plus R&D uh expansion.\n7:08\nThese are highest potential value\n7:09\ncreation options but also the highest\n7:11\nrisk. They should be only pursued after\n7:13\nthe company secures a healthier balance\n7:14\nsheet position ideally following partial\n7:17\ndebt reduction rather than all in\n7:18\npurchase. As the final result, the\n7:20\noptimal allocation strategy is a h I\n7:23\nbelieve it to be a hybrid approach. Uh I\n7:25\nwant to prioritize debt reduction to\n7:27\nstrengthen the balance sheet. design a\n7:29\nscalable and\n7:32\nuh disciplined investment program for\n7:34\nAIVR and R&D and I want to defer or\n7:36\nlimit share purchases repurchases until\n7:39\nliquidity builds and leverage is\n7:40\nrestored to target ranges. This strategy\n7:43\npreserves shareholder value today\n7:44\nenhance um financial flexibility and\n7:47\npositions the company for long-term in\n7:50\ninnovative growth.\n7:53Thank you."
