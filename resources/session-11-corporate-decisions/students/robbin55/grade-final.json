  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the problem and stakeholders at the start (Discover) and then describes performing the math/modeling (Represent/Implement) afterward, meeting the requirement that Define & Discover be completed before modeling. Evidence is direct and front-loaded, satisfying the strict explicitness standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated a clear plan of metrics and required data (variables and assumptions) during the Represent stage and then showed implemented outputs (code and scenario comparisons) in Implement. This shows a systematic linkage from planned models/options to implemented artifacts, meeting the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student moves from a stated representational plan (math and assumptions) to concrete execution (\"I also made code\") and produces multiple scenario outputs (current, buyback, debt reduction), showing a systematic implementation that traces to the original plan and decision objective. This meets the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never identifies the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield), only listing “tax rate” as a variable without discussing its role. Risk is mentioned generically (“higher risk”) without clearly tying it to debt or financial distress. Given the moderate standard, the lack of explicit tax-benefit discussion and only vague risk references lead to a fail on this specific criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Despite noting “players,” the student does not identify who gains/loses among shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders under each option, nor explain incentive divergences. There is no discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. The work focuses on scenarios/EPS without addressing the agency conflicts required for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes that financing choices differ in risk and impact EPS, comparing buybacks (implied higher EPS) with debt reduction (lower EPS, lower risk). However, they do not explain how leverage amplifies returns and risks nor mention debt’s fixed interest obligations or default risk. Given the moderate standard, this shows basic but incomplete conceptual understanding.",
