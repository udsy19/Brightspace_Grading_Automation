  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains that leverage amplifies returns and risk and explicitly notes the fixed interest obligation and its connection to bankruptcy risk. Multiple scenarios and a Python implementation deepen the treatment beyond surface-level discussion, satisfying the criterion at a PASS level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly contains a Define/Discover slide that captures the problem statement, stakeholders, and objectives up front, and the student then describes the Python model in a later Implement slide. This meets the strict requirement that D-stage be completed and documented before modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student presents a clear, systematic implementation: explicit assumptions, a coded model, multiple scenario runs, and calculated metrics (Net Income, ROE) that directly map to the Represent stage. The Validate step ties results back to the Represented theory, demonstrating traceable execution from plan to outcomes.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains that debt raises financial risk, supported by simulation results (Implement, Validate). However, they never identify debt’s tax benefits or interest tax shield. Given the moderate standard, this shows correct but incomplete coverage of the trade-off, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies divergent incentives among shareholders, bondholders, and management and links leverage to amplified equity outcomes, supported by modeling (Discover, Represent, Validate, Reflect). However, they omit employees and large blockholders and do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics (including buybacks). Thus the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates financing from operating effects and emphasizes value transfer (who bears downside/upside) with a model that holds operations constant. However, they do not discuss signaling effects of buybacks vs dividends vs acquisitions at all, leaving a major gap. Hence, correct but incomplete coverage warrants a PARTIAL.",
