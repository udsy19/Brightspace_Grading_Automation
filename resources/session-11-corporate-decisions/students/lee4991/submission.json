  "transcript": "00:00\nHello,  my name is Kayla Lee and I will do the set. I will explain the session 11 assignment about corporate financial decision analysis.  So to first start off, I will first define discover what this assignment is about.  So  we're evaluating Apple's hypothetical $90 billion  share repurchase using driver.\n\n00:25\nAnd we're going to act as independent analysts who must determine whether the buyback creates value relative to alternative uses of cash while balancing stakeholders incentives as well. So this is the information we have right now. So some of the parameters we have liquidity is $165 billion in cash and investments, $100 billion in annual free cash flow. The market context is $185 per share.\n\n00:53\nThe dividend yields 0.5 % and there's 15.5 billion shares outstanding. We have the balance sheet, the proposal and alternatives that you see right here. So we have a $90 billion buyback executed over one year, which equates to about 10 % of the market cap. We also have alternatives for $6 for the special dividends. And also with the balance sheet, we have $110 billion in debt and Berkshire owns 6 % of it. Our CEO holds 3 million shares and the retail investors average around her\n\n01:23\n100 shares each  and employees have  $170 strike options as well.  So  I'm going to recommend  and explain how the stakeholders impacts  and agency considerations and value creation versus value transfer outcomes  will affect this. So  I will determine whether the buyback creates value relative to the alternative uses of cash while  balancing stakeholders incentives as well.  Okay.\n\n01:52\nSo I use the Google Pro Gemini  to kind of help me give an explanation  on how to do this analysis. So let me pull that up.  So here I use the Google Pro Gemini to help me  give an analysis um and create the Python code  that I have right here.  And so  I'll leave that on display right here.  And  now I'll kind of...\n\n02:21\nyou know,  do an analysis on everything.  the essential question before  whether the buyback is generally maximized as a long-term shareholder value or whether these funds would be better allocated across alternative initiatives,  all while balancing the sometimes conflicting incentives of various stakeholders.  this analysis, I will compare the buyback to four primary  alternatives.  The $6 per share dividend, a strategic acquisition or incremental R &D investment  and\n\n02:50\nthe debt reduction and a no action scenario  while I'll use driver technique.  So at the defined stage, we established the core financial context in the frame of the analytical problem. So  like I  said, right here. So for Apple,  Apple,  the proposed $90 billion buyback  represents a nearly 10 % of Apple's market capitalization. Therefore,\n\n03:18\nWe currently hold $165 billion in liquidity and generates approximately $100 billion in annual free cash flow  and carries $110 billion in debt, which I said before.  Therefore,  its stock trades at $185 per share, supporting an EPS of $6.17 with 15.5 billion shares outstanding, implying a P to E  ratio of roughly 30.  The proposed $90 billion buyback represents nearly 10 %\n\n03:47\nof Apple's market capitalization, like I said earlier, necessitating careful comparison against the four alternative uses of capital.  This evaluation incorporates three primary financial theories.  Let me show  this.  So now this is the model  and there's more  size suit between the bondholders, employees,  management,  institution holders and the retail  shareholders.\n\n04:16\nSo the three primary financial theories, the agency theory, which examines alignment of management  incentives with shareholder interest signaling theory, which anticipates how the market interprets each capital allocation decision and the distinction between value creation and value transfer as well,  recognizing that not all shareholder gains are equivalent in terms of economic impact.  So at the represent stage, we outlined the analytical approach using a transparent parameterized financial model to simulate the first order effects of each scenario.\n\n04:45\nwhile holding net income constant in the initial period to isolate the impact of capital structure adjustments.  Key metrics, so here,  I represented this by using the Google Pro Gemini to help me  create the Python code and give me an idea of like kind of what's going on with the situation.  And I'm implementing that by having  this em financial model right here  and the charts right here, which I will go more in depth in in a minute.\n\n05:13\nUm, and so the key metrics include the change in the EPS to implied stock price, which you can see right here. Okay. Implied stock price, ownership concentration and leverage measured as net debt to the EBITDA and implement implications relative to Apple's walk. All assumptions are explicitly documented. The buyback executes at the current $185 per share. And you can see that right here.\n\n05:42\n$185 per share funded entirely from cash reserves ensuring executive visibility into the underlying mechanics. Implementing this model, the $90 billion buyback repurchases approximately 588 million shares, reducing total outstanding shares from 15.5 billion to 14.92 billion. And raising the EPS from $6.17, and then you see $6 to $0.37, so it increases. A 3.2 % increase, actually.\n\n06:10\nSo the implied stock price rises to $190.99 based on the  unchanged PE multiple and the institutional ownership concentration increases by 3.24 % mechanically,  reflecting a value transfer to large shareholders who now hold a slightly larger  portion of the company without additional capital outlay.  Retail shareholders benefit from the immediate price appreciation, higher EPS with tax deferral on the gains until sales.  But this represents a redistribution of existing wealth rather than the creation of new value.\n\n06:40\nManagement and employees see alignment through in the money stock options as deeper intrinsic value enhances compensation, though agency risk emerge if decision-making prioritizes short-term EPS gains over sustainable strategic growth. Bondholders are largely neutral in the media term as leverage remains stable at 0.92 for the ratio of debt divided by the EBITDA, though long-term risk exposure could increase if cash reserves are depleted for recurring back.\n\n07:09\nSo here in the model, can see like the financial analysis of the capital allocation scenarios. So this case, we have all the scenarios here. If it's the base case, I mean, it's just nothing. But if it's a buyback repurchase for half a billion shares at $185, this is what the new EPS would be. The EPS impacts will be 0.2. And then the implied stock price would be, it would increase to $190. The ratio stays the same except for the debt reduction.\n\n07:38\nand it'll have an ownership change percentage, 3.2%. This shows the stakeholder outcomes and agency considerations with my tables right here as I implemented that  to represent what I'm explaining.  So again, the buyback, special dividends, acquisition, the debt reduction,  and then here it shows how each one's affected. So I'll move that there and then the models are there.  So  compared to the buyback,\n\n08:04\nA $6 per share special dividend delivers immediate cash to shareholders, totaling approximately $93 billion,  yet produces no EPS enhancement and does not change ownership concentration.  Shareholders face immediate taxation, representing another form of value transfer rather than economic value creation.  Retail investors enjoy instant liquidity, but institutional investors gain little beyond proportional distributions and management incentives do not materially shift,  limiting alignment with long-term strategic goals.\n\n08:33\nTurning to strategic acquisitions or incremental R &D investment, assume a 15 % ROIC, which the EPS rises to $6.82, and the implied stock price increases to $204.60. This scenario generates genuine long-term value creation rather than merely redistributing existing wealth, reflecting the potential to expand net income and strengthen competitive positioning.\n\n08:59\nManagement and employee benefits from alignment with the strategic objectives as successful execution translate to higher intrinsic company value and stock option appreciation. Agency risk remain if projects are poorly executed or fail to meet projected returns, but the potential upside of investments in AI, VR, or other performative technologies justifies this option relative to mechanical EPS gains from financial engineering. The debt reduction provides modest EPS improvement to $6.34. Right here. The last one.\n\n09:27\nraising the implied stock to $190.23, while materially lowering leverage to 0.17 for the ratio to debt. This approach significantly enhances bondholder security, reduces borrowing costs, improves credit quality, and signals financial prudence and disciplined capital management. While shareholder upside is limited relative to buybacks or R &D investment, debt reduction mitigates financial risk, preserves cash flexibility for future strategic opportunities, and strengthens the balance sheet, aligning incentives with long-term corporate stability.\n\n09:57\nThe no-action scenario maintains existing financial and operational metrics, but  forgoes the opportunity to influence EPS leverage or market perception through proactive capital allocation.  Moving to the validate stage, we analyze stakeholder outcomes under each scenario in detail.  Under the buyback, institutional holders see their relative ownership increase, enhancing influence without  additional capital commitment, yet this  gain  comes at the expense of retail shareholders,  who face diluted claims on future earnings as well.\n\n10:26\nManagement and employee benefits from in the money options reinforcing alignment with the EPS focused financial engineering rather than strategic growth highlights clear agency conflicts. Bondholders face elevated leverage risk and reduce financial flexibility. Debt reduction most benefits bondholders enhancing credit quality and financial security while maintaining a net cash position sufficient for future investments. Strategic acquisitions or R &D investment primary benefit shareholders over the long term through increased net income. Higher stock price and improved competitive positioning.\n\n10:56\nwhile also aligning management and employee incentives with sustainable growth, although execution risk remains.  The special dividends provide immediate wealth distribution, but fail to create new value or meaningful influence on other stakeholders as well.  These quantitative and qualitative observations  reinforce the theoretical distinction between value transfer,  typified by buybacks of dividends and value creation,  which is current through strategic investments in growth or discipline  financial management. So we can see that.\n\n11:25\nSo now since we implemented that using the model and kind of how it forces together between value creation and value transfer, now how does this evolve? And how we can validate that? We validated that also using the models. We analyzed the stakeholder outcomes and that evolves to emphasizing the market signaling effects of each capital allocation decision.\n\n11:51\nBuybacks may signal that management perceives the stock as undervalued or that internal growth opportunities are limited,  potentially undermining confidence in a long-term strategic vision.  Special dividends similarly signal a return of excess cash and limited growth ambition, potentially constraining investor  expectations regarding innovation.  In contrast, strategic acquisitions or R &D investments demonstrate proactive pursuit\n\n12:15\nof transformative growth opportunities,  increasing the probability of future net income expansion and higher long-term P &E multiples.  Debt reduction signals conservative financial management and capital discipline,  preserving flexibility and the strengthening balance sheet credibility.  These signaling effects are critical because short-term EPS gains, while mechanically impressive, do not equate to sustainable value creation.  A misalignment between market perception and strategic intent can introduce additional agency costs.\n\n12:43\nNow let me show you the models too so then you guys have a better idea.\n\n12:54\nHere's this one, then I'll move it. um And now as we reflect  on that,  the synthesized findings indicate that a pure $90 billion buyback should be rejected.  No,  don't do it.  It prioritizes immediate insider enrichment, increases leverage, depletes cash reserves needed for strategic initiatives and risks  negative signaling regarding growth prospects. So  the future of Apple's health.  Instead,\n\n13:21\nA hybrid capital allocation strategy optimally balances risk, growth, and stakeholder alignment.  This strategy allocates $45 billion  to incremental R &D  and targeting the initiative to drive future net income growth and returns expected to exceed Apple's walk,  thereby generating genuine value creation, which we want, not the value transfer.  The remaining $45 billion  is used to reduce debt, lowering leverage, preserving net cash at $55 billion, satisfying bondholder concerns,\n\n13:51\nand maintaining financial flexibility for future opportunities.  This hybrid approach aligns incentives across stakeholders, management, and employees retain upside through ongoing innovation and stock performance.  Institutional and retail shareholders benefit from sustainable growth and a stronger balance sheet. And bondholders gain security and reduce exposure to financial risk as well.  By integrating capital structure and principles, agency theory, considerations, signaling effects, and rigorous financial modeling, oh\n\n14:18\nThis approach maximizes the long-term shareholder value while minimizing agency conflicts and negative market interpretation as well.  Now,  I'm going to explain some more about the quantitative metrics, such as the EPS changes, just because I cut it through into long numbers, and I want to explain that a little bit more.  So the stock price movements, leverage, and ownership shifts  are directly connected to stakeholder outcomes,  providing a holistic understanding of trade-offs inherent in each scenario. The buyback primarily facilitates value transfer to equity\n\n14:47\nholders with moderate signaling benefits.  Acquisitions or R &D investments  create long-term value contingent on successful execution.  Debt reduction and emphasizes balance sheet strength and discipline risk management.  And dividends provide immediate cash without  strategic growth benefits. And agency theory insights clarify that management and employee incentives are most strongly aligned under R &D investment and partially under debt  reduction.\n\n15:13\nwhereas buybacks and dividends primarily enrich insiders without creating new economic value.  Signaling theory illustrates that market interpretation of each allocation can reinforce or undermine long-term growth perceptions,  with strategic investment conveying ambition and prudence signaling stability.  Evaluating  both first-order financial metrics and second-order stakeholder and signaling effects ensure decisions are grounded  in a comprehensive evidence-based framework.\n\n15:40\nNow in conclusion, the hybrid capital allocation strategy outperforms any singular  alternatives. You can see that with the models here. And then  here shows like the retail shareholders, the institutional shareholders,  the management employees. So you can see more in debt about how, you know,  this, the  share increases for the employees,  how the debt is unaffected for the bondsholders.  So in conclusion,  the hybrid capital allocation strategy outperforms any singular alternative.\n\n16:09\ncombining financial discipline, strategic foresight, and alignment of stakeholder interests.  It supports sustainable value creation rather than simple wealth transfer and enhances Apple's competitive position and preserves balance sheet strength,  while simultaneously addressing agency concerns and managing market signaling.  This approach ensures that capital deployment maximizes long-term shareholder value and aligns incentives across management, employees and investors as well,  and positions Apple for continued innovation, financial resilience, and responsible corporate governance.\n\n16:39\nBy emphasizing a balance of strategic growth, financial prudence, and stakeholder alignment,  Apple can achieve superior long-term performance, maintain leadership and innovation, and mitigate risk associated with concentrated financial engineering or short-term  performance focus as well.  Ultimately, this disciplined evidence-based allocation framework creates measurable value for shareholders, strengthens the company's competitive and financial position,  and aligns incentives across all stakeholder groups and positions Apple for sustainable growth,  innovation leadership,\n\n17:07\nand  responsible corporate stewardship over long term as well.  As an end result, like I said,  we should reject it.  Following through  with  the driver, so this is the model  I use and I really liked how  it showed a lot about the comparison between them  and how, you know, with implied stock change and  the post...\n\n17:35\ntransaction EPS would be affected  between these different options. The special dividend wouldn't even have uh a change with the stock.  And then here also same thing with the ownership concentration change  and the ratio as well between the capital allocation strategy  between these two.  Here is like leverage and ownership. This is the EPS and implied stock price impact by the scenarios.  So as a result,  we should reject that and focus more on the value creation instead of\n\n18:05\nuh the value transfer in that case  and that's the best bet for Apple  and that is my explanation  for  session 11."
