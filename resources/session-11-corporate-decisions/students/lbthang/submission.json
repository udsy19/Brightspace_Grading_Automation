  "transcript": "0:02\nHi, my name is Law and for today's\n0:04\nassignments video uh we are on session\n0:07\n11\n0:10\nassignment corporate financial decision\n0:13\nanalysis. So today I am acting as an\n0:17\nindependent analysis to evaluate Apple's\n0:21\nproposal for a 90 million share uh share\n0:26\nrepurchase program with the 165 billion\n0:30\nin liquidity. The question isn't just if\n0:33\nthey can afford it but whether a buyback\n0:36\ncreates intr intrinsic value compared to\n0:40\na special um dividend. I will be using\n0:43\nthe the driver framework to analyze the\n0:47\nthe financial impact and stakeholder\n0:50\nincentives.\n0:52\nSo here we're on my notes. This is the\n0:55\ndiscover\n0:57\nwhat I just talked about our incentives,\n1:00\nour preference and pretty much it. So I\n1:05\nbasically summarize that. Okay. So let's\n1:08\nstart with\n1:11\nwith the discover. I talked a little bit\n1:13\nabout this but to go explain it better.\n1:17\nThe core uh friction here is the\n1:20\nagency's problem. We have three distinct\n1:23\ngroup with um conf conflicting interest.\n1:26\nThe first management\n1:30\nuh the CEO holds options that are\n1:33\ngenerally don't receive dividends. their\n1:36\nwealth is tied to\n1:39\nstrictly to stock price appreciation.\n1:42\nSecond, we have institutional investors\n1:45\nlike Brockshare, Hathway. They prefer\n1:49\nthey prefer buybacks\n1:52\nto defer taxes and compound their\n1:54\nownership percentage.\n1:57\nThirdly,\n1:59\nthe retail um investors who often\n2:03\nprefer cash income. My hypothesis is\n2:06\nthat that that buyback is the preferred\n2:10\npath because it aligns\n2:12\nthe two most powerful groups management\n2:15\nand institution.\n2:20\nOkay. Going to the represent scenario\n2:22\nplanning analysis framework.\n2:26\nI have designed a model to test uh four\n2:29\nscenarios. the baseline status quo,\n2:33\noption A, the buyback retiring um shares\n2:36\nat 185 and option\n2:41\nB which is special dividend paying cash\n2:44\nout directly and we have option\n2:48\nC which is down here\n2:51\nwhere we\n2:54\nso investing so basically investing for\n2:56\ngrowth to evaluate these I will\n2:59\ncalculate um not just\n3:03\nEPS but specifically the wealth impact\n3:06\non the CEOs to quantify the agency\n3:10\nconflict.\n3:12\nAll right, for our implement section\n3:19\num I've set Apple's cash at\n3:24\n165 billion and shares at 15.5\n3:28\nbillion.\n3:30\nThe the logic here is that I've\n3:33\ncalculated that spending 90 billion\n3:36\nretires about 3% of the outstanding\n3:38\nshares\n3:41\nand the conflict is crucially in the\n3:43\ndividend scenario. My model adjusts the\n3:46\nstock price down by the dividend amount.\n3:49\nthe highlights. Well, basically this\n3:52\nhighlights that unless the co has\n3:54\ndividend protection on their option,\n3:57\nthey lose value in the dividend um\n4:00\npayout.\n4:02\nIn the validate stage, the results um\n4:05\nconfirm the hypothesis. Looking at the\n4:07\ntable here,\n4:10\num the EPS, the buyback increases EPS to\n4:13\n$660\n4:17\nwhile the dividend actually lowers it\n4:19\nlowers it due to the due to loss\n4:22\ninterest income. This is the key in the\n4:25\ndividend scenario. The CEO um\n4:28\neffectively\n4:29\neffectively loses capital value in the\n4:34\nbuyback scenario. The CEO sees a wealth\n4:37\nincrease and this confirms that the\n4:40\nbuyback is\n4:42\num incentive compatible decision for our\n4:48\nleadership.\n4:51\nOkay. So with the with the implement to\n4:54\ngo back to this I made a\n4:59\nI made a python.\n5:03\nSo for the implement value here I put a\n5:09\nI asked Gemini to make me a Python code\n5:13\nwhich models model the quantifier of the\n5:18\ntrade-offs.\n5:19\nSo first looking at the inputs I've set\n5:22\nApple's parameters here to 165\n5:27\nbillion in cash and stock price at 185.\n5:32\nI also included that the CEO's\n5:35\nincentives 3 million shares in options.\n5:37\nThis is critical for our agency\n5:40\nanalysis.\n5:41\nSo let's go down to the buyback\n5:45\nhere. So in the calculation engine the\n5:49\nmodeling the mechanics for the buyback\n5:51\nthe code calculates how many shares we\n5:54\ncan retire which is about 3% of the\n5:57\ncompany for the dividend. The model\n6:00\nstimulates the cash leaving the balance\n6:02\nsheet but and this is key. It it also\n6:08\nadjusts the stock price down by the\n6:11\ndividend amount.\n6:14\nOkay, scroll down\n6:17\ntowards the\n6:20\noutput table. So this leads us to\n6:24\nthe most important finding in the output\n6:27\ntable.\n6:28\nLook at um look at the row. So if we\n6:32\nlook at the row where it says CEO CEO\n6:34\nwealth right here in the dividend\n6:37\ncolumn, the CEO's wealth actually drops\n6:40\ncompared to\n6:43\nthe baseline because the stock price\n6:45\nadjusts downward and options\n6:49\ngenerally don't receive dividends in the\n6:52\nbuyback column. However, the CEO's\n6:55\nwealth is protected and potentially\n6:58\nit grows. So this math math proves that\n7:02\nthe agency conflict the CEO um has a\n7:06\nfinancial distinctive to choose the\n7:08\ndividend making the buyback the only\n7:11\nincentive compatible choice\n7:15\nfrom our\n7:17\nfrom our code here. Let's go back to our\n7:19\nnotes.\n7:23\nAll right, we talked about the\n7:25\nimplement.\n7:28\nSee you. Give me one moment. Let's see.\n7:30\nMake sure we do this\n7:33\nthe concepts. I think correct capital.\n7:38\nOkay, we did that. We did the\n7:39\nimplementation.\n7:42\nYes, we did this.\n7:46\nWe did this. Okay.\n7:49\nAll right. Let's go back to our notes\n7:52\nhere.\n7:55\nHere are our key findings.\n7:58\nHere we have the key findings there. And\n8:01\nfor\n8:02\nOkay, so war evolve um strategic uh\n8:08\nimplications.\n8:10\nSo let's evolve beyond the math. So\n8:14\nbuying back stock at P\n8:18\ndivided by E 36 30 signals confidence\n8:24\nmanagement is saying we believe we are\n8:26\nstill under value\n8:29\nand for the governance\n8:33\nthe board must weigh the risk of buying\n8:34\nat the top of the market. However, a\n8:37\ndebt paydown was rejected because Apple\n8:41\nis already cash positive. Paying down\n8:43\ndebt would be um inefficient.\n8:48\nOkay. And that is for our evolve. And\n8:51\nfor a reflect um to finally\n8:55\nto reflect I recommend Apple proceed\n8:57\nwith the 90 billion share repurchase\n9:01\nwhile a dividend\n9:03\nuh pleases retail investors the buyback\n9:06\naligns the investors\n9:08\num\n9:10\nI'm sorry while the buyback aligns with\n9:13\nthe the interests of the CEO and major\n9:17\nshareholders like Bshshire Hathway way\n9:21\nat the way it creates tax efficient\n9:24\nvalue and sports EPS growth. The most\n9:27\ncomplex part of this analysis was\n9:30\nquantifying the the agency in incentives\n9:34\npro proving that a dividend would\n9:37\nactually penalize the CEO which makes\n9:40\nthe buyback the logical choice for my\n9:43\nanalysis.\n9:45Thank you."
