  "transcript": "Hello everyone. Uh today we'll be\n0:02\nevaluating a $90 billion uh share\n0:05\nrepurchase plan from Apple, a\n0:08\nhypothetical one. So we're going to get\n0:11\ninto the question now.\n0:14\nUm we're going to evaluate uh whether\n0:17\nthe buyback creates value relative to\n0:19\nother alternate uses of cash and uh\n0:23\nbalances shareholder value and\n0:25\nincentives.\n0:26\nUm, so for our capital allocation\n0:28\nsnapshot, we have $165 billion worth of\n0:31\ncash and investments, $100 billion of\n0:34\nannual free cash flow. Um, the market,\n0:37\nthe share price of Apple is $185. It has\n0:41\na price to earnings ratio of 30, a\n0:43\ndividend yield of.5%.\n0:47\nUh, 15.5 billion shares are outstanding.\n0:51\nOn the balance sheet side, there is $110\n0:54\nbillion worth of debt. Um, Berkshire\n0:57\nowns uh 6% of the company. The CEO holds\n1:01\n3 million shares. Retailer investors\n1:04\naverage 100 shares and employees have\n1:06\n$170 strike options. So, our proposal is\n1:10\na $90 billion buyback executed over one\n1:13\nyear and that's about uh 10% of the\n1:16\ncurrent market cap.\n1:18\nAnd some alternatives that we could also\n1:20\nconsider are $6 special dividend,\n1:24\na strategic AI/VR acquisition, debt\n1:28\nreduction, and uh incremental R&D\n1:32\nincreases in spending.\n1:34\nSo we're going to now deliver a\n1:36\nrecommendation that evaluates\n1:39\nstakeholder impacts, agency\n1:40\nconsideration, value creation, and value\n1:43\ntransfer outcomes. So we're going to\n1:45\ndefine the problem with the driver\n1:47\nmethod. So we're going to say how does\n1:49\nthis affect the capital structure? Are\n1:51\nthere better uses for cash? Um is this a\n1:54\ngood value? And are there any agency\n1:56\nproblems\n1:58\num between the managers and executives\n2:02\nand shareholders?\n2:06\nSo now we're going to represent um some\n2:08\nof the key key things. the capital\n2:11\nstructure impact. Um, we're going to\n2:14\nshift from $55 billion net cash to 75\n2:18\nbillion gross cash10 billion debt.\n2:23\nUm, and that's closer to neutral\n2:26\nleverage.\n2:28\nUm, we're going to model the outcome\n2:30\nbased on the stock valuation assumption,\n2:32\nundervalued versus overvalued linked to\n2:35\nvalue creations versus value transfer.\n2:38\nUm, we're going to see a stakeholder\n2:40\nincentive alignment and because we're\n2:42\ngoing to model EPS and option value to\n2:44\nassess agency conflict\n2:48\nand then so now we're going to look at\n2:51\nthe implementation on the buyback and so\n2:53\nthe plans to execute a $90 billion\n2:56\nbuyback over one year. So for the\n2:58\nimmediate uh financial impact cash is\n3:01\nreduced from 165 billion to 75 billion.\n3:05\nUm obviously this is a $90 billion uh\n3:08\ndecrease.\n3:09\nUm shares outstanding is also reduced\n3:12\nfrom 15.5 billion to 13.95 billion which\n3:16\nis uh good for our shareholders because\n3:18\nthey get more value. Um and immediately\n3:20\nboosts earnings per share and returns on\n3:23\ninvestment just because there's now uh\n3:27\nless shares. So now you know you have\n3:31\nearnings divide by shares there's now uh\n3:34\nless shares so the denominator is now\n3:37\nsmaller which makes a bigger earnings\n3:39\nper share number. Um so then uh by this\n3:43\nmethod we're going to recommend the\n3:46\nimplementation of the buyback. Uh this\n3:49\nis kind of contingent on the belief that\n3:51\nApple stock is undervalued.\n3:53\num if it was overvalued um there'd be no\n3:56\nneed to reward shareholders and it would\n3:59\njust lead to you know the stock falling\n4:01\nlater if people would just sell us but\n4:04\nsince the stock uh we believe to be\n4:08\nundervalued it'd be a good use of uh\n4:10\ncapital\n4:12\nand uh you can also see the calculation\n4:15\nin this uh Python code\n4:19\nthat was created with the help of Gemini\n4:22\nuh\n4:24\nwe have all of our key assumptions\n4:27\nand variables and uh then we will we\n4:31\nscale\n4:33\nuse a scale factor to input the the\n4:36\nbillions. So the 165 is 165 billion\n4:40\nand uh it's going to establish a\n4:42\nstarting point and with the initial\n4:44\nearnings per share\n4:47\nand the initial uh D / E ratio.\n4:52\nSo for the buyback scenario, we'll have\n4:54\nthe share reduction first, which is the\n4:56\nshares purchased equals the buyback size\n4:59\nuh divided by\n5:01\nuh the initial shares purchased. And\n5:03\nthat leads to new shares outstanding.\n5:06\nAnd then that creates the earnings per\n5:08\nshare boost, which is new earnings per\n5:10\nshare divided by equals net income\n5:14\ndivided by new shares outstanding.\n5:17\nAnd this also changes our leverage, how\n5:19\nrisky the business is. Um because when\n5:22\nyou take on uh when you have less cash,\n5:26\nit's harder to pay debt. So um we have\n5:29\nour new cash equals initial cash minus\n5:32\nbuyback size and our new debt to equity\n5:34\nratio is a debt divided by equity minus\n5:37\nbuyback size. Um so this is going to\n5:41\ncalculate how the buyback uses cash to\n5:44\noptimize the capital structure.\n5:46\nUm, we're also going to look at the\n5:49\nalternative scenarios because we have\n5:51\nopportunity costs we need to think\n5:53\nabout. So, there's going to be a debt\n5:55\nreduction efficiency test. Um, that's\n5:59\ngoing to look at net incomes, how it\n6:01\nchanges due to interest savings from\n6:03\nreduced debt. And we're going to see\n6:05\nthat the increase is minimal because tax\n6:08\nadvance, interest savings are usually\n6:10\nmuch smaller than uh small EPS boosts.\n6:13\nAnd we're also going to test the special\n6:14\ndividend that we talked about earlier.\n6:17\nUm, we're going to calculate the cost of\n6:19\nthe dividend. And we're going to see\n6:21\nthat uh the dividend results in a zero\n6:24\nchange to earnings per share. And this\n6:27\nkind of highlights the BEX superiority\n6:29\nand maximizing a per share earnings.\n6:33\nAnd so now that we have all that, uh,\n6:36\nwe're going to run the code.\n6:40\nScroll down.\n6:43\nAnd so here you can see kind of the\n6:45\nresults of the code and the capital\n6:48\nallocation model with our uh PE multiple\n6:53\nand the implied price. So you can see in\n6:57\nthe base case 165 billion everything\n6:59\nkind of stays the same.\n7:01\nUm and then we have our $90 billion\n7:04\nbuyback.\n7:06\nSo we have our postcash allocation of 75\n7:09\nbillion debt post allocation 110 billion\n7:14\nuh new EPS 6.37\n7:18\nup from 6.17\n7:20\nEPS change was 3.24%.\n7:23\nThe implied share price rises to $190.99\n7:27\nand our new debt to equity ratio is 04.\n7:31\nAnd you can see with the other options\n7:33\nhere, the $90 billion $90 billion debt\n7:36\nreduction. Um\n7:39\nwe have our same cash post allocation of\n7:42\nuh $75 billion being allocated. Um the\n7:46\ndebt is decreased to 20 billion. The net\n7:49\ncash is now 55 billion post allocation.\n7:54\nUm new shares outstanding still the same\n7:57\nas before. Nothing changes there.\n8:00\nuh do uh earnings per share is higher\n8:04\nthan the original but still lower than\n8:07\nthe share of buyback. Um so it's\n8:10\nincreased 2.82%.\n8:12\nAnd the implied share price is 190.23\n8:16\nwhich is still lower than our buyback\n8:18\nbut higher than our initial\n8:22\nscenario if we did nothing. And the debt\n8:25\nto equity ratio decreases because you're\n8:27\nlimiting debt. Um, so it's only 01,\n8:31\nbut uh since Apple already had a pretty\n8:33\nconservative capital structure, that\n8:35\nisn't something we need to worry too\n8:37\nmuch about. Um, so then we're also going\n8:39\nto look at the $6 special dividend. Um,\n8:42\ncash post allocation, $72 billion.\n8:46\nUm, the debt post allocation still the\n8:50\nsame. Um\n8:54\nwe're gonna have $ 38 negative 38\n8:56\nbillion dollar\n8:58\nof uh cash post allocation. The new sh\n9:02\nnew uh\n9:04\nshares outstanding is still the same as\n9:06\nbefore because that hasn't changed. But\n9:10\nthe earnings per share is also the same.\n9:13\nAnd because of all that, there's no\n9:15\nchange in earnings per share and the\n9:17\nimplied share price still the same. and\n9:20\nthen debt to equity ratio still the\n9:23\nsame. So, it's all the same uh as the\n9:25\noriginal uh scenario except investors\n9:27\nare now getting a $6 dividend which is\n9:30\nalso uh we'll talk a little bit about\n9:32\nthe the tax implications of that because\n9:35\nuh investors will be taxed on that $6.\n9:39\nUm but if the share price rises $6,\n9:43\num you know, you don't get taxed on\n9:45\nunrealized gains. So depending on who\n9:48\nyou are um that could be beneficial or\n9:51\nnegative.\n9:54\nSo in respect to leverage um which the\n9:58\ndebt debt to uh equity ratio kind of\n10:01\nrepresents um the base case you have 03\n10:06\num the buyback 039 the debt reduction\n10:09\ndrops significantly to 06 and the\n10:12\nspecial dividend uh still the same. Um\n10:16\nlike we said uh in all these cases the\n10:20\ndebt is reduced a lot when you uh do the\n10:23\ndebt reduction plan but it's already so\n10:25\nlow for a company like Apple and its\n10:27\nsize where um it's not extremely\n10:30\nsignificant when you have a debt to\n10:32\nequity ratio of 03. Um you're still\n10:35\npretty safe at that level. 06 a little\n10:38\noverkill for a company of Apple size.\n10:43\nUm so now going out of the code.\n10:47\nSo part of our assumptions is that uh\n10:50\nApple is not forgoing a superior AI\n10:53\nacquisition that could return a greater\n10:56\nuh yield than the cost of capital.\n11:00\nSo the buyback is only\n11:04\nuh valid if this assumption is true. If\n11:06\nyou could get a higher percent for\n11:08\nshareholders, you can increase revenue\n11:11\nby an acquisition.\n11:13\num this would be much better but we\n11:14\ndon't know uh that to be true. It's also\n11:17\nsome risk that um so the flexibility and\n11:21\nthe evolution of the company um the\n11:24\nbuyback le 75 billion of cash and 100\n11:27\nbillion of annual free cash flow. The\n11:29\nliquidity is kind of a buffer and allows\n11:31\nthe firm to evolve it strategy as needed\n11:34\nso they can pursue other opportunities.\n11:36\nThey're pretty flexible. They're not\n11:38\nvery cast constrained.\n11:41\nUm so and the risk validation um the\n11:44\nfinancial risk is still negligible\n11:48\nuh despite the large cash reduction just\n11:50\nbecause their balance sheet is very\n11:51\nstrong. So our f final recommendation is\n11:55\nto recommend uh the $90 billion share\n11:57\nrepurchase. Um this is because it uh\n12:01\nmanages capital well while moving the\n12:04\nbalance sheet more towards an efficient\n12:05\nstructure with a tax shield. It is tax\n12:08\nefficient for long-term shareholders\n12:10\ncompared to special dividend because\n12:12\nlike we said um when you issue a\n12:14\ndividend it's tax while unrealized gains\n12:16\nare not.\n12:19\nSo for non-selling shareholders like\n12:20\nBrookshshire it's a win because it's tax\n12:22\nefficient. Um management employed it's a\n12:26\nwin for them too because it boosts their\n12:28\noptions and then their share value. Um,\n12:32\nand Apple also wins because uh they're\n12:35\nrewarding their investors unless another\n12:37\nuh superior use of their cash was\n12:40\navailable to them.\n12:43\nSo, by balancing the positive financial\n12:45\nmetrics like earnings per share against\n12:47\nthe uh agency risks and opportunity\n12:50\ncosts, uh we'd recommend to do the $90\n12:53\nbillion share buyback. Thank you for\n12:55\nwatching."
