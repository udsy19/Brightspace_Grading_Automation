  "transcript": "uh for session 11, the core objective is\nto evaluate Apple's hypothetical 90\nbillion share repurchase plan against\nfour distinct alternative uses of cash.\nThe analysis must determine whether the\nbuyback creates value relative to the\nalternatives considering the incentives\nand impacts on various stakeholders.\nUm so the proposal is the 90 billion\nshare repurchase over one year and the\ncash source is primarily\nuh $165\nbillion liquidity and a hundred billion\nannual cash flow. The buyback is fully\nfunded by current cash. Uh the share\naccount would be 15.5 billion shares\noutstanding.\nUm\nand out of that we have all the values\nfrom the market cap which is at a 2.8675\ntrillion a PE ratio of 30 uh net income\nof 95.58 billion\num the debt being 1 sorry $110 billion.\nUh the stakeholders include the retail\nshareholders, institutional shareholders\nwhich is being burkshireare uh the\nmanagement employees and bond holders.\nSo in this assignment we require\nstructured analysis of a corporate\nfinancial decision and we're using the\ndriver framework for it.\nuh start\nuh we've already defined the problem and\nthis analysis must determine whether the\nbuyback creates value relative to the\nalternatives considering the incentives\nand impacts on various stakeholders.\nUm\nthe hypothesis and assumptions that I'm\ngoing to go ahead with is value\ncreation. A true value creating action\nincreases the fundamental intrinsic\nvalue of the firm. So while the transfer\nrelocates of existing wealth, the second\none would be a buyback impact. The\nbuyback will reduce share account and\nincrease EPS but may not create any\nintrinsic value if the shares are not\nundervalued or if the cash could be used\nfor a higher ROIC projects. Uh and the\ntechnical assumption here is that the\nbuyback will be executed at the current\nmarket price of $185.\nUm\ngetting back into this, this analysis\nrequires a comparative financial model\nthat can calculate key metrics for the\nbase case and all the five scenarios\nthat we're going to show you the Python\nmodel on Collab. Uh so the model\nstructure we're going ahead with is a\nsimple financial statement model with\nincome statement, balance sheets, key\nmetrics. Okay. Excuse me about that.\nOkay.\nYeah. Uh income statement, balance\nsheet, key metrics to quantify the\nimmediate impact of each of the 90\nbillion use of cash. Uh for\nparameterization the inputs include uh\nthe buyback size\nright here the $90 billion proposal\nshare price of 185 debt of 110 billion\nnet income of 95.58 billion and a\nprojected ROIC on investment for the\nacquisition and research and development\nalternatives which is a crucial\nassumption for this project.\nAnd here we are getting into\nthe coding of it all.\nSo right here we're setting up. This is\nthe same as it is as it has been for all\nof our previous projects. Uh we're\nimporting pandas and mattplot lib. Uh\nthis is from data manipulation and mplot\nli is for the plotting. Uh we have all\nof the capital allocation here and all\nthe derived metrics right here. Uh\nso the P ratio is the price to earnings\nratio and it's used to calculate the net\nincome. Uh the market cap initial the\ntotal value outstanding shares net\nincome being the implied annual net\nincome. Uh initial EPS earnings per\nshare at a starting point.\nOkay, the assumptions here again assumed\nROIC uh it assumed it like it's the\nassumed return on invested capital for\nthe new R&D acquisition investments.\nThis is crucial lab uh cost of debt\nsavings. We are assuming a cost savings\nrate if the debt is reduced.\nUh the are just general print statements\nand the results.\nSo as you can see the initial market cap\nis at 2.87 trillion implied annual\nincome is 95.58.\nUh this is where most of the coding\nhappens actually. Uh this is the core of\nthe analysis\nuh where different capital allocation\nstrategies are modeled and their\nfinancial impacts are calculated and it\nencompasses the represent and implement\nstages in the driver framework. So the\nfirst one being the calculate scenario\nfunction which is the workhouse of the\nentire cell. It creates takes a scenario\nname and several parameters\nuh including net income, new shares, new\ndebt, new ES, new market cap and\nleverage ratio\nwhich are highlighted here. Uh it\nreturns a dictionary containing all of\nthese calculated metrics. So the first\nscenario is a share repurchase. Uh\nmodels using the buyback size to\nrepurchase shares. This increases EPS by\nreducing the share count. The scenario\ntwo, it's a special dividend. The models\ndistributing cash as a dividend. This\nprimary affects cash balance shareholder\ndistribution but doesn't change any\nshares outstanding or net income\ndirectly in this model. Uh scenario\nthree is for strategic acquisition and\nR&D. The this model uses cash for\ninvestments expected to create value by\nincreasing net income. This is based on\nthe assumed ROIC new from the previous\none. This is a value creation scenario\nwith a higher risk or reward. Uh\nscenario four being debt reduction. This\nmodel uses cash to pay down debt. This\nincreases net income by reducing\ninterest expenses which is based on the\ncost of debt savings and lowers the\nleverage ratio. Um\ncoming to the last one which is scenario\nfive which is the balanced approach. It\ncombines elements of R&D uh investment\nshare repurchase and debt reduction.\nIt's an attempt to optimize all of the\nprevious scenarios to create value and\nbe more disciplined financially.\nUh and all of this has been\nturned into a data frame.\nuh which converts the dictionary of\nscenario results into a pandas data\nframe for easier viewing and as you can\nsee it's turned into a table\nall of this area right here so from the\nkey observations from this table would\nbe that from scenario one shows a 3%\nincrease in the EPS due to fewer shares\noutstanding\nuh resulting from primarily from a value\ntransfer mechanism\nuh special dividend And scenario two,\nthere's no change in the EPS. It's a\ndirect cash distribution without\naffecting earnings or share account in\nthis model. For scenario three, which\nentails the acquisition or R&D, it this\nprovides the highest EPS growth of 14%\ndriven by the assumed 15% ROC increasing\nnet income significantly.\nUh it's a clear value creation strategy\neven though it has a higher amount of\nrisk. Scenario four, it leads to 4% EPS\nuh increase due to the lower interest\nexpenses and a substantial decrease in\ndebt and leverage enhancing financial\nstability and reducing cost of capital.\nUh and now coming back to scenario five\nwhich is the balanced approach. It\nachieves a 9% EPS increase by strategic\ncombining R&D investment, share buyback\nand debt reduction. It also maintains a\nreasonable leverage ratio.\nUh now uh to the visualization where\nwe're uh doing the validated evolve part\nof the driver framework.\nUh this is the cell and I'm just going\nto show you the results right here\nbecause I guess it's more interesting.\nUh we're setting up the plot. Uh here is\nall the figure creation.\nUm subplot one shows the EPS impact.\nIt's a bar chart showing the percentage\nchange in EPS for each selected\nscenario. Uh this highlights the\nimmediate impact on shareholder value.\nSubplot two which is the leverage shift\na bar chart showing the debt to equity\nratio for each selected scenario. This\nindicates the impact on financial risk\nand bond holders.\nUm so our final recommendation which\nhere is in text it discusses all the\naccuracy of the financial concepts and\nuh identifies balanced approach as the\noptimal choice like although I would\nprobably go with scenario three with the\nacquisition research and development\nbecause it does create the highest value\neven if there's a considerable risk\ninvolved but sometimes you just got to\ntake\nUh so the EPS change percentage across\nkey scenario share of shareholder I\ndidn't want to talk about that for a\nlittle bit. Uh it shows that the as I\nmentioned the acquisition or R&D it\nyields the highest 14.12 percentage uh\nof an EPS boost. Uh the balanced\napproach also provides a strong increase\n8.83 83, but I don't think it's anything\ncompared to the R&D and acquisition\nhere. Sure, repurchase and debt\nreduction have more moderate but still\npositive impacts. Uh like there isn't\nreally a negative here. It's just you\ngot to pick what you want. This visual\nhelps uh stakeholders quickly grasp\nwhich options lead to the most\nsignificant potential increase in\nearnings per share. The leverage one it\nagain shows the leverage uh it\nhighlights that the debt reduction\nsignificantly lowers the debt to equity\nratio to 0.067\nindicating a much healthier balance\nsheet from bond holders perspective.\nUm\nother scenarios maintain a higher\nleverage with shares repurchase 8 3.84\n84 and acquisition 3.36\nwhile having comparatively higher\nratios.\nThis visualization\nI think it just helps a lot. It's a\nlittle bit more fun to do.\nSo the optimal choice at the end of the\nday is the balanced approach which is\nthe most effective strategy. It offers a\nrobust EPS increase as stated with 7.5%\nin text which is an approximation and\nmight differ slightly from the 8.83 in\nthe table due to rounding and emphasis.\nIt combines future growth opportunity\nshareholder returns and a balance sheet\nrisking presenting a well-rounded\nstrategy for turn balance.\nSo for the recommendation, I think the\ninitial analysis shows that the buyback\noffers the best short-term EPS boost and\nsatisfies a core shareholder demand\nwhile minimizing taxation.\nHowever, the acquisition and R&D options\noffer a true intrinsic value creation if\nthe ROIC assumption holds accurate um\nresulting in a higher longer term EPS.\nDebt reduction is also the safest value\ncreator here. And that would be it for\nthe final\nsession 11 assignment.Thank you."
