  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission documents concrete implementation steps (imports, a core calculate_scenario function, dataframe creation) and reports specific numeric outputs and plots that match those steps, indicating code was executed and validated. While full code text is not transcribed, the combination of implementation detail plus consistent quantitative results and visualization descriptions satisfies the introductory-level evidence requirement.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated cross-scenario comparisons using a parameterized function and centralized DataFrame/plots, avoiding manual replication. This covers buyback, dividend, acquisition/R&D, and debt reduction comprehensively, demonstrating strong, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student thoroughly describes both the table and the plots, citing specific scenario results and units (percent EPS change, debt-to-equity ratio) and interpreting stakeholder implications (bondholders’ risk). The narrative ties the visuals to capital allocation trade-offs across scenarios and is explicitly framed within DRIVER stages, satisfying a thorough, conceptually clear PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and discusses the financial risk side of leverage (higher leverage increases risk; debt reduction enhances stability), satisfying half of the criterion. However, they never identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield); their tax comments focus on buyback/dividend taxation instead. Hence, conceptual understanding is present but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student acknowledges wealth transfer in buybacks and the need to consider stakeholder incentives, and briefly references bondholder risk via leverage visuals, but does not map who gains/loses under each option or discuss management, employees, or large holders’ divergent incentives. Asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks are not explained. This shows basic but incomplete understanding, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly connects debt to fixed interest obligations and lower leverage improving financial stability, and they explicitly frame leverage (D/E) as affecting risk for bondholders. However, they do not thoroughly explain how leverage amplifies both returns and risks, nor explicitly mention increased default risk from fixed interest commitments.
