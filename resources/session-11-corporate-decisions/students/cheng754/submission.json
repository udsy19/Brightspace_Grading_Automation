  "transcript": "0:00\nOkay. Um, hello. My name is Michelle.\n0:03\nToday I'm going going to act as an\n0:05\nindependent analysist. I am I am\n0:09\nevaluating Apple's proposal to deploy\n0:12\n$90 billion toward a share repurchase\n0:16\nprogram. So, we'll be using the driver\n0:19\nframework. My goal today is to determine\n0:22\nif this buyback creates genuine value\n0:25\ncompared to alternatives like a special\n0:28\ndividend or a strategic strategic\n0:31\nacquisition.\n0:32\nWe are starting with a company that is\n0:35\ncashri but expensive. Apple has $165\n0:40\nbillion in liquidity but trades at a at\n0:44\na PE of 30. Our stakeholders have\n0:48\nconflicting interests. So right here we\n0:51\nhave listed that stakeholders like\n0:56\nBurkshshire Hathaway want ownership\n1:00\nconcentration.\n1:02\nEmployees holding options need the stock\n1:05\nprice to stay above their 170 strike\n1:09\nprice. And then lastly, the management\n1:12\nis incentivized to hit EPS targets.\n1:18\nSo obviously they have different goals\n1:21\nthat they want to reach. So moving to\n1:24\nthe represent section and implement\n1:26\nstages. I constructed a Python class\n1:30\ncalled capital allocation model to\n1:32\nstimulate the scenarios. I've set up a\n1:35\nmodel, the model to handle three\n1:37\ndistinct outcomes. The first one being\n1:40\nthe buyback where we retry\n1:44\nshares at current market price and our\n1:47\nsecond one is the special dividend which\n1:51\ntransfers cash directly but creates a\n1:53\ntax event and lastly an acquisition\n1:57\nwhere I've assumed a 10% return on\n2:00\ninvestment to test our growth potential.\n2:05\nSo we've run the model. So here's the\n2:08\nPython code and then you can see right\n2:11\nhere with the numbers as you can see in\n2:14\nthe output table right here the math\n2:16\nvalidates our initial hypothesis\n2:19\num regarding EPS accretion. Um the first\n2:23\none being in the baseline EPS is $6.17\n2:28\nand in buyback scenario EPS jumps to\n2:31\nroughly $6.37.\n2:34\nSo this happens because we are retrying\n2:36\nabout 486 million shares. However,\n2:40\nlooking at the special dividend while it\n2:43\nreturned the same amount of cash, it\n2:45\ndoesn't improve EPS. Furthermore,\n2:48\ntheoretically,\n2:50\num the stock price would drop by the\n2:52\ndividend amount on X dividend date. This\n2:55\nis crucial insight for employee\n2:57\nstakeholders in holding options\n3:01\nbecause a dividend lower the um when a\n3:05\ndividend lowers the stock price\n3:07\npotentially hurts uh which is\n3:10\npotentially hurting the value of their\n3:12\noptions whereas a buyback supports the\n3:16\nprice.\n3:17\nSo um moving on to evolve\n3:22\nthe analysis to look at agency theory\n3:24\nand ownership. So I've visualized the\n3:27\ntrade off right here. The blue bars show\n3:31\nthe EPS growth. But look at the red\n3:33\nline. This represents Brickshshire's\n3:37\nHathaway's ownership percentage. In the\n3:40\nbuyback scenario, their ownership stake\n3:43\nincreases by 6% to roughly 6.3%\n3:48\npassively. They didn't buy a single\n3:50\nshare, yet their claim on future cash\n3:52\nflows increased. So, this visual proves\n3:57\nthat the buyback is highly effective for\n4:00\nlarge long-term shareholders who want to\n4:03\navoid the immediate tax bill of a\n4:06\ndividend.\n4:08\nAnd um finally to my reflection and\n4:11\nrecommendations,\n4:13\nthey're right here.\n4:17\nUm\n4:18\nI recommend approving the 9 90 billion\n4:22\nbuyback but with a caveat regarding\n4:25\ngovernance.\n4:27\nUm from a value perspective, this is\n4:30\nvalue transfer, not value creation. We\n4:34\naren't making better iPhones. We are\n4:36\nsimply reslicing the financial pie.\n4:39\nHowever, it is the superior choice of a\n4:43\ncouple of reasons. The first one being\n4:46\nit aligns with management incentives to\n4:48\nboost EPS. Second one being the it\n4:52\nprotects employee option value by\n4:55\nsupporting the share price. And last but\n4:58\nnot least, it is more tax efficient for\n5:01\nlarge holders like Birkshshire.\n5:05\nHowever, because Apple is trading at a\n5:07\nhigh PE of 30, buying back stock now is\n5:12\nvery expensive. Therefore, the board\n5:14\nshould authorize the $90 billion by\n5:18\nexecute\n5:20\nexecuting it in trenches only when the\n5:23\nprice aligns with intrinsic value,\n5:26\nensuring we don't destroy wealth by\n5:28\noverlapping for our own stock. So this\n5:32\nconcludes my driver analysis and thank\n5:34\nyou guys so much for listening."
