  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies key capital-structure factors (large cash position, existing debt level, tax-adjusted low cost of debt) and assesses leverage safety, then recommends a buyback supported by scenario outputs. This shows a sound, applied rationale for an optimal direction at an introductory level, satisfying the criterion under moderate strictness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student connects the buyback to management incentives via EPS uplift and stock-price-linked option value, and explicitly identifies a conflict between management/option holders and income-focused shareholders. They discuss these points across DRIVER stages with quantitative references, meeting a thorough, conceptually sound treatment for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student addresses all primary groups—shareholders (EPS/buyback/dividend), management (option incentives), and bondholders/lenders (risk/leverage, net debt)—and also notes employees via option-holder impacts. Coverage is applied across scenarios and tied to the final recommendation, demonstrating thorough, conceptually sound stakeholder treatment appropriate for an introductory, moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student acknowledges the tax effect of debt (after-tax cost/tax adjustment) and qualitatively links debt levels to financial risk (“lower is safer,” debt paydown safest). However, the treatment is brief and lacks a deeper explanation of the tax shield versus distress costs trade-off, so it demonstrates correct but basic understanding, meriting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies some stakeholder incentive conflicts (employees/management with options vs income-focused shareholders) and links choices to leverage risk. However, treatment of bondholders and large holders is minimal and asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics from buybacks and leverage are not explained. This shows basic but incomplete coverage, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic, correct understanding that financing choices trade off EPS outcomes and risk, using EPS and net debt to illustrate. However, they do not explicitly explain that leverage amplifies both gains and losses nor that debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. Given the moderate standard, this is adequate but not thorough, so PARTIAL.",
