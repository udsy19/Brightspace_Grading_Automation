This is Jax Montgomery\n\n2\n00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879\nand this is my session 11 assignment.\n\n3\n00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800\nUm, basically the assignment is\n\n4\n00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880\ncorporate financial decision analysis.\n\n5\n00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,639\nSo, kind of brief overview on this is we\n\n6\n00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,799\nneed to evaluate Apple's hypothetical\n\n7\n00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,960\n$90 billion share repurchase using the\n\n8\n00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,199\ndriver method. Um, we're going to act as\n\n9\n00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960\nan independent analysis or independent\n\n10\n00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400\nanalyst who must determine whether the\n\n11\n00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880\nbuyback creates value relative to\n\n12\n00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,359\nalternative uses of cash while balancing\n\n13\n00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,279\nstakeholder incentives. Um and then our\n\n14\n00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439\ncapital allocative snapshot. Basically\n\n15\n00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280\nour context behind this is that we have\n\n16\n00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360\na liquidity.\n\n17\n00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600\nWe have $165 billion cash and\n\n18\n00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640\ninvestments 100 million annual free cash\n\n19\n00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,200\nflow. Our market context is 185 share\n\n20\n00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120\nprice PE30 dividend yield 0.5% and 50.5\n\n21\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520\nbillion shares outstanding. We have our\n\n22\n00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360\nbalance sheet our proposal and our and\n\n23\n00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559\nour alternatives.\n\n24\n00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760\nSo, I'll kind of cover when these are\n\n25\n00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,600\ninvolved with the code, but our goal is\n\n26\n00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,160\nto deliver a recommendation that\n\n27\n00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,239\nexplains stakeholder impacts, agency\n\n28\n00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,760\nconsiderations, and value creation\n\n29\n00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,760\nversus value transfer outcomes.\n\n30\n00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080\nSo, kind of started off my code, we use\n\n31\n00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,479\nthe driver format, and I'm going to run\n\n32\n00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,320\nyou guys through that.\n\n33\n00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400\nSo, we have our driver, we have our\n\n34\n00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920\ndefine and discover.\n\n35\n00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,720\nUm,\n\n36\n00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,479\nit's right here. We have our inputs. We\n\n37\n00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600\nhave inputs like price, shares, cash,\n\n38\n00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,759\ndebt, buyback budget, uh PE ratio, net\n\n39\n00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,159\nincome, interest rate, and tax rate.\n\n40\n00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,320\nThese will all be used in the implement\n\n41\n00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,759\nstage. Uh okay, so moving on,\n\n42\n00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920\nwe have represent which is basically our\n\n43\n00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,200\nplan.\n\n44\n00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720\nAnd I'll go more into this later.\n\n45\n00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560\nAnd then we have our stage three, our\n\n46\n00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,680\nimplement. This is our model. This is\n\n47\n00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360\nwhere we do our math. we do all of our\n\n48\n00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,360\ncode and all those good things. So I'll\n\n49\n00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,240\nrun you guys through that. So this is\n\n50\n00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,079\none of our this is our rent scenario\n\n51\n00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,200\nand basically this adjusts the balance\n\n52\n00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,520\nsheet. So it takes new cash which equals\n\n53\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,840\ncash minus cash used, new debt which is\n\n54\n00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,840\ndebt equals minus debt paid and then new\n\n55\n00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,399\nshares which is shares minus shares\n\n56\n00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,360\nretired. It also adjusts income\n\n57\n00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,120\nstatements um interest savings after\n\n58\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,840\ntax, new net income which is base plus\n\n59\n00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,480\ninterest savings plus ROI from R&D and\n\n60\n00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400\nwe also have calculate metrics.\n\n61\n00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,920\nSo we can see all our variables here\n\n62\n00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,400\nwhich is interest savings\n\n63\n00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920\nnew NI and then new EPS and new net debt\n\n64\n00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,959\nand this return basically gives us our\n\n65\n00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,959\nvalues on our\n\n66\n00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519\nand then we also have scenario toggles.\n\n67\n00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920\nSo our scenario one is buyback spend 90\n\n68\n00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,920\nbillion retire shares. Scenario two is\n\n69\n00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800\ndividend spend 90 billion no share\n\n70\n00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,280\nchange. Scenario three is debt payown.\n\n71\n00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,160\nSpend a 90 billion uh paying debt and\n\n72\n00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,160\nsave interest. And scenario four is R&D\n\n73\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,360\nacquisition spend 90 billion and assume\n\n74\n00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,800\n10% ROIC.\n\n75\n00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560\nSo we have scenario one, scenario two,\n\n76\n00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,920\nscenario three and scenario four and our\n\n77\n00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360\nROI income return investment income. And\n\n78\n00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,120\nthese are our four values that we'll use\n\n79\n00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,120\nlater. We also have a credit table.\n\n80\n00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560\nSo our when ask for visual, we have our\n\n81\n00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,239\nvisual here which creates a table. I'll\n\n82\n00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000\nshow you guys later. And then if you\n\n83\n00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,640\nwant to evolve this, we also have our\n\n84\n00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080\nevolve stage.\n\n85\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120\nSo if you wanted to include strike\n\n86\n00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,519\nprice, price buyback,\n\n87\n00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,959\num dividend per share, price dividend,\n\n88\n00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640\nuh EMP value buyback, EMP value\n\n89\n00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040\ndividend.\n\n90\n00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200\nWe have all those those as well. And\n\n91\n00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480\nthose values are calculated in our\n\n92\n00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840\nevolve if you want to take this one step\n\n93\n00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799\nfurther. And then we have our\n\n94\n00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,599\nvisualization which is our plotting. We\n\n95\n00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,360\nplot the EPS versus net debt risk and\n\n96\n00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200\nthis basically does all that. And then\n\n97\n00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640\nwe have a our reflect stage which is our\n\n98\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,799\nrecommendation what we think where we\n\n99\n00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,879\ndeliver our um input. So this is my code\n\n100\n00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,799\nthat I used. It has all the variables.\n\n101\n00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040\nIt includes all the calculations and\n\n102\n00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,640\nthen it sits down driver format which\n\n103\n00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,560\nI'll present to you guys now.\n\n104\n00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,200\nSo to kind of start it off, um our\n\n105\n00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640\nobjective is to evaluate Apple's capital\n\n106\n00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120\nallocation strategy acting as an\n\n107\n00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639\nindependent an analyst. Um our problem,\n\n108\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120\nwe must analyze a $90 billion\n\n109\n00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,120\nhypothetical share.\n\n110\n00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320\nWe must analyze a $90 billion\n\n111\n00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440\nhypothetical share um repurchase\n\n112\n00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,320\nrelative to alternative uses. Our\n\n113\n00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,400\ncontext is the firm holds 165 billion\n\n114\n00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520\nliquidity but carries 110 billion in\n\n115\n00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,600\ndebt. Our constraint is stock price is\n\n116\n00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,440\n185 PE30.\n\n117\n00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,120\nUm employees hold options with 17 $70\n\n118\n00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720\nstrike price.\n\n119\n00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160\nSo our calculated metrics and data from\n\n120\n00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,400\nthis is that stock price is 185. Our net\n\n121\n00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,440\nincome is 90 95.58 billion and our net\n\n122\n00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,120\ndebt is negative 555 billion. And this\n\n123\n00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,280\nnegative just implies that's net cash\n\n124\n00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800\nposition.\n\n125\n00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,720\nSo we defined this over there. Move on\n\n126\n00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720\nwhere we present our methodology for\n\n127\n00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880\nthis. Uh we will use utilize a Python\n\n128\n00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,440\nbased scenario engine to model five\n\n129\n00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,320\ndistinct futures. One our status quo.\n\n130\n00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,160\nTwo our buyback of 90 billion. Three are\n\n131\n00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,720\na special dividend of 90 billion and\n\n132\n00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160\nfour are debt payown of 90 billion. Um\n\n133\n00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600\nand then five are a strategic\n\n134\n00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,360\nacquisition 90 billion. Our key metrics\n\n135\n00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,039\nfor this um we will solve for EPS impact\n\n136\n00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,759\nnet debt leverage and a stakeholder\n\n137\n00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,400\nwealth transfer are calculated metrics\n\n138\n00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,479\nand data planned. So we're going to\n\n139\n00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,639\nbuild function uh run scenario to\n\n140\n00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,400\nautomate P&L adjustments. We're going to\n\n141\n00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:52,000\nplan to compare uh shareholder return\n\n142\n00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,080\nEPS versus bond holder risk leverage.\n\n143\n00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520\nSo this is where represent our data and\n\n144\n00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400\nthen where we actually implement it.\n\n145\n00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080\nThis is our scenario engine.\n\n146\n00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,240\nSo our model execution uh the function\n\n147\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720\nbelow adjust the balance sheet cash to\n\n148\n00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080\nequity and income statement interest\n\n149\n00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,479\nincome dynamically for each capital\n\n150\n00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,479\nallocation choice.\n\n151\n00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,639\nSo here are four are our three scenar or\n\n152\n00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,000\nfour scenarios. So scenario one uh which\n\n153\n00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,240\nis buyback we have an EPS of 6.37 EPS\n\n154\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,199\npercent change of 3.24 and a net debt of\n\n155\n00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,919\n35 million. Um scenario two dividend EPS\n\n156\n00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,000\nof 6.1\n\n157\n00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,160\nuh billion. Nope just 6.1. My bad. Uh\n\n158\n00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,160\nEPS percent change of zero and a net\n\n159\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,120\ndebt of 35 billion. our debt payown of\n\n160\n00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,199\nsix our EPS is 6.35 EPS percent change\n\n161\n00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,360\nis 2.98 and our net debt is negative 55\n\n162\n00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:56,160\nbillion and then\n\n163\n00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,639\nour strat acquire R&D uh EPS of 6.75%\n\n164\n00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,479\nchange 9.42% and a net debt of 35\n\n165\n00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,960\nbillion.\n\n166\n00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,160\nSo to validate this data um the buyback\n\n167\n00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,960\ndriver the buyback drives a 3.2% 2% EPS\n\n168\n00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,520\nincrease without operational risk. Um\n\n169\n00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,759\nthe strategic acquisition offers high\n\n170\n00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,759\nupside which is 10% EPS growth but\n\n171\n00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,759\nassumes a 10% ROI success rate\n\n172\n00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,240\nsuccess rate\n\n173\n00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000\nand then debt payown provides minimal\n\n174\n00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,800\nvalue due to the low cost of existing\n\n175\n00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,800\ndebt which is tax adjusted.\n\n176\n00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319\nSo\n\n177\n00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,240\nhere is\n\n178\n00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,280\nour driver stage um evolve\n\n179\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,599\nwhich is our stakeholder quantification.\n\n180\n00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,880\nSo agency analysis um calculating the\n\n181\n00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,560\ntransfer value between stakeholders. Our\n\n182\n00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,199\nconflict is employees and management\n\n183\n00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039\nhold options stuck at 170. Uh they\n\n184\n00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520\nbenefit from price appreciation which is\n\n185\n00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,240\nbuyback. income investors benefit from\n\n186\n00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,360\ncash payout dividend which lowers the\n\n187\n00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,879\nstock price and hurts option value. So\n\n188\n00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,879\nas you can see here here is\n\n189\n00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,199\nour visual.\n\n190\n00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,199\nSo this is our EPS\n\n191\n00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,199\nfor each option option one two three and\n\n192\n00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,520\nfour. Then here is our net debt.\n\n193\n00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960\nSo, as you can see for options one, two,\n\n194\n00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,000\nand four, it's all the same, but for\n\n195\n00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,000\noption three, it drops down.\n\n196\n00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:37,039\nUm, on our left hand, y axis is EPS and\n\n197\n00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,200\nthen our right hand is net debt uh\n\n198\n00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,599\nin billions, which just means lower is\n\n199\n00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279\nsafer. So, as you can see, debt payown\n\n200\n00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,640\nis the safest.\n\n201\n00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,000\nSo just to reflect on this um our\n\n202\n00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640\nrecommendation is to execute the $90\n\n203\n00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680\nbillion buyback.\n\n204\n00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,600\nUh this is because number one it\n\n205\n00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279\noptimizes capital structure. It\n\n206\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,320\nleverages\n\n207\n00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,200\nuh our leverage remains safe. It aligns\n\n208\n00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,120\nwith management employee incentives uh\n\n209\n00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,959\n20.94 option value and it also signals\n\n210\n00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,080\nconfidence whereas a dividend might\n\n211\n00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,080\nsignal a lack of growth ideas.\n\n212\n00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,920\nUm so that is my recommendation for uh\n\n213\n00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:32,200\nsession 11 assignment\n\n214\n00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,200\nand yeah thanks for watching."
