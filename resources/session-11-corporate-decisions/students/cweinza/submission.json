  "transcript": "Hello my name is Clara Weinzapfel, and today I'm going to be going over the\nsession 11 assignment. So I started\nreading through the assignment, copying\npasting it into Google Gemini, and\nhaving it create a Python code, which I\nthen put into Google Collab. So this\npresentation evaluates Apple's\nhypothetical 90 billion capital\nallocation decision. The analysis\nstrictly follows the driver framework\nand uses a custom Python model to\nquantify financial outcomes, which is\nthe core requirement of the assignment.\nThe structured approach is define and\ndiscover, represent, implement,\nvalidate, evolve and reflect. Our focus\nis demonstrating how the quantitative\nanalysis particularly the Python code\nsupports the financial recommendation.\nSo for stage one, define and discover,\nthe problem is defined as selecting the\noptimal use of $90 billion.\nKey financial data are gathered.\n165 billion in cash, 100 billion FCF\nand 110 billion debt. 15.5\nbillion shares at\n$185.\nThese data points serve\nas the initial parameters for the Python\nmodel.\nAnd here in this first lines of code,\nyou can see it outline those values.\nKey assumptions for modeling include\nfunding, the allocation with existing\ncash, an effective tax rate of 25% and a\npre-tax cost of debt of 4%. For\nstrategic alternatives, we assume an\nROIC of 10% for the acquisition and 5%\nfor the incremental R&D.\nThis assumption is critical for modeling\ntrue value creation. The primary goal is\nto use the model output to compare the\nbuyback against all alternatives,\nquantify stakeholder impacts, and assess\nvalue creation versus value transfer.\nSo now moving into the represent stage.\nThe analytical plan uses a simple Python\nclass capital allocator\nas you can see here\nto represent the company's financials\nand automate scenario analysis adhering\nto the required technical\nimplementation.\nAnd then going on to stage three\nwhich is implement. We begin the code\nexecution. The class initialization\nlines 10 through 23 sets the base case\nparameters\nwhich are derived directly from the\nassignment's capital allocation\nsnapshot.\nThe next lines calculate the derived\nbase metrics, notably the implied net\nincome of 95.34\nbillion, crucial for calculating initial\nEPS and ROIC.\nAnd then going down from that into the\ncalculate metric section,\nthe core calculation\nengine is this section.\nIt accepts four inputs. Net income\nchange, debt change, cash change and\nshares change.\nIt shows the calculation of new EPS\nwhich is new NI divided by new shares.\nThe new D / E ratio\nwhich is new debt divided by new market\ncap and the new ROIC.\nThis function automates the required EPS\nand leverage calculations.\nAnd then here we have the run scenarios\nmethod which executes the assignments\nrequired comparisons\nand today I'm going to be going over\nsection\nwe go to buy back shares.\nThe function is called with a negative\nshares change\nhere.\nQuantifying the ownership change and\nresulting EPS bump. Net income change is\nzero.\nThe debt reduction scenario models a\nfinancing change. The key line\ncalculates interest savings\nas you can see here\nwhich is 90 billion * 4% * 1 -25.\nThe function is called with a positive\nnet income change or interest savings\nand a negative debt change of minus90\nbillion quantifying the EPS and leverage\nshift\nand the acquisition\nR&D scenarios model strategic\ninvestments.\nThey hold shares and debt constant but\nincrease net income based on the assumed\nROIC 10% or 5%. This directly models the\nrequired strategic fit and value\ncreation aspect.\nThen moving on to validate, we interpret\nthe quantitative outputs. The buyback\nyields an EPS of 6.35\ndollars, a 3.22%\nincrease. The acquisition, if\nsuccessful, offers the highest EPS at\n$643,\na 9.49%\nincrease. Debt reduction drastically\nlowers the D over E ratio from 0.38 to\n0.03.\nThe model accurately calculates and\nsupports the scenario toggles required\nby the assignment. The model output is\nused to evaluate this distinction\nbetween value creation and value\ntransfer. The buyback is value transfer\nbecause net income is constant. The EPS\ngain comes solely from share account\nreduction. The acquisition over R&D\nalternatives are the only options that\nachieve true value creation by\nincreasing net income in ROIC\nfor management or employees. The\nbuyback's immediate EPS bump directly\nbenefits management and employee\noptions. This creates an agency\nconflict. Management may favor the\nbuyback over riskier long-term R&D for\nshort-term compensation gains. For bond\nholders, they prefer the financial\nderisking of debt reduction, which\nimproves their credit safety. The\nbuyback negatively impacts them by\nreducing the cash buffer and slightly\nincreasing leverage. For stage five,\nwhich is evolve, the analysis considered\nthe signaling effects and capital\ndiscipline. A buyback signals\nundervaluation which is debatable for a\nP over E of 30. Strategic R and D\nsignals a superior long-term commitment.\nNow for reflect. The quantitative data\nsuggests that relying solely on the\nbuyback for a 3.22% EPS gain sacrifices\nstrategic growth and financial\ndiscipline. The final recommendation is\na hybrid strategy of $45 billion\nincremental R&D and $45 billion debt\nreduction. This hybrid approach delivers\na superior risk adjusted outcome.\nOne superior EPS and value creation.\nThis strategy approaches\nor provides an EPS increase of\napproximately 3.9%.\nThis gain is achieved through\nfundamental earnings and interest\nsavings making it true value creation\nnot just transfer\nand two leverage optimization. The $45\nbillion\ndebt reduction maintain stringent\ncapital discipline keeping the D over E\nratio low and appealing to bond holders.\nNumber three strategic fit. The $45\nbillion R&D investment addresses the\ncritical need for long-term innovation\nin AI and VR, balancing the immediate\nfinancial concerns with future financial\ngrowth. The hybrid strategy best\nbalances stakeholder incentives and\naddresses the agency critique of the\nbuyback, ensuring both financial\nprudence and a commitment to sustained\nlong-term growth.\nThis concludes the analysis which used\nthe Python model as the required\nanalytical tool to evaluate the\ncorporate financial decision across all\ndriver stages.\nThank you.section."
