  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies and discusses all primary stakeholder groups—shareholders, management (CEO), and creditors/lenders—and briefly notes employees via option strikes. They also provide scenario-based reflections on impacts (ownership concentration, creditor risk), meeting completeness at an introductory level. The DRIVER stages show intent, implementation, and reflection aligned to stakeholder coverage.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly implemented a Python/Colab model and referenced the created code, reported numeric scenario results, and performed qualitative sanity checks (EPS up when shares fall, leverage rises with debt). This demonstrates executed code and validation at an introductory, conceptually thorough level, meeting the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated cross-scenario comparisons by coding scenarios for buyback, dividend, acquisition, and debt reduction, computing EPS/price/leverage automatically and summarizing with a scoring system. They exposed reusable inputs (proposal size, financing) and emphasized parameter changes to re-run scenarios, implying no manual copy-paste. This meets the criterion thoroughly within the DRIVER Implement/Evolve stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies that higher debt/leverage increases financial risk and repeatedly emphasizes risk reduction via debt reduction. However, they never mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate standard, this shows correct but incomplete treatment of the trade-off, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies some winners/losers (e.g., large holders/CEO vs selling shareholders; creditors preferring de-risking versus equity’s option value) and notes value transfer and leverage-related risk. However, treatment is surface-level: limited discussion of bondholder losses under buybacks, little on employees with options, and only an implicit, not detailed, explanation of asset substitution/risk-shifting. This demonstrates basic but incomplete conceptual coverage, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct, conceptual link between financing, leverage, EPS, and risk, and recognizes that debt reduction lowers financial risk. However, the treatment is basic: it lacks depth on how leverage amplifies both returns and losses and does not discuss fixed interest obligations or default risk. Thus, it meets a basic understanding but not the thoroughness required for a PASS.",
