  "transcript": "1\n00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,120\nHello, my name is Brock and for our\n\n2\n00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,480\nsession 11 uh assignment, we're going to\n\n3\n00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,200\nbe talking about the corporate financial\n\n4\n00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,800\ndecision analysis. So for the assignment\n\n5\n00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200\noverview, we are going to be evaluating\n\n6\n00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,680\nApple's hypothetical $90 billion share\n\n7\n00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,039\nrepurchase using the driver and then\n\n8\n00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,439\nwe're going to act as an independent\n\n9\n00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039\nanalysis or analyst who must determine\n\n10\n00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,600\nwhether the buyback creates value\n\n11\n00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\n\n12\n00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,199\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives\n\n13\n00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,360\nas well. So the allocation snapshot is\n\n14\n00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920\ngoing to look like we have liquid the\n\n15\n00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,320\nliquidity is $165 billion cash on\n\n16\n00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800\ninvestments and then hundred billion\n\n17\n00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,760\nannual free cash flow. The market\n\n18\n00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,200\ncontext is 185 share price uh with a\n\n19\n00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,559\ndividend yield of.5% and a 15.5 billion\n\n20\n00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,600\nshares outstanding. The balance sheet of\n\n21\n00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,480\n110 billion Birkshshire owns 6% CEO\n\n22\n00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,719\nholds $3 million shares. Retail in\n\n23\n00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,879\ninvestors average 10,000 shares.\n\n24\n00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,479\nEmployee has $170 strike options\n\n25\n00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280\nand the proposal is going to be a $90\n\n26\n00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,400\nbillion buyback executed over one year\n\n27\n00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479\nwhich is around 10% of the market cap\n\n28\n00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720\nand the alternatives uh besides the\n\n29\n00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,520\nbuyback are going to be a six $6 special\n\n30\n00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,880\ndividend, a strategic AIVR acquisition,\n\n31\n00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,640\ndebt reduction and incremental R&D. So\n\n32\n00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240\nwe're going to deliver a recommendation\n\n33\n00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360\nwhether that's the proposal or an\n\n34\n00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680\nalternative that explains the\n\n35\n00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439\nstakeholder this sorry stakeholder\n\n36\n00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,439\nimpacts agency considerations and value\n\n37\n00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119\ncreation versus value transfer outcomes.\n\n38\n00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920\nSo let's first get into the discover and\n\n39\n00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,720\ndesign tab. So what has given I just\n\n40\n00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040\nread it over Apple has all of this with\n\n41\n00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960\nthe proposal and the alternatives and\n\n42\n00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880\nthe context of this is we need to decide\n\n43\n00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,320\nthe buyback creates value or just\n\n44\n00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,439\nshifts. So, we're going to decide if\n\n45\n00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240\nit's if the buyback the\n\n46\n00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,000\n$90 billion buyback creates value or if\n\n47\n00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,320\nit just shifts value around. So, no\n\n48\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,520\nvalue is created from that. So, the\n\n49\n00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,360\ngoals are going to be to um compare\n\n50\n00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,079\nearnings per share, share price,\n\n51\n00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520\nleverage, ownership changes,\n\n52\n00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119\nand we're going to see how each option\n\n53\n00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560\naffects different stakeholders and\n\n54\n00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480\ndecide which option creates the most\n\n55\n00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,800\nlong run value. So, um my first is the\n\n56\n00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,040\nterms list. So we got the EPS is\n\n57\n00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760\nearnings per share. Leverage is going to\n\n58\n00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,360\nequal debt divided by equity. Buyback is\n\n59\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360\ngoing to be fewer shares. Value creation\n\n60\n00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720\nis going to be the grow total value. And\n\n61\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760\nthen the value transfer is going to be\n\n62\n00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,120\nshift value between groups. And the code\n\n63\n00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,200\nthat um I'll be creating through chat\n\n64\n00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560\nGPT. You'll see in a second, but uh it's\n\n65\n00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319\ngoing to show Apple's numbers, show the\n\n66\n00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400\nbuyback math, compare all options,\n\n67\n00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,280\nexplain who wins/ loses, and then the\n\n68\n00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280\nrecommend the best option.\n\n69\n00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,040\nSo for R represent what needs to be\n\n70\n00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800\nfound the new the things that need to be\n\n71\n00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280\nfound is the new earnings per share the\n\n72\n00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000\nnew share price new leverage stakeholder\n\n73\n00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,840\noutcomes ownership concentration risk\n\n74\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400\ncredit risk changes and value creation\n\n75\n00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,800\nversus value transfer and then what\n\n76\n00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440\nformulas we're going to be use is going\n\n77\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,680\nto be the earnings per share formula the\n\n78\n00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,959\nshares we purchased share price leverage\n\n79\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,360\nand then the ownership percent\n\n80\n00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200\nand the the variables are going to be\n\n81\n00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,200\nshares, US ownership, net income is\n\n82\n00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,519\nprofit, debt is risk, equities, company\n\n83\n00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800\nvalue.\n\n84\n00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920\nSo for implement how we're going to\n\n85\n00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720\nimplement this, we're going to be using\n\n86\n00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,319\na Python code in uh collab and then\n\n87\n00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,239\nwe're going to uh it's going to input\n\n88\n00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,239\nthe Apple's numbers and for each\n\n89\n00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319\nscenario and it's going to let the model\n\n90\n00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,040\ncalculate um earnings per share, price,\n\n91\n00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,040\nand leverage automatically.\n\n92\n00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640\nSo this is the code I created. So I said\n\n93\n00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040\ncreate m code using collab using the\n\n94\n00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,760\ndata based on this and I plugged in the\n\n95\n00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840\ncapital allocation snapshot as well as\n\n96\n00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,000\nthe recommendation at the very end that\n\n97\n00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519\nexplains stakeholder impacts and I said\n\n98\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200\nmake it easy to understand each part\n\n99\n00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,360\nlaid out correct headings description of\n\n100\n00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,280\nwhat it does with the keep it simple\n\n101\n00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720\nsuma method and at the end of the code\n\n102\n00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400\ncreate a recommendation that explains\n\n103\n00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000\nstakeholder impacts agency\n\n104\n00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560\nconsiderations and value creation versus\n\n105\n00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599\nvalue transfer outcomes.\n\n106\n00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920\nSo what that created\n\n107\n00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,120\nwas this code right here. So it's the\n\n108\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,720\nApple buyback driver model and we're\n\n109\n00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560\ngoing to start with uh this and the goal\n\n110\n00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720\nis to evaluate a hypothetical $90\n\n111\n00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,120\nbillion buyback\n\n112\n00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,400\nand it's going to be one period model.\n\n113\n00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,919\nSo we have the base inputs right here.\n\n114\n00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600\nThis is you can change these if you want\n\n115\n00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680\nbut it's already it's already set in\n\n116\n00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520\nstone for what Apple has. The\n\n117\n00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880\nstakeholder related simple inputs right\n\n118\n00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160\nhere.\n\n119\n00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,400\nthe proposal size and alternative uses,\n\n120\n00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,400\nthe buyback financing, cash versus new\n\n121\n00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840\ndebt,\n\n122\n00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,040\nand then this is going to compute the\n\n123\n00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,479\nbase net income, um, earnings price,\n\n124\n00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,520\nearnings per share, and then leverage\n\n125\n00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,520\nright here. That's going to create that.\n\n126\n00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360\nSo, we're going to start with the base\n\n127\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,680\nvalues here and track cash, new depth\n\n128\n00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,759\nuse,\n\n129\n00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960\nand this is the buyback scenario. This\n\n130\n00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880\nis the main scenario we're going to be\n\n131\n00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400\ntalking about\n\n132\n00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880\nand the shares you purchase at the\n\n133\n00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,199\ncurrent price and then the special\n\n134\n00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,639\ndividend scenario. And these are all of\n\n135\n00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,960\nthe scenarios used and all of their um\n\n136\n00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199\nformulas for them.\n\n137\n00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,919\nKeep scrolling down here. All the\n\n138\n00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,479\nscenarios are running\n\n139\n00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759\nand this is what our this is all the\n\n140\n00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,039\nending part. This is what it's going to\n\n141\n00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,479\ngive us. So,\n\n142\n00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,160\nlet me scroll up here. Sorry. All\n\n143\n00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,000\nright. So, the base metrics before any\n\n144\n00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,240\naction. This is the market cap. Oh,\n\n145\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520\nshoot. The net income, the EPS, the\n\n146\n00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360\nequity, and the leverage. I don't know\n\n147\n00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840\nhow I did that. There we go. And then\n\n148\n00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,120\nthe scenario results. So, the buyback\n\n149\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,680\nhas an EPS after of 6.36.\n\n150\n00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,560\nSo, it looks like the EPS is better from\n\n151\n00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,440\nthe base value. So, that's very good.\n\n152\n00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,400\nUm\n\n153\n00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,880\nthere is less on the special dividend\n\n154\n00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,199\nand a little more on the debt reduction\n\n155\n00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,560\nand the share price after it's going to\n\n156\n00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,160\nbe high here, high here and pretty high\n\n157\n00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,240\nhere. We got the uh leverage to equity.\n\n158\n00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,080\nIt looks like this one's going to be the\n\n159\n00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,199\nlowest and this one's going to be the\n\n160\n00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,440\nhighest. Park share ownership after we\n\n161\n00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,240\ngot these are all 006. This one's 00619\n\n162\n00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,520\nand CR ownership after.\n\n163\n00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,520\nSo they're all around the same.\n\n164\n00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240\nSo the simple recommendation summary is\n\n165\n00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520\nthe base EPS is going to be 6.17. This\n\n166\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,520\nis the base values and it's going to be\n\n167\n00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,880\na higher it's going to be like a score\n\n168\n00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,919\nsystem which is uh the better earnings\n\n169\n00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,600\nper share with the leverage tradeoff. So\n\n170\n00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,880\nfor debt reduction, it's going to be\n\n171\n00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,919\n1.3% change with a leverage of 0.02x\n\n172\n00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,160\nwith a score of 8.5. The AIVR\n\n173\n00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,720\nacquisition has an EPS change of 5.0\n\n174\n00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,160\nwith a leverage of 0.04 with a score of\n\n175\n00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,080\n5.9. So this one has a higher EPS change\n\n176\n00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240\nbut in a higher leverage. The scores\n\n177\n00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,319\nwill be lower. We have an incremental\n\n178\n00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,440\nR&D. The EPS change is four and the\n\n179\n00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,400\nleverage is going to be four on that\n\n180\n00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,720\nwhich is a 4.7.\n\n181\n00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,000\nWe got the buyback. Um this is the base\n\n182\n00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,599\none. The buyback is uh earnings per\n\n183\n00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800\nshare change is 3.2 and the leverage is\n\n184\n00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,000\n0.04 with a score of 3.2 and the special\n\n185\n00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,599\n$6 dividend with an uh earnings per\n\n186\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840\nshare change of zero and a leverage of\n\n187\n00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599\n004.\n\n188\n00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,400\nSo the scenario by scenario for the\n\n189\n00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,639\nstockholder view. So for the buyback for\n\n190\n00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,440\nthe stock the shareholders the average\n\n191\n00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,360\num price share moves by about 3.2 two\n\n192\n00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,039\nwithin the leverage ratio ownership\n\n193\n00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,639\nconcentration rises for Birkshshire and\n\n194\n00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,560\nthe CEO because the share count shrinks\n\n195\n00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039\nand long-term holders benefit if stock\n\n196\n00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,680\nis fairly priced or cheap but most of\n\n197\n00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:04,560\nthe effect is uh res distributing value\n\n198\n00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,680\nfrom uh selling shareholds let's say\n\n199\n00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,800\num the special is they get immediate\n\n200\n00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,639\ncash aiv is um earnings rise by about\n\n201\n00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000\nwith no extra leverage. If the acquired\n\n202\n00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599\nbusiness earns more on Apple's cost\n\n203\n00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759\ncapital, this is closer to real value\n\n204\n00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,720\ncreation.\n\n205\n00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,199\nThe debt reduction one, um this improves\n\n206\n00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840\nbalance sheet safely. Creditors like the\n\n207\n00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240\nlower risk um and equity holders give\n\n208\n00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039\nout some of the optional side. And then\n\n209\n00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200\nwe got the R&D, the budget dips about\n\n210\n00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,599\nthat. And then the overall\n\n211\n00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,760\nrecommendation for all of this is the\n\n212\n00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440\nmodel points to debt reduction as the\n\n213\n00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,240\nbest compromise because it has a\n\n214\n00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640\nmoderate um earnings per share uplift, a\n\n215\n00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,920\nlower financial risk and a support for\n\n216\n00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,160\nboth equity holders and creditors\n\n217\n00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000\nwith compared to that a full 90 uh\n\n218\n00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000\nbillion buyback looks very aggressive\n\n219\n00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920\nand risky. It sends a lot of the cash\n\n220\n00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600\nout the door and concentrates ownership\n\n221\n00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,360\nwithout clearly expanding the firm's\n\n222\n00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600\nopportunity.\n\n223\n00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519\nAnd the final judgment is to treat a $90\n\n224\n00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440\nbillion buyback as a supplement, not a\n\n225\n00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880\nsubstitute for a high return growth\n\n226\n00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800\ninvestment and a solid balance sheet\n\n227\n00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320\nthat keeps management from focus on real\n\n228\n00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800\nvalue creation instead of just the\n\n229\n00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,800\nearnings per share.\n\n230\n00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,959\nSo do these results make sense? Um yes,\n\n231\n00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,760\nearnings per share should increase when\n\n232\n00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,680\nshares fall. The leverage should rise if\n\n233\n00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839\ndebt rises and dividend should reduce\n\n234\n00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,399\nprice.\n\n235\n00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,560\nUm and then evolve. How can we improve\n\n236\n00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320\nthis? We can try different um Apple\n\n237\n00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,040\nvalues. We could try different buyback\n\n238\n00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,279\nsizes, different ratios. Um\n\n239\n00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,200\nand then what did we learn? Uh buyback\n\n240\n00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120\nboosts the earnings per share and\n\n241\n00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,760\nownership concentration, but it doesn't\n\n242\n00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680\nguarantee like a true value creation.\n\n243\n00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600\nDividends, return cash, we don't grow\n\n244\n00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,040\nthe company, debt reductions, lowers\n\n245\n00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,160\nrisks, and um\n\n246\n00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839\nhow's everything tied together? The\n\n247\n00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480\nmodel shows each of the choice affects\n\n248\n00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,959\nEPS risk and stake differently.\n\n249\n00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,959\nAnd um yeah, that's pretty much it. So\n\n250\n00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,080\nour final uh recommendation is that debt\n\n251\n00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,959\nreduction is going to be the best\n\n252\n00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,040\ncompromise with a average of pretty much\n\n253\n00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,480\nall of these. And if you want to use any\n\n254\n00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,800\nother ones, they're a lot aggressive and\n\n255\n00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,800\nriskier. So thank you so much"
