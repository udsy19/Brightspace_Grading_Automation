  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Arian and today I'm going\n0:03\nto go over the assignment um for session\n0:06\n11.\n0:08\nSo, I'll start off with going over the\n0:10\nassignment and then yeah, so we're\n0:12\nbasically saying we're that we're a\n0:14\nhypothetical analyst with helping\n0:17\nevaluate Apple's $90 billion share\n0:19\npurchase and we want to use Driver to do\n0:20\nso. We're given all this information\n0:22\nwhich we'll go over after. We want to\n0:24\ndeliver a recommendation that explains\n0:26\nshareholder impacts, agency\n0:27\nconsiderations and value creation versus\n0:29\nvalue transfer outcomes. So I have all\n0:32\nthe information over here. Let's get\n0:33\nstarted. So we want to see\n0:38\num best use capital given alternatives\n0:39\nof $6 special dividends, strategic AIR\n0:42\nacquisition, debt reduction, and R&D\n0:43\ninvestment. We're going to analyze this\n0:45\nthrough using earnings per share,\n0:46\nownership concentration, leverage, uh\n0:48\nagency and governance considerations,\n0:50\nstakeholder incentives, signaling and\n0:52\nlong-term capital allocation,\n0:53\ndiscipline. Um, and we're giving all\n0:56\nthis information, which is about $165\n0:58\nbillion worth of cash investments, $100\n1:00\nbillion worth of annual free cash flow,\n1:02\nuh, $185 per share with a PE multiple of\n1:05\n30, a dividend yield of 0.5% shares\n1:08\noutstanding of 15.5 billion, uh, $110\n1:11\nbillion of debt, 6% shares in Berkshire\n1:13\nHathway, uh, or from Berkshire Hathway.\n1:16\nCEO has 3 million shares, Tim Cook, um,\n1:18\n100 shares for retail investors, and\n1:20\nemployees have options of $170 worth of\n1:22\nstrike. Uh the size is 90 billion over\n1:24\none year with a buyback yield of $90\n1:25\nbillion for the market cap divided by\n1:27\nmarket cap and we're financing it from\n1:29\nexisting cash and pre-cash. We're not\n1:30\nassuming new debt and adding to this um\n1:32\npre-existing $110 billion worth of debt.\n1:34\nAnd then we have the special cases of\n1:36\ndividends, AIVR acquisition, debt\n1:37\nreduction and incremental R&D. Uh we\n1:40\nwant to build a model to quantify the\n1:42\nearnings per share impact, account\n1:43\nchanges, ownership concentration shifts.\n1:45\nAnd then we're going to calculate some\n1:46\nsimple leverage metrics like debt equity\n1:48\nand then debt divided by debt plus\n1:49\nequity. We'll compare the buyback bank\n1:51\nversus alternative uses cash and we'll\n1:53\nsee the ownership um in retail investors\n1:56\ninstitutional management employees of\n1:58\nstock options and bond holders and we'll\n1:59\ndeliver our recommendation plan. So\n2:01\nwe'll first represent so from our PE and\n2:04\nprice our earnings per share is about\n2:05\n$6.17.\n2:06\nUh net income using this formula is\n2:08\n$95.6 billion and our market cap is\n2:11\nabout 2.87 trillion. um just calculating\n2:15\nusing the share price times the free\n2:16\nshares floating and then our equity\n2:18\nvalues uh market cap and then our\n2:20\nleverage ratios are given as below in\n2:22\nthe equation. So now we're going to\n2:25\nillustrate the buyback which is that\n2:26\nwe're going to repurchase about 1859B\n2:30\nuh shares or yeah 185 shares times the\n2:34\num oh 90 billion divided by 185 shares\n2:37\nsorry our new share count is going to be\n2:38\njust the shares minus the shares we\n2:40\npurchased and if our net income is\n2:41\nunchanged which is what our assumption\n2:42\nis uh we're just going to have um the\n2:46\nfollowing value and then if the PE\n2:47\nmultiple remains constant then our\n2:49\nearnings per share will also change in a\n2:50\nvery minimal amount. Our equity value\n2:53\nwill drop by $90 billion because that's\n2:54\nwhat we're returning in cash and our\n2:55\ndebt will be unchanged. Our new market\n2:57\ncap or new equity market value just be\n2:59\n90 billions attracted by the market cap\n3:01\nand we're going to update our leverage\n3:02\nratios to reflect that. Now looking at\n3:04\nthe stakeholder specific metrics uh\n3:06\nBurkshire Hathaway 6% will become or is\n3:09\n93 billion uh shares and it will be a\n3:12\nslight percent higher than that just\n3:14\ngiven the fact that they won't um they\n3:18\nwon't sell into that buyback which is a\n3:19\ntypical thing that hedge funds don't or\n3:21\nmanage massive conglomerates the CEO\n3:24\nwill see a similar increase in ownership\n3:25\nas brokers does their equity value just\n3:27\nbe the share times the new price retail\n3:29\ninvestors have about 100 shares they'll\n3:31\nget higher EPS and higher ownership\n3:32\npercentage per share and If they do\n3:33\nsell, they get liquidity preferences,\n3:35\nbut they'll miss any accretion or stock\n3:37\num generation in the future. Uh the\n3:39\nemployees with options in 170. So\n3:42\ncurrently the intrinsic value of the\n3:43\noption is just 185US 170, which is $15.\n3:45\nAnd they're in the money right now. Um\n3:47\nand if price rises, they'll be in the\n3:49\nmoney and their intrinsic value of\n3:50\noptions increases. And there's a few\n3:52\ndetails that um have not been given, but\n3:54\nwe can kind of assume. And the buyback\n3:56\nwill tend to enhance their option value.\n3:58\nIf this multiple does hold, uh bond\n4:00\nholders will see no immediate coupon\n4:02\npayments. they will have a slight\n4:03\nincrease in credit risk because there's\n4:04\nless cash on hand and there's a higher\n4:06\nnet leverage in assets. So, they'll get\n4:08\nno benefit. Maybe even tiny downside in\n4:10\nterms of margin. And I'm also assuming\n4:12\nthat the market for Apple's bonds won't\n4:13\nbe too popular after they pay out like a\n4:15\n$90 billion um a $90 billion uh buyback.\n4:21\nSo, uh their market for uh the liquidity\n4:25\nfor that bond market might go down as\n4:26\nwell. So, the special dividend $6 a\n4:28\nshare, we're going to spend $93 billion.\n4:30\nUm, our APS won't be affected in the\n4:32\nshort term. Your share price will\n4:33\nbasically drop $6 because that's what\n4:34\nyou're selling out and the ownership\n4:36\npercentages are unchanged. Uh, the debt,\n4:38\nif you to choose a debt reduction path,\n4:40\nit'll go down to 20 billion with a\n4:41\nstronger balance sheet, improve credit\n4:43\nrating, and lower interest expense. And\n4:45\nyou increase financial flexibility and\n4:46\nreduce cost of capital. If you were to\n4:49\num acquire companies or do R&D, you\n4:51\nwould have to use the ROIC rate on these\n4:53\ninvestments versus shareholder yield and\n4:54\nthe buyback. If it's greater than your\n4:56\nwhack or your cost of capital, then it\n4:57\ncreates new value and it reduces it\n5:00\ngenerally returns excess capital and\n5:01\ngrowth opportunities are limited. So\n5:03\nthat's something that Apple's heads\n5:04\nreally have to consider, which is that\n5:06\nif we have growth opportunities, then it\n5:07\nmight be better to devote that 90\n5:09\nbillion to that versus um this. But\n5:11\nwe're going to use an industry standard\n5:13\nlike an average of what we consider like\n5:14\nan ROIC to compare to the cost of\n5:16\ncapital of uh Apple. So we're going to\n5:18\nuse Python to implement the model. So\n5:20\nwe're going to first parameterize a\n5:22\nbaseline, compute the baseline, and then\n5:24\nmodel all the scenarios we discussed. So\n5:25\nbuyback, special dividends, debt\n5:27\nreductions, and then acquisition, and\n5:28\nR&D. And then we'll all visualize it in\n5:30\nthe end using some Python libraries. And\n5:32\nthen we'll toggle the scenarios and kind\n5:33\nof explain the outputs. Before we run\n5:35\nthe model, I'll describe the criteria\n5:36\nthat we've developed to check and\n5:38\nperform if it's working well. So does\n5:40\nshares we purchased equal to the 90\n5:41\nbillion divided by 185? Does the new\n5:43\nshare count make sense? Does the EPS\n5:44\nhigher after the buyback? Do broker and\n5:46\nCEO ownership percentages increase? Does\n5:48\nthe DHB rise modestly in cash or\n5:51\nbuybacks instead of held? Does a special\n5:52\ndividend leave EPS unchanged? And then\n5:54\nis the debt to value ratio materially\n5:56\nlower when using the debt reduction\n5:57\nscenario.\n5:59\nSo over here we have the uh code that I\n6:01\nran. So we're using these libraries. So\n6:02\nwe're going to just set our baseline\n6:03\nparameters and metrics as we discussed\n6:05\nabove. Um and then we'll first do our\n6:07\nbuyback scenario where we're just\n6:08\ncalculating the total dollar spent on\n6:10\nbuybacks and adding some backend in case\n6:13\nthere's extra debt. uh and then we'll\n6:15\nsee how it affects each new holder\n6:16\ndepending on the scenarios we discussed\n6:18\nabove. Now for the special dividend is\n6:19\npretty simple. We're just going to\n6:20\nsubtract the price drop and then add the\n6:22\namount of money to the retail holder.\n6:25\nFor debt reduction, we're going to use\n6:26\ncash to pay down debt. It's a very\n6:28\nsimple um calculation there. And for the\n6:32\nacquisition R&D, I think is the hardest\n6:33\nmodeling that we had to do because of\n6:36\nthese two numbers over here, which is\n6:37\nthat we had to basically model\n6:39\nacquisition um ROC for R&D and\n6:41\nacquisition. Um, and these are numbers\n6:43\nthat like we don't have and we don't\n6:44\nknow because they're such like\n6:46\nwidespread like the acquisition\n6:47\npercentage that McDonald's would have\n6:49\nversus Apple is so different or like\n6:51\nsome company like SpaceX, right? So, we\n6:55\nassume 11% and 13% depending on R&D or\n6:57\nacquisitions and we'll just kind of take\n6:59\nthis with like a grain of salt, but this\n7:01\nis what we estimated as like an industry\n7:03\nstandard um in the way that Apple\n7:04\noperates and compared to that massive $3\n7:06\ntrillion market cap, how would it affect\n7:08\nuh it? And then we're just going to\n7:10\nvisualize this by using these plot\n7:12\nfunctions and libraries to just make\n7:13\nlike a nice plot. So as you see, our\n7:15\nmarket cap is about 2.867 trillion.\n7:17\nEarnings per share is $6.17. Net\n7:19\nincome's 95 billion. Our debt to\n7:21\nvaluation was 3.69%. Berkshire owns\n7:24\nabout 6%. CEO owns about 0194%.\n7:27\nUh the retail value is about $18,500 per\n7:30\nretail investor and the intrinsic value\n7:32\nper employee option is about $15 right\n7:34\nnow. That's the baseline. Given the\n7:37\nbuyback, we'll repurchase about half a\n7:38\nbillion dollars worth of the shares.\n7:39\nWe'll have about $15 billion shares\n7:41\noutstanding. The price after the buyback\n7:43\nis about $6.37, like the 20 cent\n7:45\nincrease. Um, our PE will be the same,\n7:47\n190.99, or the price, sorry, with the\n7:49\nsame PE. Our new market cap will be the\n7:51\nexact same, 2867.5.\n7:54\nUm, the debt to value will be the same\n7:55\nbecause it doesn't change. The\n7:56\nBirkshire's ownership will go up by 0.2.\n7:58\nSame with the CEO's ownership. Sorry,\n8:01\n02.2.\n8:03\nUm and then uh the retail holders value\n8:05\nwill be about $90,000 is up like $500\n8:07\nunrealized and employees options will go\n8:10\nup $299 per options contractor per share\n8:13\nowned.\n8:15\nGiven the $6 dividend, um all that's\n8:16\ngoing to happen is that we're going to\n8:17\nspend $93 billion and approximately the\n8:20\nstock will drop to 179. We'll reduce the\n8:22\nmarket cap to this value and each retail\n8:24\nholder or any holder will receive $600\n8:26\nin cash. And finally, if we reduce the\n8:28\nscenario by debt, it'll just be $20\n8:30\nbillion of debt and our debt to equity\n8:32\nratio will fall a lot about 69%. And\n8:34\nthen you can see these are the numbers\n8:35\nwe modeled for the AIVR acquisition and\n8:37\nthe incremental R&D. So our ROIC is 11\n8:40\nand 13% respectively. Our whack is 8%\n8:42\nfor apples that we modeled as like a\n8:44\ncost of capital. And so the spread is\n8:46\nabout $33 billion for AIVR acquisitions\n8:49\nand 56 billion for incremental R&D. This\n8:52\nis the models we designed to kind of\n8:53\ndocument this. So our earnings per share\n8:56\nis pretty constant among the three of a\n8:57\nbaseline buyback and debt reduction. But\n8:59\nfor um our debt to equity ratios or debt\n9:02\nto value just for debt reduction which\n9:04\nis kind of something that we've already\n9:05\nkind of outlined goes down tremendously.\n9:08\nSo shares you purchase yes we just going\n9:10\nto go over our valid validation\n9:12\nquestions. New future account makes\n9:13\nsense. Yes. EPS is higher. Uh ownership\n9:16\npercentage did increase. DV does\n9:18\nincrease. Special dividends does leave\n9:19\nit unchanged. And we can see that the\n9:21\ndebt valuation was materially lower. So\n9:23\nbefore I discuss like the\n9:24\nrecommendation, I'll discuss how I could\n9:26\nimprove the model which is that I could\n9:28\nmodel dynamic earnings. We could\n9:29\nincorporate the walk changes as like our\n9:31\ndebt to equity lever changes. We could\n9:33\nmodel different buyback prices for\n9:35\nstock. So maybe like higher lower than\n9:37\nthe current price. Uh we could really\n9:39\noutline the RSUs for the employees\n9:41\nbecause a lot of employees have a lot\n9:43\nmore complicated contracts and how they\n9:44\nhave to execute it like for example\n9:47\nvesting or hedging or some other\n9:49\ncontract they might have with Apple. And\n9:50\nthen also this is like a very best case\n9:53\nscenario very like comfortable\n9:54\nassumptions not factoring like\n9:56\nmacroeconomic factors economic factors\n9:58\nand other stuff that really would affect\n10:00\nthe business. So maybe that so overall\n10:03\nlike reflecting on this um retail\n10:06\nholders benefit from both buybacks and\n10:07\ndividends either they get cash or they\n10:09\nget higher ownership concentrations and\n10:10\npercentages. Institutional holders like\n10:12\nthe buybacks because their shares go up\n10:14\nand they get to hold them and their\n10:15\npercentage ownership also increases. uh\n10:17\nmanagement doesn't really care because\n10:19\nthey get compensated either way, but\n10:21\nthey really like the um buyback because\n10:24\ntheir competition goes up a lot since\n10:25\ntheir entire package is usually stock.\n10:27\nLike if you see it's like a dollar a\n10:28\nsalary and then like a million like tens\n10:30\nof millions of dollars in just stock. Um\n10:32\nbut the only problem is that in terms of\n10:34\nlike the governance that we talked\n10:35\nabout, um CEOs can just automatically\n10:38\nwant to do these buybacks for personal\n10:39\ngains or short-term metrics so they can\n10:40\nshow that they're doing good when\n10:41\nthey're not. Because if you think about\n10:43\nit, a $9 billion buyback is a lot for a\n10:46\ncompany and then you can use it to say,\n10:47\"Oh, our share prices went up, but you\n10:48\ndidn't really do anything to contribute\n10:50to that.\" And employees with options\n10:52\nobviously benefit um continually. And\n10:54\nthe bond holders really have no benefits\n10:56\nexcept if we do the debt reduction\n10:58\nbecause uh they probably get their money\n10:59\nback a lot safer safer and it's a lot\n11:02\nless risky. Now talking about the value\n11:04\ncreation versus value transfer. Our\n11:05\nvalue creation occurs if we're\n11:06\npurchasing shares below intrinsic value\n11:08\nand if our alternatives have lower ROI\n11:10\nthan the return implicit in the buyback.\n11:12\nAnd our value transfer occurs when these\n11:14\nremaining shareholders gain at the\n11:16\nexpense. Our equity holders have the\n11:18\nrisk of bond holders and then uh\n11:19\nmanagement optimizes for EPS rather than\n11:21\nlong-term returns. Um, buybacks can\n11:25\nsignal more than just like we have\n11:26\nmoney, but like a lot more like strong\n11:28\ngrowth opportunities, a lot more cash\n11:30\ngeneration, like a lot more business\n11:31\ncredibility, but you lose that free cash\n11:34\non hand to like let's say buy a company\n11:36\nthat suddenly comes up for sale. Um, and\n11:38\nyou kind of miss out on that. So, you\n11:40\nreally want to find like a good mix for\n11:42\nit. You have to guard that a lot against\n11:43\nshort-term EPS engineering for personal\n11:45\nbenefit from like uh the top holders of\n11:48\nthe company. And then you also have to\n11:49\nshow a lot of transparency. So I'll go\n11:51\nover my like recommendation template\n11:52\nthat I made on what I recommend. So\n11:54\nsaying that our model suggests that a\n11:55\n$90 billion buyback hit 185 per share\n11:57\nwould reduce the share count from 15.5\n11:58\nbillion to approximately 50 billion\n12:00\nincreasing EPS by about 20 uh 20 cents\n12:02\nper share. Uh ownership percentages rise\n12:05\nmodestly while leverage increases\n12:06\nslightly compared to a $6 special\n12:08\ndividend that Russian hypothetical AIVR\n12:10\nacquisition. The buyback transfers value\n12:12\nto remaining shareholders and equity\n12:13\nlinked insiders with limited incremental\n12:16\nvalue creation unless the shares are\n12:17\ntrading below intrinsic value. Given\n12:19\nApple's strong balancing large FCF or\n12:21\nfree cash flow, I would conditionally\n12:22\nsupport the buyback and recommend\n12:24\nprioritizing a smaller flexible viable\n12:27\npro buyback program combined with like a\n12:29\nmix of R&D strategic acquisitions to\n12:31\nbalance your long-term innovation and\n12:32\ngrowth for the future with shareholder\n12:34\nreturns and kind of keeping your\n12:35\nshareholders and your company overall\n12:37\nhappy. So yeah, that's my presentation\n12:39\nand thank you."
