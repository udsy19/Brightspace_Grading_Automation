Using the driver framework, I will evaluate whether this proposal represents the best use of capital relative to alternatives like special dividends or strategic acquisitions. So we will begin the fund and discover phase. The context is critical here. Apple has over.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 23 seconds\nCapitalized with 165 billion in liquidity and 100 billion in annual free cash flow. The proposal is massive, 90 billion in buyback, representing roughly 10% of the market cap. Our core problem is distinguishing between value creation, actually improving the business fundamentals and value transfer.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 38 seconds\nTransfer simply, simple or simply financial engineering. We must also balance conflicting stakeholder interests from Berkeley Hathaway's preference for tax efficiency to retail investors who might prefer cash dividends.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 0 minutes 54 seconds\nSo as you can see here, everything on the Finance Discover stage is located here with the stakeholder map showcasing Berkshire Hathaway as 6% owner, CEO has three million shares, employees, option holders with buybacks and Riesel income investors.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 12 seconds\nThe core question, does a buyback create intrinsic value or is it just financial engineering? We will define value creation as an increase in ROIC for growth and value transfer as returning capital to shareholders.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 26 seconds\nSo.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 28 seconds\nNow for the represent. So moving to the represent phase, I have designed a Python based simulation to compare 4 distinct capital deployment paths. Instead of a static spreadsheet, I've architected a class based model called capital allocator. This logic. The logic is as follows. Inputs we feed in the live balance sheet, data, cash, debt, net income.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 1 minute 47 seconds\nShare count the engine. The model will process a 90 billion outflow through our four scenarios and the adjustments. Crucially, the model dynamically adjusts net income. If we spend cash, we lose interest in, lose interest in. If we pay debt, we save interest expense. This structure allows us to isolate the mechanical impact on EPS and leverage for.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 2 minutes 7 seconds\nEvery scenario.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 2 minutes 11 seconds\nSo the inputs are again what I said where the process the model simulate the four distinct scenarios, status quo, do nothing, buy back, repurchase, special dividend, distribute the 90 as a one time cash payment and reinvest R&D acquisition spend it on Uh assets assuming a target ROIC.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 1 second\nThe share count remains flat. The impact is purely on the balance sheet. Cash exits the building, reducing our interest income by shares outstanding staying the same.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 12 seconds\nWhich scenario D here now is in the acquisition scenario, I've modeled growth outcomes instead of just losing interest income. We assume this capital generates 10% ROIC and press buying a high growth AI.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 27 seconds\nAI firm, this adds to the net income lines. So you can see here in all these scenarios with the code showcasing what's going on, the new earnings and especially in the strategic acquisition here, new earnings equaling capital deployment and going down and showcasing that next for our last scenario.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 48 seconds\nUh, we consolidate these outputs into pandas.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 4 minutes 53 seconds\nOr for the last scenario, doing that reduction, showcasing the pay down debt and save interest. And then finally we consolidate these outputs into a pandas data frame for an apples to apples comparison with EPS leverage and share count.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 9 seconds\nSo now in the validating, so let's validate results. Looking at the output table, I can show you that down here with this lines of code doing completing the output and executing the analysis and visualizing the stakeholder analysis.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 28 seconds\nSo now for the actual output as you can see down here, so the status quo EPS is roughly 6.17 billion. The buyback EPS is jumps to 6.36.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 44 seconds\nBillion.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 5 minutes 47 seconds\nAnd this confirms the buyback is accretive. Accretive. It mechanically boosts earnings per share by reducing the denominator, and the special dividend actually lowers the EPS slightly to 6.05.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 3 seconds\nBecause we lost interest income on the cash without reducing the share count.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 9 seconds\nSo now with the visualization of the bar graph or the bar chart, this visualization makes the trade up clear to executive executives. The buyback. The buyback in green drives immediate EPS growth, while the dividend in red dilutes it. However, notice the acquisition bar in blue. If execution is perfect, it offers the highest upside.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 29 seconds\nSide but also carries the highest risk as you can see here.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 36 seconds\nSo now to go into the evolve stage, we must evolve our thinking beyond just the EPS number. This is where agency theory applies. So management incentives. Management is heavily incentivized to choose the buyback. Why? Because the CEO holds 3 million shares and likely has performance bonuses tied to EPS targets.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 6 minutes 55 seconds\nA buyback artificially hits those targets without requiring operational improvement. Now second value creation versus transfer. We must be honest, the buyback is value transfer. We are simply returning capital to exit exiting shareholders. It does not make Apple's.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 11 seconds\nProducts better. The acquisition scenario represents value creation, building new capabilities, but at a $90 billion scale. The integration risk is massive now for signaling by repurchasing shares at AP.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 27 seconds\nPE of 30 management is signaling strong confidence. They are effectively saying we believe our stock is the best investment we can make. This creates a floor price for the said stock.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 39 seconds\nNow the final reflection and recommendation. So looking over the code and what went on and looking at this 90 billion share repurchase through, I recommend approving the 90 billion share repurchase but with specific government governance.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 7 minutes 56 seconds\nConditions. While an acquisition offers theoretical growth, spending 90 billion on a single target is reckless. A special dividend is tax if inefficient for major tax inefficient for major holders like Berkshire Hathaway.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 12 seconds\nThe buyback is the optimal choice because the capital discipline. It returns excess cash rather than encouraging empire building. And for stakeholder alignment, it satisfies institutional investors and boosts the stock price for employees holding options.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 27 seconds\nNext steps. So however, to mitigate a agency risk.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 34 seconds\nSo to mitigate in agency risk, we identify the compensation committee must exclude the impact of this buyback from from the CEO's bonus calculations. This ensures leadership is rewarded for organic.\nSilas Cameron Bowman 8 minutes 49 secondsFor organic innovation, not just financial engineering. This concludes the analysis and the completion of the code. Thank you very much."
