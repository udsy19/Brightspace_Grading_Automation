  "transcript": "Hi. So today I'm going to be doing\n0:04\nsession 11 assignment for options and\n0:08\nderivative derivatives and I'll be going\n0:10\nover this assignment using the driver\n0:11\nframework. So first thing I'm going to\n0:13\ndo is going to I'm going to walk go over\n0:16\nthe assignment as stated in the\n0:20\ntextbook.\n0:22\nSo the scenario is you're a junior\n0:26\nyou're a junior derivatives analysis at\n0:28\nShield Capital Management. Your firm\n0:30\nmanages a 10 million equity portfol port\n0:33\nportfolio which is 100,000 shares of SP\n0:37\nSPY at 450.\n0:41\nAfter a 25%\n0:43\nrally this year, your portfolio manager\n0:46\nwants to implement an option strategy to\n0:49\nprotect gains while maintaining upside\n0:51\npotential.\n0:53\nDesign hedging strategy that design a\n0:56\nhedging strategy that balances\n0:58\nprotection cost while remaining upside.\n1:01\nSo that's our scenario. Now going over\n1:04\nhere, I'm going to walk us through the\n1:07\nassignment using driver.\n1:10\nSo first step is define and discover. So\n1:12\nI'm going to go over the good given\n1:14\nscenarios and context. So the portfolio\n1:17\nasset is $100,000 shares of SPY S&P 500\n1:22\nwhich is S&P of 500. The current SM spy\n1:26\nprice is $450. The total portfolio value\n1:30\nis 100,000 100,000 shares times 450. So\n1:34\nthat's $45\n1:36\nmillion.\n1:38\nThe prompt also a little note is that\n1:40\nthe prompts the prompt states that 10\n1:43\nmillion equity portfolio but the share\n1:46\ncount\n1:48\nbut the share count and price give 45\n1:51\nmillion. We will use the calculated 45\n1:54\nmillion for this problem. The market\n1:58\ncontext is 25% rally this year. The goal\n2:02\nis in implement implement implement an\n2:05\noption strategy to protect gains while\n2:07\nmaintaining upside potential. A\n2:10\nclassical goal for a protective strategy\n2:12\nafter a significant rally.\n2:15\nSo the financial objectives of this\n2:17\nvideo is to analyze three main hedging\n2:20\napproaches, protective puts, callers,\n2:22\nand spreads. Select the optimal strategy\n2:25\nbased on the protection versus cost\n2:27\nversus upside trade-off. Calculate and\n2:29\ninterpret the Greeks which is delta,\n2:31\ngamma, theta and new for chosen strategy\n2:35\nand conduct a scenario analysis\n2:39\nlike playoff diagram and P&L under\n2:41\ndifferent market movements all while\n2:44\nusing Python notebook to sort of execute\n2:47\nvisuals to show the results.\n2:51\nMoving on to represent. So the client's\n2:54\nprimary objective is to protect gains\n2:57\nwhile maintaining upside potential, but\n2:59\nalso to balance protect protection\n3:01\ncosts. So to do this, we're going to\n3:03\nkind of go over the three main hedging\n3:04\nthings that I kind of went over a little\n3:06\nbit in the define to discover. So first\n3:08\nis the protective put. This is the\n3:10\nsimplest and most robust from form of\n3:14\ninsurance. So\n3:17\nthe mechanics of this is you own the\n3:20\nassets long stock and buy put options\n3:22\nlong put protection for this is the\n3:25\nmaximum and abs is maximum and absolute\n3:27\nthe put strike price or KP sets the\n3:31\nfloor the lowest value your portfolio\n3:32\ncan drop at an expiration regardless of\n3:35\nhow far the market falls. Upsides of\n3:38\nthis is it's unlimited since you only\n3:40\nbought a put. you remain 100% of you\n3:43\nretain 100% of your stock appreciation\n3:46\npotential above the current price. The\n3:50\ncost and trade-offs, however, is it's\n3:52\nthe most expensive. You pay you're\n3:54\npaying the full premium for insurance,\n3:57\nnot debit. The cost erodess your profits\n4:00\nin in flat or slightly rising markets.\n4:04\nMoving on to collar. So this directly\n4:07\naddresses the high cost of the\n4:09\nprotective putt by focusing the\n4:12\ninvestors to sacrifice by forcing the\n4:15\ninvestors to sacrifice some upside\n4:18\npotential. So the mechanics of this one\n4:20\nis you own the asset buy a putt and sell\n4:24\na call which is a short call to pay for\n4:27\nthe putt. The protection on this is\n4:29\nexcellent but limited. The protection\n4:30\nruns from current price down to put\n4:33\nstrike which is KP. The upside of this\n4:36\nis is it's capped. By selling the call,\n4:38\nyou surrender any gains above the call\n4:40\nstrike price. The KC this this call\n4:45\nselling is what makes a it's is what\n4:48\nmakes it a caller. It creates a bounded\n4:51\nrange for the portfolio's final value.\n4:55\nThe cost and trade-offs of this is by\n4:57\nchoosing the strike carefully, you can\n5:00\ncreate a zerocost collar or even receive\n5:03\na smaller net credit.\n5:06\nAnd for the last one, a putt spread. Oh,\n5:09\nthis is a way to reduce cost the cost of\n5:12\na protective putt, but but at the\n5:14\nexpense of accepting some tail rests.\n5:18\nThe mechanics of this is you own the\n5:20\nasset, but buy a putt at a high stake. K\n5:24\nhigh for primary protection and sell the\n5:27\nput at a low strike K low for fi to\n5:29\nfinance the cost protection is limited\n5:32\nprotection is only guaranteed between K\n5:35\nhigh and K low\n5:37\nupside is it's unlimited unlike collard\n5:41\nyou do not sell a call so the stock's\n5:43\nappreciation is uncapped the cost and\n5:46\ntrades the the cost and tradeoff is it's\n5:49\ncheaper than the pro protective putt as\n5:52\nthe premium received from the short putt\n5:55\noffsets some of the long putts cost.\n5:57\nHowever, you are exposed to full losses\n6:00\nbelow K low minus the net premium\n6:02\nreceived.\n6:04\nSo, what I've concluded from our\n6:06\nrepresent stage is that the color\n6:08\nstrategy strategy is likely the most\n6:11\nsuitable as it directly addresses the\n6:13\nrequirement of balancing protective\n6:14\nprotection costs while maintaining some\n6:16\nupside even if it's capped.\n6:22\nSo what still needs to be solved is\n6:24\noption prices using model like black\n6:28\nskulls optimal putt floor and call cap\n6:32\nstrike prices K put K call in and\n6:34\nmaturity all need to still be solved the\n6:37\noverall costing credit of the caller and\n6:40\nthe resulting Greeks for the overall\n6:42\nstrategy K stock plus long put plus\n6:45\nshort short\n6:50\nSo now I'm going to move over to the in\n6:54\nimplement Google Collab.\n6:58\nI'm going to come to the top of my\n7:04\nPython code and I'm just going to kind\n7:06\nof go over some of the key numbers or\n7:08\nthings that you'll probably see. So\n7:11\nthese are the key financial perimeters.\n7:13\nYou can see the $450\n7:16\nuh for the current SPY price the 100,000\n7:20\nshares in the portfolio\n7:23\nand then the portfolio value you can see\n7:25\nthat they're multiplying that like we\n7:26\ndid in the represent stage to get the 45\n7:28\nmillion the rate is 3 the risk-free rate\n7:32\nis 3% the s for sigma it's 20 or sigma\n7:37\nor volat volatility it's 20% and time\n7:40\ntime to maturity is 25 years or 90 days\n7:46\n0 is 0.25 years or 90 days.\n7:53\nUm\n7:54\nhere they're solving for delta, gamma,\n7:57\ntheta and beta.\n8:03\nHere you can also see the $430 at 4.4%\n8:06\nprotection floor and 4.4 for upside cap\n8:12\nnet premium.\n8:16\nThey're calculating for the Greeks\n8:18\nagain. And coming all the way down here,\n8:23\nI'm going to go over our results. So the\n8:28\nfinancial setup model initialization. So\n8:30\nas we said, it's 45 million for the\n8:32\ninitial portfolio value. Hedging\n8:34\nparameters are 91 days, volatility is\n8:39\n20% and risk-free rate is 3%.\n8:44\nUm,\n8:46\nso for the collar structure,\n8:49\nyou can see that for long pro for the\n8:54\nlong protective put K430,\n8:58\nthe price is 8.27, 27 short financing\n9:00\ncall 1120 and the net premium for both\n9:04\nof these would then result in292,9558\n9:12\nin credit.\n9:15\nSo\n9:17\nnow we're going to go on to the greed.\n9:18\nSo for delta the value is $34,579.\n9:24\nSo this what we've interpreted from\n9:27\ndelta being this number is it reduces\n9:29\nexposure for a $1 rise in spy portfolio\n9:35\ngains $34,05787\n9:39\nwhile the original is $100,000.\n9:42\nNow for gamma the the value is95.5\n9:50\norgative95.5\n9:53\n342 what this means it's slightly\n9:55\nnegative meaning the delta becomes less\n9:57\nsensitive as spy moves away from\n10:02\nmoves away from the 450.\n10:05\nSo now for theta, the value is 3,474.91.\n10:11\nThis is positive, meaning the strategy\n10:13\nearns $3,474.91\n10:19\nper day\n10:21\num at a time at a time per day to\n10:26\ntime decay. For Vega, it's 9,672.84.\n10:33\nThis means the change in value of 1%\n10:35\nvolume change is ngative9,672.84\n10:44\ncents which is low volatility sensitive\n10:46\nsensitivity.\n10:48\nNow going on to this chart you can see\n10:51\nthat it kind of shows out here is the\n10:55\nprofit and loss in millions and here is\n10:56\nspy price expirations.\n11:00\nYou can see the cap the caps that are\n11:04\nput in at the max loss that you can get\n11:06\nis 2.2\n11:08\n9 million and the max gains that you can\n11:11\nget is 1.71\n11:13\nmillion.\n11:15\nThis is the red line is the protection\n11:17\nfloor\n11:19\nand the blue line\n11:23\nthis blue line is the upside cap and\n11:25\nthis\n11:29\nyeah this is the upside cap. You can see\n11:32\nit'll once it hits the 425 it'll it\n11:37\nstarts to move up.\n11:39\nNow I'm going to move on to the validate\n11:42\nstage. So net premium verifi ver verify\n11:46\nthe calculated net premium um zero cost\n11:50\ncolor ideal. So payoff diagram the\n11:53\ndownside protection point out the floor\n11:56\nthe portfolio value is capped at 100,000\n12:02\ntimes the k put which is 100,000 time\n12:04\n430 which equals $43 million plus the\n12:08\ncredit the upside cap. So the maximum\n12:11\nportfolio value is capped at 100 100,000\n12:15\ntimes 470 which is the K call which is\n12:18\n47 million plus credit.\n12:21\nThe Greek interpretations as I just kind\n12:23\nof said expo delta explains the exposure\n12:27\nto stock price moves. So since the stock\n12:29\nis delta\n12:33\none approximately one and the options\n12:36\nhave opposed\n12:38\ndeltas the overall portfol port\n12:40\nportfolio delta will be closer to but\n12:43\nless than 100\n12:46\n$100,000\n12:48\nindicating a slightly reduced exposure\n12:50\nto price changes. As for gamma gamma\n12:53\nexplains the change in delta. The collar\n12:55\nhas a negative gamma, meaning its delta\n12:58\nbecomes less sensitive as the stock\n12:59\nmoves away from the strike.\n13:05\nGoing on to theta. Theta explains time\n13:08\ndecay. A net credit collar often has\n13:11\npositive theta, meaning it makes money\n13:13\nas time passes.\n13:17\nNow I'm going to move on to the evolve\n13:19\nstage. So the overall sense, does the\n13:20\nstrategy meet the initial goal? Yes, the\n13:22\ncolor provides protective floor\n13:25\num and protection.\n13:28\nYes, the color provides protection as\n13:31\nthe floor at K put and a cost-effective\n13:34\nsolution low or zero net premium by\n13:36\nsacrificing limited upside which is\n13:38\ncapped at the K call\n13:41\nalternatives is briefly restated why\n13:46\nis\n13:47\nprotection the some of the alternatives\n13:50\nare the protective put but that was too\n13:53\nexpensive and the put spread which\n13:56\nleaves too much of a tail risk at the\n13:58\nAnd\n14:00\nfor optimization, can we move the\n14:03\nstrike? Moving Kp put moves closer.\n14:07\nMoving Kp put closer to so increases the\n14:10\nprotection but requires selling the\n14:12\nselling a lower K call which reduces\n14:14\nupside or paying a net debt.\n14:20\nMoving K call higher. This increases the\n14:22\npotential upside but requires buying a\n14:24\nlower K put which is reducing the\n14:26\nprotection that you would get or paying\n14:29\na higher net debt.\n14:32\nMoving on to reflect. So for the\n14:35\nconclusion\n14:36\nI'm going to kind of summarize the\n14:38\nfindings. The zerocost caller achieves\n14:41\nthe client's goal. We locked in a floor\n14:44\nat $430,\n14:46\nkept upside potential up to $470\n14:50\nand executed the trade for a small net\n14:54\ncredit. This is an effective way to\n14:56\nprotect a significant rally without\n14:58\nincurring substantial hedging costs. So\n15:00\nrecap on the driver techniques of what\n15:03\nwe kind of just covered. So for D, we\n15:06\nidentified the goal, which is the\n15:07\nprotective gains and balance costs. R is\n15:09\nwe an analyze the options and chose to\n15:12\nuse color. I I we used Python to price\n15:16\noptions, calculate the net credit\n15:20\nslash credit or cost and find the\n15:22\nGreeks. B we confirmed the payoff\n15:24\ndiagram and interpreted the Greeks delta\n15:27\ntheta and other and the others. E, we\n15:31\nconducted that we concluded that the\n15:34\nzero cost collar was the most balanced\n15:36\napproach and R we are now providing a\n15:40\nconclusion for the strategies\n15:42\neffectiveness. That is all for my\n15:44\nsession 11 assignment and thank you for\n15:47listening."
