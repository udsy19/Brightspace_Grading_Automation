  "transcript": "0:00\nSo for the session 11 assignment, uh\n0:03\nstarting off with the define and\n0:04\ndiscover stage. So the whole point of\n0:07\nthis is I have to evaluate Apple's\n0:09\nhypothetical $90 billion share\n0:12\nrepurchase.\n0:14\nUm and I must deliver a recommendation\n0:17\nthat explains stakeholder impacts,\n0:20\nagency considerations,\n0:22\nand value creation versus value transfer\n0:24\noutcomes. So the gibbons are there's a\n0:28\n$90 billion share repurchase.\n0:31\nThey have $165 billion in cash and\n0:34\ninvestments and 100 billion in annual\n0:37\nfree cash flow.\n0:40\nThere's 110 billion in debt. There's a\n0:44\nPE ratio of 30\n0:47\ndividend yield of.5%.\n0:51\n15 and a half billion shares outstanding\n0:54\nwhich Birkshshire owns 6% and the CEO\n0:57\nholds three million shares.\n1:00\nUh retail investors average 100 shares\n1:04\nand employees have $170 strike price\n1:07\noption. Uh the proposal is a $90 billion\n1:11\nbuyback executed over one year, which is\n1:13\nroughly 10% of the market cap.\n1:16\nAnd the alternatives\n1:18\nuh are a $6 special dividend, strategic\n1:23\nAI, VR acquisition, debt reduction, and\n1:26\nincremental research and development.\n1:31\nSo putting those into here, here's all\n1:34\nthe the givens.\n1:36\nUh and it calculates the number of\n1:38\nshares to be repurchased using the share\n1:42\nprice\n1:44\nuh the shares outstanding the earnings\n1:46\nper share and\n1:50\num the new cash and investments\n1:53\nuh which is done using these\n1:55\ncalculations here. So after running that\n1:59\nyou get uh the initials and then the\n2:02\nnumber of shares to be repurchased which\n2:04\nis 486\n2:06\nmillion.\n2:08\nUh the new out shares outstanding is\n2:10\n15.01 billion. Uh the new earnings per\n2:14\nshare is 6.45 and the new or the current\n2:17\nis 6.45 and the new is 6.66.\n2:21\nUh the percentage increase in earnings\n2:23\nper share is 3.24% 24% and the new cash\n2:26\nand investments is 75 billion.\n2:30\nFollowing that, I took the Birkshshire\n2:32\nownership percentage and I calculated\n2:35\nthe number of shares owned and the value\n2:37\nof shares owned\n2:40\num and that gave me these numbers. So\n2:44\nthe number of shares owned by\n2:45\nBirkshshire Hathway is 930 million and\n2:48\nthe value of shares owned uh before and\n2:52\nafter the buyback at the current price\n2:54\nare as follows\n2:56\n172 billion.\n2:59\nUm and then the new ownership percentage\n3:03\nis 6.19%.\n3:06\nSo now the impact on employees with the\n3:09\ncurrent um\n3:12\nstock option price ofund\n3:16\nuh the current stock option price\n3:19\nis $170.\n3:23\nSo\n3:25\ncalculating that the new theoretical\n3:28\nshare price based on the earnings per\n3:30\nshare increases 190.99\n3:33\nand the value per option per share\n3:36\nbefore buybacks 15 and after in theory\n3:40\nis 20.99.\n3:42\nSo the buyback makes the these options\n3:44\nmore valuable due to a potential\n3:47\nincrease in the share price driven by\n3:49\nthe increased EPS.\n3:52\nuh and then the impact on financial\n3:55\nstructure and flexibility.\n3:57\nSo with the $ 110 billion uh debt\n4:04\num and calculating the debt to equity\n4:07\nratio,\n4:09\nyou get the initial market uh\n4:12\ncapitalization which is the equity which\n4:14\nis um 2.8675 8 675 trillion\n4:20\nand um in theory\n4:23\nuh reflecting the EPS gain after the\n4:26\nbuyback is the same\n4:29\nand the initial debt to equity ratio and\n4:32\nthe new debt to equity ratio is also the\n4:35\nsame. Um\n4:41\nfinally or next the um impact on the\n4:44\nCEO's shareholdings\n4:47\n3 million which would be worth 3 million\n4:50\nshares which at the current price is 550\n4:53\nmillion um and after the buy pack at the\n4:56\ntheoretical new price it's 572 million\n4:59\nalmost 573 million\n5:02\num and then the CEO personally has an\n5:05\nincrease of almost $18 million\n5:08\nuh in stock\n5:10\nuh price increases.\n5:14\nSo after quantifying the stakeholder\n5:16\noutcomes under the buyback uh I need to\n5:20\ncompare the buyback the buyback to all\n5:23\nthe different alternatives\n5:25\nusing EPS ownership changes ROIC\n5:29\nleverage and strategic fit. So the\n5:32\nalternative capital\n5:34\nuh allocation which is the $6 dividend\n5:38\nis shown here. And essentially what that\n5:42\nsays is the cost of the $6 special\n5:45\ndividend is 93\n5:49\nmillion\n5:50\nsorry 93 billion. Um and the initial\n5:53\ncash investments is 165 billion. And the\n5:57\nthe so the cash um and investments after\n5:59\nthe dividend is 72 billion.\n6:02\nUm and there are some immediate benefits\n6:05\nto shareholders and the company's uh\n6:08\ncash position using this. The\n6:10\nshareholders receive a direct cash\n6:12\npayment of $6 per share through the\n6:15\ndividend and the company's cash reserves\n6:18\nare significantly reduced to 93 billion.\n6:23\nUm,\n6:25\nand the pros of that is there's a direct\n6:27\nshareholder return there. There's\n6:29\nflexibility for the shareholders.\n6:32\nUm, it's usually a signal for financial\n6:35\nhealth. Um, because Apple has strong\n6:39\ncash flows and a healthy balance sheet\n6:42\nwhich suggests confidence in his\n6:45\nfinancial uh position and for future\n6:47\nprospects. And then it's it's a very\n6:50\nsimple $6 per share. So it's simple and\n6:53\nand transparent.\n6:55\nUm the cons of that however are there's\n6:58\nno impact on the earnings per share.\n7:02\nUm dividends are typically taxed as\n7:04\nordinary income. So there are some tax\n7:06\nimplications\n7:09\num through that for shareholders. There\n7:11\nis a reduced cash uh reserve which can\n7:14\nbe negative\n7:16\nuh\n7:18\nfor the company's financial flexibility\n7:20\nfor future strategic investments like\n7:23\nacquisitions and research and\n7:24\ndevelopment.\n7:26\nUm it's not an investment for future\n7:29\ngrowth. It says unlike R&D and strategic\n7:32\nacquisition, a special dividend does not\n7:34\ndirectly invest the company's long-term\n7:36\ngrowth or a competitive position. It's\n7:39\npurely a return on capital\n7:42\nand then there's no capital structure\n7:44\noptimization.\n7:46\nUh it does not change the company's debt\n7:48\nto equity ratio or other capital\n7:50\nstructure metrics.\n7:54\nUm and then so the next alternative is\n7:58\num debt reduction which running that\n8:01\nhere pretty simple company's initial\n8:04\ndebt 110 billion the debt reduction\n8:06\namount 90 billion remaining debt after\n8:08\nreduction 20 billion.\n8:11\nSo\n8:14\nthe pros of that is improved financial\n8:18\nhealth and stability which because it\n8:20\nreduces financial leverage\n8:23\nmaking the company more resilient to\n8:24\neconomic downturns\n8:27\num and less susceptible to interest rate\n8:31\nfluctuations.\n8:33\nUh it's increased borrowing capacity\n8:37\num due to its higher credit rating.\n8:41\nUh lower interest costs,\n8:44\ndirect and measurable financial benefit\n8:47\nfrom the reduced interest payments which\n8:50\nboosts net income and cash flow.\n8:52\nAnd then uh flexibility and strategic uh\n8:56\nmaneuver. A healthier balance sheet\n8:58\nprovides greater structural uh greater\n9:00\nstrategic flexibility\n9:03\nallowing the company to seize\n9:04\nopportunities\n9:06\num or or weather challenges without\n9:10\nundue financial stress. And then the\n9:12\ncons of this there's no direct growth.\n9:15\nThe opportunity cost is very large.\n9:17\nUsing a $90 billion\n9:20\nuh using $90 billion for debt reduction\n9:24\nmeans that the capital is not available\n9:26\nfor the initiatives that could drive\n9:27\nfuture revenue and earnings growth\n9:31\nand that it may not be optimal if debt\n9:33\nis cheap as well\n9:36\nuh for incremental R&D assuming a 90\n9:39\nbillion investment. Uh the potential\n9:42\nlong-term benefits would be innovation\n9:45\nand new product development. So like a\n9:47\nsubstantial investment in R&D can lead\n9:50\nto breakthroughs, new technologies\n9:53\nuh and the development of innovative\n9:55\nproducts or services which could um this\n10:00\nis financial this is fundamental for a\n10:02\nsustained competitive advantage and\n10:05\nlong-term revenue growth. uh market of\n10:08\nmarket leadership and competitive\n10:10\nadvantage. By heavily investing in R&D,\n10:12\nthe company can establish or maintain\n10:13\nits position as a market leader,\n10:15\ndifferentiating its offerings uh from\n10:18\ncompetitors and creating barriers to\n10:20\nentry for new players.\n10:23\nUh sustainable growth\n10:26\nuh can successful R&D can unlock\n10:29\nentirely new markets and create new\n10:31\nrevenue streams.\n10:34\num talent attraction and retention. So\n10:37\nif you have like the cutting edge\n10:40\nuh top-of-the-line products, it can\n10:42\nattract top uh scientific and\n10:45\nengineering talent\n10:47\nand uh brand value and reputation.\n10:51\nObviously, if you have the\n10:52\ntop-of-the-line products through a big\n10:55\ncommitment to R&D, you can be perceived\n10:58\nas an innovative company uh which can\n11:01\nenhance which will enhance brand value\n11:03\nand reputation among customers, partners\n11:06\nand investors.\n11:09\nUm the problem with uh massive R&D\n11:14\nu investment is it's uncertain for\n11:17\nsuccess.\n11:18\nUm, not all projects will succeed and\n11:22\nsome might fail entirely leading to\n11:24\nmassive potential massive sunk costs\n11:27\nwithout a return on investment.\n11:31\nLong development cycles. It could take\n11:34\nyears for research to translate into\n11:37\nmarketable products.\n11:40\nAnd in the tech space especially, years\n11:43\nis more like decades.\n11:45\num difficulty in quantifying immediate\n11:48\nreturns.\n11:50\nUh unlike a buyback that provides\n11:52\nimmediate EPS boost or a debt reduction\n11:54\nthat lowers interest expenses, uh the\n11:58\nfinan financial returns of R&D are often\n12:00\nnot are often difficult to quantify in\n12:03\nthe short term and can be highly var\n12:05\nvariable.\n12:07\nuh market acceptance risk.\n12:10\nEven though you you could have a\n12:11\nsuccessful innovation, it might not gain\n12:13\nmarket traction or could be superseded\n12:16\nby competitor by competitors.\n12:20\nThe opportunity cost is massive. $90\n12:23\nbillion means the capital's unavailable\n12:25\nfor other immediate usage.\n12:28\nUm\n12:30\nand the execution risk effective\n12:32\nmanagement of large R&D projects like a\n12:35\n$90 billion hypothetical project\n12:39\nincluding resource allocation allocation\n12:43\nuh project prioriti prioritization\n12:46\nand commercial commercialization\n12:49\nstrategies uh are complex and carry\n12:53\nsignificant execution risk.\n12:57\nSo overall the the summary of comparing\n13:01\nalternative the alternatives\n13:05\num\n13:06\nis\n13:08\nthe special dividend. The pros are it's\n13:11\ndirect\n13:12\num provides universal benefit regardless\n13:15\nof selling signals strong financial\n13:17\nhealth. It's transparent and it's\n13:20\nimmediate cash return to all\n13:21\nshareholders. The cons of that is there\n13:24\nare no impact on EPS.\n13:27\nIt's tax inefficient for shareholders as\n13:29\nthey get taxed on their dividends.\n13:32\nUh significantly reduces cash reserves\n13:34\nand financial flexibility and does not\n13:36\ninvest in future growth or optimiz\n13:38\noptimize capital structure.\n13:42\nUm\n13:47\nit the value creation/transfer does not\n13:50\ncreate new intrinsic value for the\n13:52\ncompany and it's less effective than a\n13:53\nbuyback for per share metrics but it's\n13:57\nmore equitable equitable\n14:00\ndistribution to all shareholders.\n14:03\nuh the risk it's low risk for the\n14:05\ncompany but reduces financial buffer\n14:08\nhigh risk high tax risk for\n14:10\nshareholders.\n14:12\nUm and the strategic fit of this is it's\n14:15\nsuitable for companies with excess cash\n14:17\nand limited growth opportunities that\n14:20\nwish to re reward shareholders\n14:23\nuh but it's less strategic than other\n14:25\noptions.\n14:27\nthe strategic AI/VR acquisition. The\n14:31\npros are potential for significant new\n14:35\nintrinsic value creation through market\n14:37\nexpansion, technological advancement,\n14:39\ncompetitive advantage, synergies, and\n14:41\ndiversification can drive long-term\n14:44\norganic growth. The cons of this is high\n14:47\nrisk due to integration challenges,\n14:50\nvaluation uncertainty, execution risk,\n14:53\ntechnological\n14:55\nobsolence\n14:57\nuh and regulatory scrutiny. Uh it\n15:01\nreduces financial flexibility for other\n15:03\nuses and the opportunity costs if the\n15:05\nacquisition fails or underperforms.\n15:09\nUh it has a high potential for new\n15:11\nintrinsic value creation if successful\n15:13\nbut also a high value for also a high\n15:17\npotential for value destruction if\n15:18\npoorly executed or o overvalued.\n15:22\nUm the risk it's high operational\n15:25\nfinancial and strategic risk. It's an\n15:28\nexcellent fit for companies seeking to\n15:30\nenter new high growth markets, acquire\n15:34\ncritical technologies or diversify their\n15:36\nbusiness model assuming careful\n15:38\ndiligence and integration planning\n15:42\nfor debt reduction.\n15:44\nUh the pros are it substantially\n15:46\nimproves financial health and stability.\n15:49\nUm significantly lowers financial risk.\n15:53\nuh reduced interest expenses boosting\n15:55\nnet income likely leads to a credit\n15:57\nrating upgrade and increased future\n16:00\nborrowing capacity at lower rates. It's\n16:03\na clear and measurable financial\n16:04\nbenefit.\n16:06\nOn the con for this does not directly\n16:08\ndrive operational growth or innovation.\n16:12\nUm, it is a high opportunity cost if\n16:15\nhigh if higher return investments are\n16:17\nforegone and it may not be the most\n16:19\ncapital efficient if existing debt is\n16:22\nvery cheap.\n16:27\nIt's very low risk as it strengthens the\n16:29\nbalance sheet and reduces fixed\n16:31\nobligations. It's a strong fit for\n16:33\ncompanies with high debt levels or those\n16:35\nseeking to derisk their financial\n16:37\nprofile and improve their capacity for\n16:40\nstrate future strategic moves. And then\n16:44\nfinally, incremental R&D, high potential\n16:47\nfor new intrinsic value creation through\n16:49\ninnovation, new project development,\n16:51\nsustained competitive edge or and\n16:54\nlong-term organic growth and it enhances\n16:57\nbrand value and attracts talent. Cons of\n16:59\nthis is it's high highly uncertain\n17:03\nof success.\n17:05\nUm could take a very long time to\n17:08\ndevelop years potentially more. Uh\n17:12\ndifficulty in quantifying immediate\n17:14\nreturns.\n17:15\nUh the market may not accept it\n17:18\nuh these new products or they might not\n17:21\nthey might underperform.\n17:24\num significant opportunity cost if R&D\n17:26\nprojects fail to yield results\n17:30\nand the execution risk in managing large\n17:34\nR&D portfolio.\n17:37\nSorry about that. My video cut out. Um\n17:40\nthe execution risk in uh managing large\n17:43\nR&D portfolios is also a con.\n17:47\nUm\n17:48\nit's a high technological and market\n17:51\nrisk with long-term payoff uh\n17:53\nuncertainty. And this is a crucial this\n17:58\nthis R&D investment is crucial for\n18:00\ntechnologydriven companies or those in\n18:03\ndynamic industries that rely on\n18:04\ncontinuous innovation to maintain\n18:06\ncompetitive advantage and drive future\n18:08\nrevenue streams.\n18:12\nMy overall recommendation\n18:15\nis that you go with the R&D and that's\n18:19\nfor a couple reasons. The sustainable\n18:21\nintrinsic value creation,\n18:24\nuh the competitive advantage and market\n18:26\nleadership,\n18:27\nuh it mitigates agency conflicts\n18:31\nand it's optimized uh long-term\n18:34\nshareholder returns. Although it's\n18:36\nuncertain\n18:38\num in the long run, a company like Apple\n18:41\nwith massive R&D usually comes out on\n18:44\ntop.\n18:46\nUm and then the uh prudent use of cash\n18:48\nreserves\n18:51\nand following that I created a EPS path\n18:57\ngraph. So running that\n19:00\nit came up with this which is the EPS\n19:03\npath comparison with the earnings per\n19:06\nshare on the y-axis and the years on the\n19:10\nxaxis. So this is what it could\n19:12\nhypothetically look like the incremental\n19:15\nR&D\n19:17\num which would be here. So in in the\n19:19\nshort term the EPS will go down but\n19:22\noverall it it should increase\n19:25versus the share buyback."
