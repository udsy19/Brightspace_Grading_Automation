  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital structure factors (cash balance, liquidity needs, after-tax cost of debt, tax treatment, signaling) and provides a clear directional preference to buy back shares. This recommendation is supported by modeled outcomes and validation of liquidity, demonstrating thorough, conceptually accurate reasoning across DRIVER stages.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly references a Python script, reports scenario outputs with specific EPS numbers, and performs validation checks (liquidity after the buyback) that align with those outputs. These elements show executed code/results and interpretation across Represent, Implement, and Validate, meeting the introductory-level evidence standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes the results shown in a data table and explains the scenarios and units (EPS in dollars, ownership in percentages). They also tie a visualization to stakeholder impact and compare trade-offs between options. This satisfies the criterion with sufficient depth for a moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never identifies the interest tax shield of debt, and does not discuss increased financial risk or distress costs; the focus is on EPS and “after-tax cost” without articulating the trade-off. Despite using DRIVER stages to compare options, the core capital structure trade-off is missing, so this criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student gives only cursory mention of agency (management–EPS alignment) and notes gains for remaining/large shareholders but does not analyze who loses or how incentives diverge across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, and large holders. There is no discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. Given these substantive omissions, the treatment is insufficient for this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discussed how financing choices affect EPS, but did not explain that leverage amplifies both gains and losses, nor did they note that debt adds fixed obligations that raise default risk. Given the lack of risk discussion and no coverage of leverage amplification, the treatment is incomplete for this criterion despite some implementation modeling.",
