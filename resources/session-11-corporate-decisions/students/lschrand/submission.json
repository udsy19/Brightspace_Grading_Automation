  "transcript": "0:02\nAll right. Hello. My name is Levi Shrant\n0:06\nand this is assignment 11 for management\n0:08\n310. And today we are uh tasked to\n0:12\nevaluate Apple's hypothetical\n0:16\nuh $90 billion share repurchase using\n0:20\nthe driver method.\n0:22\nSo the situation\n0:24\nwe have\n0:26\num\n0:29\nis\n0:31\nuh Apple has\n0:34\n$90 billion in cash and if that cash is\n0:36\njust sitting in the bank then it is not\n0:38\ndoing its shareholders\n0:40\nor bond hold or uh it shareholders any\n0:45\ngood. And so they're trying to determine\n0:48\nhow they can use that money\n0:51\nto better serve their stakeholders.\n0:57\nSo using the driver method um the\n1:00\nframework I modeled the financial\n1:02\nimpacts of this proposal uh against\n1:06\nthree alternatives. So they could either\n1:08\nspend the money by paying out a special\n1:11\ndividend.\n1:13\nUh they could reduce their debt as we\n1:16\nsee uh let's see they have $110 billion\n1:22\nof debt.\n1:25\nUm\n1:27\nor they could use it as a strategic\n1:30\nacquisition such as buying uh shares\n1:33\nback. So my goal is to determine which\n1:36\npath\n1:37\nwhich of these three options maximizes\n1:39\nApple's long-term value.\n1:42\nAll right. So\n1:45\nlet's move over to my Python script and\n1:50\nstarting with the define and discover.\n1:54\nSo here we see the problem Apple faces\n1:59\nin liquidizing their cash. Um so we know\n2:04\nthat the company holds 165 billion in\n2:08\ncash in investments\n2:12\nuh which is generating a suboptimal\n2:14\nreturn while operations turn out like\n2:19\nabout 100 billion and free cash flow\n2:22\nannually.\n2:24\nSo really the main problem we're looking\n2:27\nat here is the efficiency\n2:30\nand holding this much cash drags down\n2:32\nreturn on invested capital.\n2:35\nUh so we need to deploy this 90 billion\n2:38\neffectively. Um\n2:42\nso we need to dis deploy that 90 billion\n2:46\neffectively but we also need to\n2:49\nensure that we maintain enough liquidity\n2:53\nfor our operations which is which is\n2:56\nabout at least $20 billion.\n3:01\nSo that's what we have here. It's really\n3:04\njust all that information all those\n3:06\nprint statements. So the phase two of\n3:09\nthe framework is represent\n3:11\nuh so here we have\n3:14\nthe\n3:18\nuh okay yeah so for here this is where I\n3:21\nbuilt a capital allocation model and so\n3:26\nthis what this model simulates\n3:29\nis the immediate mechanics of the\n3:31\nbalance sheet. So for buybacks the logic\n3:34\nis simple. We just reduce the share\n3:37\ncount. Uh which mathematically\n3:40\nlifts the earnings per share.\n3:43\nAnd for debt payown we obviously would\n3:46\nbe reducing our interest expense which\n3:49\nincreases our net income. So the core\n3:52\nquestion of this whole model right here\n3:58\nis which of these mechanics creates more\n4:00\nvalue per share?\n4:03\nSo that's the question we're going to\n4:05\nanswer down at implement.\n4:11\nOkay. So\n4:14\nhere I ran four scenarios through the\n4:16\nmodel as you can see down here in the\n4:20\nresults in the the data table right\n4:24\nhere.\n4:27\nAnd so here we see the base case EPS is\n4:31\naround $6.17.\n4:35\nUm and then we have a special dividend\n4:38\nwhich leaves EPS unchanged at $6.17\n4:44\nright here.\n4:47\nUh this is because it doesn't improve\n4:49\nthe operational metric or um the share\n4:53\ncount as well. Uh, so the debt payown\n4:56\nraises EPS to $6.35.\n5:01\nSo that's better. And the reason that\n5:05\njumps is because we're saving on\n5:06\ninterest. Uh, the buyback is the\n5:09\nsuperior option as we can see uh because\n5:13\nit it's delivering an EPS, the highest\n5:16\nEPS of $6.37.\n5:19\nUm so even though the difference between\n5:22\ndebt payown and buyback seem like small\n5:24\ncents like on 15 billion shares\n5:28\nthat that's a lot of money. So uh you\n5:33\nknow it's all about the scale.\n5:37\nAll right. So now moving down to our\n5:39\nvalidate.\n5:41\nLet's see code for this. Yeah.\n5:46\nOkay.\n5:48\nSo, moving down to validate, I stress\n5:50\ntested uh this recommendation that we\n5:53\nhad. So, first liquidity. So, after\n5:57\nspending $90 billion, Apple retains 75\n6:00\nbillion in cash. So, this obviously\n6:02\npasses our our safety measures of\n6:05\nkeeping at least 20 billion for\n6:06\noperational costs. Uh so the second uh\n6:11\nsecond thing I looked at was\n6:15\num our value creation.\n6:18\nUm\n6:22\nand\n6:26\nlet's see.\n6:35\nOkay. So So this\n6:39\nI'm just trying to\n6:47\nbuy back. Okay. So this is just focusing\n6:51\non not not the materialistic improvement\n6:55\nand betterment of\n6:59\nof\n7:00\nthe their products like iPhone but you\n7:03\nknow concentrating on the ownership of\n7:04\nof the existing cash flows.\n7:09\nUm and then third the concentration of\n7:12\nit and this increases the ownership\n7:15\nstake of long-term holders from 6% to\n7:18\n6.2%. 2% 6.2% without them expending any\n7:22\nof their capital.\n7:26\nUm so and then evolve\n7:29\nuh which is this is where I looked at\n7:31\nthe strategic tradeoffs and agency\n7:34\ntheory. So why not the other two options\n7:37\nwhich are dividends and debt payown. And\n7:39\nthis is because dividends are tax\n7:41\ninefficient for many investors.\n7:45\nUh, and the debt payown is actually\n7:47\nvalue destructive right now because\n7:49\nApple's after tax cost of debt is only\n7:52\nabout 3.2%. So buying back stock that\n7:56\nearns a higher yield is a a better use\n8:00\nof their capital.\n8:04\nAnd so here this image just displays\n8:08\nwhat the implement se segment did. Um it\n8:11\njust gives us you know the cases for\n8:15\neach EPS\n8:18\nuh scenario and as we determined uh the\n8:22\nbuyback had the highest\n8:26\nand then here's the just an image of the\n8:28\nBirkshshire ownership percentage versus\n8:31\nthe buyback size.\n8:33\nSo in reflection\n8:36\nuh my final recommendation would be to\n8:38\nproceed with the $90 billion buyback but\n8:40\nsplit execution over four quarters. So\n8:44\nthe the rationale behind that as you can\n8:47\nsee below is a value transfer. So\n8:49\nbuyback transfers value to remaining\n8:52\nshareholders and the concentration\n8:55\nincreases.\n8:57\nuh the EPS accretion\n9:00\nprovides strongest EPS growth of 3.24%\n9:04\ncompared to debt reduction which is\n9:06\n2.98%.\n9:08\nan agency which is just aligning\n9:11\nmanagement incentives with EPS targets\n9:13\nbut requires governance oversight to\n9:16\nprevent short-term uh termism\n9:20\nand then signaling which is a $90\n9:23\nbillion commitment signals just a\n9:25\nmassive confidence in ECF FCF stability\n9:29\nand supporting the PE multiple and then\n9:32\ntradeoff is dividend\n9:35\ntax efficient for many holders as we've\n9:37\nalready gone over and debt is already\n9:39\nmanageable.\n9:43\nSo, uh yeah, that that would be my final\n9:47\nrecommendation which would be to proceed\n9:48\nwith the $90 billion payback since we\n9:51\nknow that we'll have at least $20\n9:52\nbillion\n9:54\nfor uh operational costs and then uh we\n9:59\nwould split that execution over full\n10:01course and that is all. Thank you."
