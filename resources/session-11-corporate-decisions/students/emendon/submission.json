  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Ethan Menonza and\ntoday I'm going to be doing the session\n11 assignment which is\nthe corporate financial decision\nanalysis.\nSo first we're going to be going through\nthe driver analysis for this. And so\nfirst I do the define and discover phase\nwhere I give the prompt to act as a\nsenior corporate financial analyst and\ngive him all of the the essential the\ncapital allocation snapshot\nand essentially gave a problem statement\nand order for me to just give a\ndefinition for the entire assignment. So\nhere uh it gives me the stakeholder the\nconflict map. So the context which is\nthe capital structure overview which is\nso essentially we have the war chest\nwhich is 165 billion in liquidity and\n100 billion in FCF.\nAdditionally the constraint which is the\nprimary tension is not the cash is not\nif the cash should be deployed but how\nto deploy the cash in order to maximize\nvalue. And so we have four alternatives.\nFirst is a share repurchase which is a\n$90 million buyback.\nNext is a special dividend which is a\n$90 million a billion dollar onetime\npayout. Next is a strategic acquisition\nM&A deal. And finally the debt pay the\ndebt paid out. And here as you can see\num the main central conflict in this\nscenario is the dividend versus buyback.\nSo the buyback is you know supportive\npositive and increases C option value as\nwell as high tax efficiency. Whereas the\nbuyback is the opposite of that and\nhence the current analysis is that as we\ncan see here management has a strong\nfinancial incentive to prefer buyback as\nwe can see based on this data. Next, I\nask the U AI in order to help me\nrepresent and visualize logic in a\nbetter scenario. And here it tells me to\nuse the pizza and the wall mental\nmethod.\nAnd so essentially the buyback the\nconcentration effect. So the analogy is\nimagine a pizza cut into 10 slices and I\nown one slice. The company uses this\ncash to buy two slices from other people\nand throws them away, retires them. The\npiece is now only eight slices, but we\nstill only own one slice, but our slice\nis now a larger percentage, meaning our\nvalue increases. Essentially, the EPS\ngoes up. Next is the special dividend,\nthe force withdrawal.\nUm, where it's a it's a value transfer\ndynamic. And finally, we have the the\ndebt payown, which is the risk shield.\nEssentially, risk reduction,\ndeleveraging all of our assets.\nHere we can see the summary table for\nthe three different uh types of uh three\ndifferent ideas. The three different\noptions. First is the buyback. The EPS\ngoes up. The dividend the stock the\nstock price goes down. Um and finally\nthe debt payown where risk goes down.\nAnd so I ask it to help me to implement\nimplement the the code as you can see\nbased on our discover and our uh\nrepresent stage and here we have the the\ndata the code. So first obviously\nimporting the necessary pandas and map\nlibs. Next is a define and discover\nwhich is the the financial snapshot and\nthe derived inputs.\nNext we go through the represent stage\ndefining the scenario logic and the the\nfive different scenarios that we have.\nSo first is the baseline where we do\nnothing. Second is the buyback scenario.\nNext is the special dividend scenario.\nUh next is the um\nuh acquisition scenario and finally the\ndebt reduction scenario and all of these\nare their own essential um dictionaries.\nRight.\nNext we need to validate them and\nessentially print the table for analysis\nand create a comparison chart. And\nfinally annotate bar with the values.\nAnd here as we can see this is the code\nthat is given to us. So here essentially\nwe see the stakeholder impact analysis\nfor the five scenarios. And here we can\nsee the EPS values as well as the net\ncache values. And for the end comments\nfor each of the values. So zero is safe\nbut inefficient.\nThe first one boosts EPS significantly.\nCU investors are happily. Sec uh number\ntwo dividend immediate cash but no EPS\nboost. Third strategic growth but it's a\nhigh risk. And fourth is the lowest risk\nbond holders happy but very low return.\nAnd as you can see from the uh the five\ndifferent scenarios the acquisition\nseems to have the highest EPS uh value.\nas we can see in comparison to all the\nother um\nall of the other scenarios.\nAnd so when we go to the uh validate\nstage of this\nof this um of this se section, it's\nreally important to understand first\nwhether it's real growth or if it's\nfinancial enduring. Is this real\nbusiness growth? No, because real growth\ncomes from selling more iPhones,\nlaunching new services, improving\nmargins in the model. Net income did not\nincrease in the buyback scenario.\nSo this is essentially final financial\nengineering because we increase the EPS\nby reducing the share count and not by\nactually um create like creating new\nvalue. We essentially reduce the amount\nof share share count and thus increasing\nthe the perceived value of all our\nshares, right?\nAnd so essentially the move says for the\nvarious different scenarios the buyback\nis we are undervalued. The special\ndividend is the growth is slowing and\nthe debt payown means we have no ideas\nessentially. The next step is to evolve.\nOne of the big things we can do is\nevolve in the um co incentives. The most\nmost executive compensation plans use\nEPS targets to trigger bonuses and hence\nit would be better to focus on EPS\nbonuses. Next, the opportunity cost. We\ncannot choose every single option even\nthough some of them are better than the\nothers. Um, and one choosing only one\noption has a lot of drawbacks which is\nimportant to take into account in the\nnext uh iteration of this of this um of\nthis assignment.\nAnd next is the reflecting stage.\nEssentially uh it's really important to\nunderstand the evidence like looking at\nthe numbers and figuring out you know\nwhich one is the best option because\nthis doesn't showcase the risk either.\nIt only shows what the earnings per\nshare are and gives a comment on the\nrisk but not really. And it would be\nreally good to create a mathematical\nequation in the future to also take into\naccount risk, take into account the\nvolatility\num and figure out the the true impact of\nnine of a 90 billion spend, right? And\nthus the trade-offs is obviously the\ndebt reduction, paying down debt is\ninefficient and the strategic\nacquisition, you know, the regul\nregulatory risk is prohibited.\nAnd yeah, that is my my thing. Thankyou."
