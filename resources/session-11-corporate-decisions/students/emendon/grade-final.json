  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student addresses all primary groups: shareholders (EPS/stock price impacts), management (explicit incentive to prefer buybacks), and bondholders (debt reduction makes “bond holders happy”). They also nod to other stakeholders via “regulatory risk.” Given the moderate standard and the scenario-based stakeholder impact analysis, coverage is sufficiently complete for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a Define & Discover phase (problem statement, stakeholders, objectives) before modeling and code implementation. The student states the D-stage content and then describes using that output to drive representation and implementation, meeting the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented a represent-stage plan (scenario logic, five scenarios) and specified metrics/outputs (tables, comparison chart) before implementation, then implemented code and produced the described artifacts. This shows a systematic linkage from plan to implemented analysis, meeting the moderate DRIVER standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that debt increases financial risk (via “risk reduction” when paying it down) and reflects on incorporating risk, satisfying the risk side. However, they never identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield), discussing tax efficiency only for buybacks. Given the moderate standard, this is a correct but incomplete treatment, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly flags incentive divergence (management preferring buybacks due to EPS comp; bondholders preferring deleveraging) and notes who benefits under some options. However, they don’t substantively cover employees or large holders, nor do they explain asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks. Given moderate strictness, the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, so Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links financing choices to outcomes: buybacks boosting EPS and debt reduction lowering risk, and they note lower risk often means lower return. However, they do not explain how leverage amplifies both returns and risks in depth, nor do they mention debt’s fixed interest obligations and default risk. Thus, the treatment is conceptually correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.",
