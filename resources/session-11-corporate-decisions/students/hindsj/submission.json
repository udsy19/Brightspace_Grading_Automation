  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, I'm John and today for sessions\n0:03\n11, uh we're going to be doing a\n0:05\ncorporate financial decision analysis.\n0:07\nSo, we're going to be evaluating Apple's\n0:10\nuh $90 billion share uh repurchase and\n0:15\nwe're going to be acting as an\n0:16\nindependent analyst and we're going to\n0:18\nbe determining uh whether that buyback\n0:20\nof 90 billion shares is going to uh\n0:24\ncreate uh value relative to the\n0:26\nalternate uses of cash that uh balance\n0:30\nthe stakeholders incentives. So, we have\n0:32\na little snapshot of our capital\n0:36\nallocation. We have 165 billion in cash\n0:39\nand investments. We have 100 billion in\n0:41\nannual free cash flow.\n0:44\nWe're also given $185 share price with a\n0:48\n30 P& ratio.5%\n0:52\ndividend yield and we have 15.5 billion\n0:55\nshares outstanding. And we have some um\n1:00\nstuff on our balance sheet. And then\n1:01\nwe're going to have our uh proposal of\n1:04\nour buyback which will be executed over\n1:06\none year. And our all alternatives are\n1:09\ngoing to be a $6 special dividend uh a\n1:12\nstrategic AI or VR acquisition\n1:16\ndebt reduction and incremental R&D.\n1:20\nNow we're going to be looking at\n1:24\nthese four um analysis.\n1:28\nUm and starting off we're going to be\n1:30\njust jumping right into it. Uh using\n1:34\nGemini and Google Collab, we've\n1:36\ndeveloped the code to be able to\n1:37\ncalculate everything we need to. So\n1:40\nwe're inputting the data. We're doing\n1:42\nbaseline calculations\n1:44\nand we're going to have our scenario\n1:46\nmodeling. So we have uh the scenarios\n1:48\nwe're be looking at, which is our\n1:49\nbaseline, our um buyback, dividend, debt\n1:54\nreduction, and acquisition. create a\n1:56\ndata table, give a little analysis on\n1:59\nit, and then we're creating a chart to\n2:01\nvisualize that. So, first thing we're\n2:04\nlooking at is we're going to quantify\n2:06\nstakeholder outcomes. So, retail,\n2:08\nshareholder, institutional holders,\n2:11\nmanagement, employees, uh, bond holders,\n2:16\nuh, under payback. So\n2:19\njumping right into the output of our\n2:21\ncode, uh we had an highlight right here\n2:26\num the stakeholder outcomes. So for our\n2:30\nbuyback that we're looking at um for the\n2:34\nretail shareholders, the immediate EPS\n2:37\nis going to grow from 6 uh7 to 637. So,\n2:44\nthe $20 earning per uh the 20 cents\n2:47\nearning per share will inflate the uh\n2:52\nuh the earnings that the shareholders\n2:55\ntake home as well as it's going to\n2:57\nartificially drive up the share price.\n3:00\nSo with our buyback, the uh Apple is\n3:03\ngoing to buy um issued shares of their\n3:08\nuh company to take them back away from\n3:10\nthe public, inflating their uh stock\n3:13\nprice uh potentially up to\n3:17\n$191,\n3:19\nassuming that we have a constant penny.\n3:23\nWe're uh for our institutional holders,\n3:28\nit's the same thing. the um growth in\n3:31\nEPS and the potential stock price\n3:33\nappreciation is going to be a plus. But\n3:37\nlooking at other um analysis\n3:41\num weights that we are considering\n3:44\num our um institutional holders might be\n3:48\npreferring something else like the\n3:50\nacquisitions for our long-term growth or\n3:53\ndebt reduction for financial stability.\n3:56\nAnd that all is dependent on their\n3:58\ninvestment strategy and their uh risk\n4:02\ntolerance.\n4:03\nNow for buyback, the CEO is going to\n4:06\nprofit as the CEO is uh technically an\n4:10\nemployee of the company. And so\n4:15\nthere it it doesn't seem like a lot. Um\n4:18\nyeah, right here it's even though it's\n4:20\n0.00% 000%.\n4:23\nUm that jump from 0.56 billion to 0.57\n4:28\nbillion is a $10 million\n4:32\nuh increase right to the um uh CEO's\n4:36\npocket and that's going to deliver him\n4:40\nhigh profit. And we have our the\n4:44\nintrinsic value of employees\n4:47\num their options. So the 10 million\n4:49\noptions will increase from the implied\n4:52\n15 billion to um\n4:56\n21 billion with the the share add share\n5:01\nprices of 185 and the 190 share price.\n5:07\nAnd it's going to make it more valuable\n5:10\nfor the uh option holders as their\n5:14\noptions are now uh have more value and\n5:19\nhigher potential as well in in the\n5:22\nmarket. And then lastly, bond holders\n5:26\num they might see a little bit of an\n5:29\nincrease in risk as the company is\n5:32\ndealing with more cash and their um the\n5:37\nbond holders are in with their um their\n5:41\nbonds. So that's more of what they're\n5:43\nconcerned about is their debt with the\n5:45\ncompany.\n5:47\nand\n5:48\nlooking at\n5:51\nthe\n5:53\nuh buyback to uh comparative to the\n5:55\ndividends acquisition debt reduction and\n5:59\nthe alternatives we're going to be using\n6:01\nuh our metrics such as ESP uh EPS impact\n6:05\nownership changes ROIC leverage and\n6:09\nstrategic fit. So uh this is where the\n6:12\nchart I mentioned comes in earlier. So\n6:14\nyou can see a lot of what you're looking\n6:16\nat in here. So\n6:21\nwe're going to\n6:23\nuh see a transfer of ownership and buy\n6:27\nback uh dividend and\n6:31\nuh debt payown.\n6:33\nAnd so from on the buyback, we're\n6:38\ntransferring more money back um\n6:41\num into the company's possession to give\n6:45\nthem more cash to utilize. Dividends,\n6:47\nit's sending the money out to the\n6:48\nshareholders literally in an envelope.\n6:50\nUm they're paying them out dividends to\n6:52\ntransfer the value to the uh\n6:56\nshareholders and debt payown. We're\n7:00\ntransferring our money to our uh the\n7:04\nbond holders. So, the people who are\n7:07\nholding our bonds, the they're getting\n7:09\ntheir loans paid off. And what that's\n7:13\ngoing to do is on our leverage ratio\n7:18\num chart here, we can see that we have a\n7:20\nsignificant decrease in leverage ratio,\n7:23\nwhich is a good thing. We want the\n7:25\nleverage ratio to be on the lower side\n7:27\nbecause that's associated with being\n7:30\nless risky and um when\n7:34\num markets uh get unstable or you're\n7:36\nlooking at recessions, you're not\n7:38\nrelying on the debt and it's a more safe\n7:41\nalternative and especially the the bond\n7:44\nholders are going to like having their\n7:46\nbonds already paid off. And um with\n7:49\nbuyback and dividend, that's not going\n7:51\nto change any of the debt. the\n7:53\nacquisition is going to change it just a\n7:55\nlittle bit. We're going to uh decrease\n7:58\nthat leverage ratio just by a tiny bit\n7:59\nbut nothing significant.\n8:02\nAnd we also have uh the highest EPS in\n8:06\nthe acquisition as well. Now we have\n8:11\nthis chart too to show the um\n8:16\nuh the numbers of what we're looking at\n8:18\nas well. And so there is no impact on\n8:22\nthe old we just went over EPS. So going\n8:25\ninto the ownership changes\n8:28\num\n8:29\nbaseline decreases uh is is the same\n8:32\nbecause that's our baseline um the\n8:34\nownership is going to uh decrease for um\n8:39\nthe remaining shareholders as the\n8:40\ncompany is buying their own um stocks.\n8:43\nNo, no, and no for ownership changes.\n8:46\nAnd then our um return on uh uh invested\n8:51\ncapital, we're gonna have our highest be\n8:54\nthe acquisition because they're further\n8:56\ninvesting into a growth field which is\n8:59\nthe AR AI and VR\n9:02\num direction leverage. We have the\n9:05\nlowest being our debt reduction and\n9:08\nstrategic fit. They all have different\n9:10\nstrategic fits. Um the buyback is to\n9:13\nreturn capital um and it's going to\n9:16\nsignal undervaluation\n9:20\nand\n9:21\nwe're going to have um direct cash\n9:24\nreturn to shareholders with the\n9:26\ndividends. Um the strategic fit of our\n9:30\nacquisition is that we're saying there's\n9:32\ngoing to be definitely long-term growth\n9:34\nand market expansion and that needs to\n9:37\nbe invested in. And lastly, our um debt\n9:40\nreduction is going to be uh primarily to\n9:44\nreduce risk and increase our financial\n9:47\nstability as a company. Now, we're going\n9:50\nto go into evaluating whether the\n9:52\nprogram creates value or merely\n9:54\ntransfers uh value among stakeholders.\n9:58\nKind of went over that already. Um,\n10:02\nwith the share buyback, there's um,\n10:08\nyeah, with with the with the with the\n10:10\nshare buyback, it's it's transferring\n10:12\nmoney. Uh, they're they're not they're\n10:14\nnot buying anything new. They're just\n10:17\ntaking uh\n10:19\ncash off the balance sheet and\n10:23\nuh, giving it to the shareholders who\n10:25\nsell it. It's just rearranging um where\n10:29\nthe shares are going. And same thing\n10:31\nwith dividend. It's transferring value.\n10:35\nIt's um it's transferring the value\n10:37\ndirectly into the bank accounts of the\n10:40\nshareholders. Um we're going to have\n10:44\nacquisition be our only value creation\n10:48\nas it's the only thing we're uh\n10:51\ncreating. That's the only thing we're\n10:52\nproducing which is going to be our um AI\n10:56\nand VR\n10:58\num acquisition. Now\n11:00\ngoing into the um debt redu uh deduction\n11:06\nor the debt payown that's also not\n11:08\ncreating anything new. You're just\n11:10\npaying off the debt. And\n11:14\nlastly, we're going to be looking at uh\n11:16\nthe signaling effects, market\n11:19\nperception, and long-term capital\n11:22\nallocation\n11:24\num for each option. And so for each\n11:27\noption uh if we go for our um\n11:35\nuh\n11:39\nhold on\n11:41\nthe signaling effects. Yeah. So for\n11:45\num each option we're signaling that um\n11:49\nuh with the buyback we're going to be\n11:51\nsignaling that the Apple is uh confident\n11:54\nin their company and that uh they are\n11:58\nundervalued\n12:00\nand so um buying more of their shares uh\n12:04\nwill signal to the rest of the market\n12:07\nthat uh Apple thinks their company is\n12:10\nworth a lot more than um it's currently\n12:12\npriced. that and they are going to want\n12:15\nto boost that um\n12:18\nuh the stock price because they want to\n12:21\nbuy it now while it's cheap to further\n12:24\nincrease the profits they're going to\n12:25\ngain. Uh the dividend uh signal is uh it\n12:30\nannounces that Apple is already making\n12:33\nsignificant money and that\n12:37\nthey're going to continue to make money.\n12:40\nIt doesn't really signal any um growth.\n12:43\nIt really signals a maturity point in\n12:44\nthe company. It's it's they've already\n12:47\ngenerated money. They're going to\n12:48\ncontinue to generate money. They're not\n12:49\nreally going to grow. So, they're going\n12:51\nto distribute that wealth to their\n12:53\nshareholders. and our acquisition is\n12:56\ngoing to schedule a signal that there is\n13:00\ngoing to be high growth in what they're\n13:02\nworking on and they're just going to\n13:07\num\n13:09\nbe going into something more aggressive.\n13:11\nUh they're going to be aggressively\n13:13\ncampaigning and aggressively growing for\n13:17\num to to in the AI and VR domain to\n13:22\nincrease their profits. So,\n13:27\nlet's see. Do I have anything here?\n13:30\nExtra\n13:32\num\n13:34\nthat reduction. I mean, yeah, that that\n13:36\nreduction it just reduces the risk.\n13:39\nYou're you're you're\n13:41\nsignaling that you're going to be more\n13:43\nfinancially stable. That's the whole\n13:44\npoint of the uh debt reduction. You're\n13:47\ngoing to be, you know, um responsible\n13:51\nand worthy of credit.\n13:53\nUm, it's going to emphasize long-term\n13:56\ncapital allocation. Um, they're going to\n14:00\nprioritize their financial health.\n14:02\nAcquisition is going to prioritize\n14:03\ngrowth. Dividends is and and the buyback\n14:07\nare going to um show that they're going\n14:11\nto be providing for their uh\n14:14\nshareholders. So, uh, buy back is going\n14:18\nto be the most efficient way to, um, uh,\n14:21\nin in the short run to put money in the\n14:24\npockets of their shareholders.\n14:26\num similar with dividends, but\n14:29\nultimately in the wrong long run. Um to\n14:33\nanswer the original analysis question of\n14:37\num determining whether the buyback\n14:39\ncreates value relative to the\n14:41\nalternative uses, I would say the um the\n14:46\nmost strategic use would be the\n14:48\nacquisition. It has the most value as it\n14:52\nis ah 6.75 earnings per share which is\n14:56\ngreater than all other scenarios as well\n14:59\nas the leverage ratio drops a little bit\n15:01\nwith that acquisition as well\n15:04\nand also our um ROIC\n15:10\nour um return on investment capital is\n15:13\nthe highest um in the long run they're\n15:17\ngoing to be um demonstrating the most\n15:19\ngrowth in the company. They're going to\n15:21\nbe uh demonstrating the most profit and\n15:23\nultimately that's the best option that\n15:26\nthey have right now. Um it's definitely\n15:29\nvalued more in my opinion than the\n15:31\nbuyback. And if I were to recommend an\n15:35\nalternative to the acquisition, it would\n15:37\nbe the debt reduction. just keeping\n15:40\neverything the same as is, but just\n15:43\nreducing that uh debt payown, that can\n15:48\ngo a long way. It's going to build um\n15:51\ngood company reputation as they're\n15:54\nproving financial stability and their\n15:56\ncreditworthiness. And if they need to\n15:58\ntake out more, more bond um investors\n16:01\nare going to be looking at um\n16:04\npotentially investing in Apple because\n16:05\nthey know they're good for their money.\n16:07Uh, thank you."
