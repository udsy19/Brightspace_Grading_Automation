  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Meher and this\n0:06\npresentation is a driverbased analysis\n0:08\nof Apple's hypothetical $90 $90 billion\n0:13\ncapital allocation decision.\n0:16\nSo we must evaluate a proposed share\n0:19\nbuyback against four critical\n0:21\nalternatives.\n0:22\na special dividend, a strategic\n0:25\nacquisition,\n0:27\ndepth reduction, and incremental R&D.\n0:32\nOur goal is to determine which choice\n0:36\nbest creates value while balancing\n0:38\nstakeholder incentives.\n0:44\nSo, we'll start with define and\n0:47\ndiscover, which is the first step of the\n0:50\ndriver framework.\n0:52\nThe problem is a classic capital\n0:55\nallocation decision for a cashrich firm.\n0:58\nOur key givens include an impressive\n1:03\nliquidity position of $165 billion in\n1:07\ncash and $100 billion in annual free\n1:11\ncash flow paired with $110\n1:16\nin debt\n1:19\num in total debt. And the market context\n1:22\nis $185\n1:25\nshare price with a PE of 30. And our\n1:31\nfinal financial objectives are clear. We\n1:34\nmust quantify the impact on key\n1:38\nstockholders, stakeholders,\n1:41\nmanagement, employees and shareholders\n1:43\nand compare the options using metrics\n1:46\nlike EPS, leverage and ROIC.\n1:56\nSo the next step\n1:59\nof the driver framework is R where uh\n2:03\nrepresent and we will map out our\n2:07\nanalytical plan. So we need a\n2:10\ntransparent\n2:11\nparameterized model which we built in\n2:14\nPython\n2:16\nto solve the key metrics and the\n2:20\nfinancial logic is centered on these\n2:23\nthree concepts. First value creation\n2:27\nversus value transfer. True value\n2:30\ncreation must have an MPV greater than\n2:33\nzero which typically applies to R&D or\n2:36\nacquisitions\n2:38\nwhile buybacks and dividends are merely\n2:41\ntransfers of existing value. Second\n2:44\nagency theory.\n2:46\nSo we must track how to how the buyback\n2:52\nthe through its EPS accrion specifically\n2:58\nbenefits management stock options and\n3:02\nlastly which is the third signaling\n3:05\ntheory which is a buyback for instance\n3:09\nsignals management\n3:12\nbelieves the stock is undervalued.\n3:16\nSo\n3:18\nnow we will move on to\n3:22\nthe next\n3:24\nuh\n3:26\nso these were the three key financial\n3:28\nconcepts and now we will move on to\n3:31\nimplement which\n3:34\num we used the Python model which we can\n3:39\nshow you here.\n3:42\nSo we used Gemini to help us uh create\n3:47\num this Python model structure\n3:51\nand which you can see here with clear\n3:53\nassumptions and we calculated the\n3:55\nprecise financial impact.\n3:58\nSo\n4:01\nbuyback proposal analysis\n4:04\nshows that the $90 billion $90 billion\n4:08\nwould repurchase approximately\n4:12\nX amount of million shares and\n4:17\nwhich is\n4:19\nuh 486.5\n4:22\nmillion\n4:25\nand this is immediately\n4:28\naccreative to EPS boosting it by\n4:33\nas we can see\n4:36\num by 3.24%.\n4:39\nHowever, because the company is using\n4:42\ncash without paying down debt debt, the\n4:46\ndebt to equity ratio increases\n4:52\nand uh which indicates a higher\n4:56\nfinancial risk.\n4:58\nSo now we will move on to the\n5:00\nstakeholder analysis.\n5:03\nUm, and we see here that the buyback\n5:07\nconcentrates ownership directly\n5:09\nbenefiting retail and institutional\n5:12\nshareholders and most importantly\n5:14\nmanagement whose 3 million options\n5:17\nbecomes theoretically more valuable due\n5:20\nto the higher expected share price. And\n5:24\nthen lastly, alternative comparison. And\n5:27\nas you can see here in the table, the\n5:29\ndepth reduction alternative provides the\n5:34\nlargest deleveraging effect\n5:37\nsignificantly reducing the DE ratio and\n5:41\nthe acquisition alternative offers the\n5:43\nhighest potential EPS if we assume a\n5:46\nstrong ROIC\n5:48\nof 15%.\n5:52\nWhich is a clear sign of potential value\n5:55\ncreation. But this is highly sensitive\n5:57\nto execution.\n6:02\nAnd now\n6:05\nwe will move on to\n6:09\nvalidate and evolve which is the next\n6:12\nstep of the driver uh framework. And in\n6:16\nthe validate stage we checked our\n6:19\nresults and the buybacks EPS accretion\n6:22\nis mathematically\n6:24\nmakes sense.\n6:26\nAnd the accretion is approximately equal\n6:29\nto the inverse of the PE ratio which is\n6:33\n3.3%.\n6:36\nSo for evolve we test a critical\n6:38\nassumption\n6:40\nuh which is an acquisition risk. So\n6:45\nwe use our models scenario to ask at\n6:50\nwhat minimum ROIC\n6:54\ndoes the acquisition become\n6:57\nfinancially superior. So the answer is\n7:01\nthe answer is an ROIC greater than the\n7:04\ninverse PE. So if Apple can generate an\n7:08\nROIC above 3.3% on the acquisition, it\n7:12\nis better is it a better use of capital\n7:16\nfrom a value creation standpoint.\n7:20\nSo\n7:24\na visual on the screen compares the EPS\n7:27\ngain\n7:28\nagainst the leverage shift.\n7:32\nAnd this clearly demonstrates the\n7:33\ntrade-off. The buyback offers high\n7:36\nimmediate EPS but the cost of high risk\n7:41\nhigher risk. So acquisition offers high\n7:44\npotential EPS with no leverage shift but\n7:46\nhigh execution risk and depth reduction\n7:50\noffers risk reduction with only a\n7:52\nmoderate EPS gain.\n7:58\nSo now um we will\n8:03\nmove on to the last step of the driver\n8:05\nframework which is reflect. And we\n8:08\nfinally um conclude that our analysis\n8:12\nsuggests that the $90 billion buyback\n8:15\nwhile immediately beneficial to\n8:17\nshareholders and management through EPS\n8:20\naccretion is primarily a value transfer\n8:23\nmechanism and raises agency's concerns\n8:28\ndue to the disproportionate benefit to\n8:31\nCEO's options. We recommend that a split\n8:37\ncapital allocation strategy works the\n8:39\nbest.\n8:41\nSo\n8:43\na 45 billion which is 50% uh for focus\n8:50\ndebt reduction and this significantly\n8:53\ndeleverages the balance sheet lowers\n8:55\nfinancial risk and improves bond holder\n8:58\nsecurity. and the other 50% $45 billion\n9:02\nof the $90 billion total for incremental\n9:06\nuh strategic\n9:08\nR&D\n9:10\num or an extremely focused acquisition.\n9:15\nThis is the path to a long-term value\n9:19\ncreation and it's shows capital\n9:21\ndiscipline while investing in the next\n9:24\ngeneration of growth.\n9:26\nSo this balanced approach\n9:30\num will you know be the best option\n9:35in my opinion. Thank you."
