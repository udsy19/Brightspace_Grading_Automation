  "transcript": "This is Michael Thorp and this is my session 11 assignment for management 310. And so this is the apperal corporate finance decision analysis using the driver framework. And so for the define stage, I entered my prompt uh as I was uh coordinating with Jim and I AI and I said act as a lead strategy consultant uh for a multi-billion dollar uh company. Define the core problem regarding Apple's proposed $90 billion share repurchase. And then I copy and pasted this information\n\nand that is that um there's this decision within Apple which involves a hypothetical $90 billion share repurchase and we're acting as an independent analyst who must determine whether the buyback creates value relative to alternative uses of cash while balancing stakeholder incentives. And so the capital allocation snapshot uh liquidity $165 billion cash investments $100 billion annual free cash flow. Market context there's $185 share price PE ratio of 30 uh dividend yield of.5% and 15.5 billion shares outstanding. Uh the balance sheet there's $110 billion in debt. Birkshshire owns 6% CEO CEO holds three million shares and retail investors average 100 shares and employees have $170 strike options. Uh so the proposal is the $90 billion buyback executed over one year. Um, and then the alternatives, um, we could pay a $6 special dividend, uh, a strategic AI/VR acquisition, uh, debt reduction or incremental uh, research and development. And, uh, our job is to deliver recommendation that explains stakeholder impacts, agency considerations, and value creation versus value transfer outcomes.\n\nAnd so the main action here um was we just established the core conflict determining if a $90 billion buyback at peak valuation creates or destroys value compared to alternative uses of uh cash. So the finding is that the objective is not just returning cash but maximizing long-term shareholder utility and value. And uh the main things here are just the proposed $90 billion buyback or do we want to do something alternative uh with our cash such as uh declaring a special dividend or research and development. And so for R uh my action was just to analyze Apple's current liquid liquidity which is $165 bill $165 billion. uh we had debt of $110 billion and market valuation um of $185 share price. Um and so what I found was that Apple is trading at a low earnings yield of 3.3% while cash yields are high about 5%.\n\nAnd then moving into I uh the third step uh I just identified the drivers of the decision. So uh there's exe executive incentives um versus the shareholder value which is just uh option value protection versus uh intrinsic value growth um which I helped uh Jim and I to define. And so a major driver is agency conflict. Um which means management benefits more from price support than the cash distribution. Um but we're focused on uh\n\nmaximizing the shareholder utility. And so here I generated code um and the interpretation of this code which generates uh the EPS impact analysis. So the status quo EPS is 6.17 pro- for EPS 6.13 shares retired 49 um EPS impact uh.599 verdict is dilutive and uh the value arbitrage analysis stock earnings yield 3.33 cash risk free yield 5% uh conclusion destroy value and so I'll explain what this code did um and basically it simulated the year and which we were buying back uh the 90 billion shares. It simulated that and the interpretation for our final findings um was an immediate reduction of 486 million shares uh but left the company with reduced uh payouts for potential AI acquisitions. Um and the buyback would create a price floor but remove flexibility. And so the EPS impact in this is that the code um showed that this move this buyback would be dilutive or effectively neutral. Um as I mentioned in the code it shows that it was the verdict was dilutive. Uh, and this is because the company is trading um expensive yields of 3.3% while its cash is earning a cheap risk-free return of 5%. So, we're swapping a high return asset cash for a low return asset stock when we're buying those stocks back. Um, so essentially, uh, this proposal would just maximize price. Um\nbut it risks value in the long term. Um so with the code returning to us that uh it pretty much destroys value and it's dilutive. Um my key recommendation would be maybe a split strategy in which we buy back some stock um something like 40 billion. So, a little under half of the $90 billion total that we were planning to spend and take the other $50 billion and declare a dividend."
