  "transcript": "0:02\nHi. So this is my session 11 uh project.\n0:07\nUm so the first step is to find and\n0:09\ndiscover. So here is the assignment\n0:13\noverview. So evaluate Apple's\n0:15\nhypothetical $90 million share\n0:17\nrepurchase using driver. act as an\n0:19\nindependent analyst who must determine\n0:21\nwhether the buyback creates value\n0:23\nrelative to alternative use of cash\n0:26\nwhile balancing stakeholders in\n0:28\nincentives.\n0:29\nSo here's a define discover. So this\n0:33\nstage focuses on clearly understanding\n0:35\nApple's capital allocation decision\n0:37\nconfirming financial inputs and defining\n0:39\nthe the strategic scope of the analysis.\n0:42\nThe problem. Apple's management is\n0:45\nevaluating large-scale $90 billion share\n0:47\nrepurchase program to be executed over\n0:49\nthe next year. With $165 billion in cash\n0:53\nin marketable investments and hundred\n0:55\nbillion in annual uh free cash flow,\n0:58\nApple has the liquid liquidity capacity\n1:01\nto buy back approximately 0.49 billion\n1:05\nshares at a market price of $185 per\n1:08\nshare. The decision requires deter\n1:11\ndetermining if a $90 billion buyback\n1:14\ncreates um shareholder value or whether\n1:17\nalternatives use of capital including a\n1:20\n$6 special dividend strategic AI or VR\n1:24\nacquisition debt reduction and\n1:26\nincremental R&D would generate superior\n1:29\nlong-term returns and align incentives\n1:31\nacross stakeholders. So this analysis\n1:34\nmust also incorporate incorporate the\n1:36\nimpacts of multiple stakeholder groups\n1:38\nincluding retail shareholders,\n1:40\ninstitutional um investors like\n1:42\nBirkshshire Hathaway, the CEO um\n1:45\nemployees with $100 strike options and\n1:48\nbond holders with $10 billion corporate\n1:51\ndebt exposure. So the goal is to build a\n1:54\ntransparent Python based capital\n1:56\nallocation model that quantifies the EPS\n1:59\nexoration\n2:01\nunder $90 billion buyback ownership\n2:04\nconcentration effects leverage\n2:06\nimprovements from debt reduction\n2:09\nstakeholder specific economic outcomes\n2:12\nROIC thresholds for M&A and R&D\n2:15\ninvestments and then we have to use\n2:17\nthese results to provide a\n2:18\nrecommendation on whether Apple should\n2:20\naccept modify or reject check the\n2:22\nbuyback relative to the strategic\n2:24\nalternatives. So, first we got to make\n2:27\nsure fact checked every fact check\n2:28\neverything just to make sure it's\n2:30\ncorrect and all. So, several capital\n2:32\nallocation errors can occur if inputs\n2:34\nare not validated upfront to avoid\n2:36\nimproper conclusions. The following were\n2:38\nexplicitly explicitly verified before\n2:40\nmodeling. So, the shares outsigning was\n2:43\n15.5 billion. Share price is $185.\n2:47\nImplied market cap is $2.87 87 trillion\n2:51\nand a $98 billion buyback represents\n2:54\napproximately 3.1% of market cap not\n2:56\n10%.\n2:58\nThe next thing is the assignments um\n3:00\napproximately 10% of market cap. So\n3:03\nstatement is treated as narrative\n3:05\ncontext but the model uses actual um\n3:08\nmath. So for EPS um der derivation\n3:13\num the p per p ratio is 30 eps equals to\n3:19\nprice divided by pure e equals to 6.17\n3:24\nand the net income is 6.17 * 15.5\n3:28\nbillion which gives you $95.58 billion.\n3:31\nThen you have tax treatment which is\n3:33\nbuybacks have no corporate tax\n3:35\nimplication. So dividends incur\n3:37\nimmediate shareholder tax and then debt\n3:40\nreduction increases net income through\n3:42\nafter tax interest savings. And then for\n3:45\nemployee options you have $170 uh strike\n3:48\nprice but the buyback pushes options\n3:51\nfurther in the money and this creates\n3:54\nvalue transfer and non- new value\n3:56\ncreation. So hypothesis\n3:59\ngiven Apple's high valuation is 30 and\n4:03\nstrong liquidity the $90 billion buyback\n4:06\nwill have a modest positive impact on\n4:08\nEPS and ownership concentration but the\n4:11\nEPS can increase um but the EPS increase\n4:15\nis mechanical not operational and value\n4:18\nis transferred from cash to equity\n4:20\nholders and alternatives with ROIC W um\n4:24\nROIC is greater than WAC CC, which may\n4:28\nproduce greater long-term value\n4:30\ncreation. So, this project will likely\n4:32\nbe highly influenced by agency\n4:34\nincentives, specifically management's\n4:36\nincreasing equity value and earnings\n4:38\nbase compensation tied to the EPS\n4:40\noptics. So, key questions to answer. So,\n4:44\ndoes $90 billion buyback generate a\n4:47\npositive EPS impact worth prioritizing\n4:49\nover innovation? How does a buyback\n4:52\naffect ownership concentration,\n4:53\nespecially for Birkshshire? Does the\n4:56\nbuyback destroy value when executed at a\n4:58\nhigh valuation multiple? And then how do\n5:00\nbond bond holders view the balance sheet\n5:03\nrisk shift? And would a $90 billion\n5:05\nstrategic acquisition generate an ROIC\n5:09\nabove WACC? And is a $6 special dividend\n5:13\na fairer mechanism for distributing\n5:15\nexcess capital? And lastly, what are the\n5:18\ngovernance and signaling implications of\n5:20\nthe buyback? Then we have the second\n5:23\nstage represent. So this stage outlines\n5:26\nthe analytical and technical steps used\n5:28\nto construct the model and compute the\n5:30\ncapital allocation outcomes. So for the\n5:32\ncore formula methodology, so the\n5:35\nanalysis centers on comparing the EPS\n5:37\nimpact, ownership effects and valuation\n5:40\nand value creation potential of five\n5:42\ncapital allocation choices which are\n5:45\nshare repurchase, special dividend, debt\n5:47\nreduction, strategic acquisition and\n5:50\nincremental R&D. Some key equations to\n5:54\ninclude is that EPS equals to the net\n5:56\nincome divided by shares outstanding.\n5:59\nThe shares retired equals to buyback\n6:01\ndollars divided by share price. The net\n6:03\nincome debt reduction equals to net\n6:05\nincome plus interest savings time 1\n6:08\nminus the tax rate. And the dividend per\n6:10\nshare equals to 90 billion divided by\n6:13\n15.5 billion. And so the ROIC investment\n6:18\nalso has to be greater than the WACC\n6:20\nwhich is the value creation analytical\n6:23\nprocess. So we're going to first make a\n6:26\nmodel. So we have to define all the\n6:27\ninputs in Python. Derive baselines EPS\n6:30\nand NI and validate market\n6:32\ncapitalization arithmetic.\n6:35\nThen step two which is the buyback\n6:36\nscenario. So compute shares retired.\n6:39\nCompute new shares outstanding. compute\n6:41\nnew EPS and calculate EPS accuration.\n6:45\nAnd then step three, alternative\n6:46\nscenario modeling. So special dividend\n6:48\nis $5.81 per share. No EPS change. For\n6:52\ndebt reduction, debt falls to $20\n6:55\nbillion. EPS increases to $6.37.\n6:59\nThen for acquisition, so the threshold\n7:01\nROIC\n7:03\nis greater than 8% which is the WACC.\n7:07\nAnd then R&D. So value creation depends\n7:10\non probability weighted innovation\n7:12\nreturn. And then step four which is a\n7:15\nstakeholder impact. So compare outcomes\n7:17\nfor retail shareholders, institutional\n7:20\nholders, CEO equity value, employees\n7:23\nwith $170 options and bond holders\n7:26\nholding $110 million in debt. So we went\n7:30\nto Gemini and we inputed our prompt in\n7:33\nGemini and asked it to create a code for\n7:35\nus. And so here's the code. Then we\n7:38\nimport this co code into collab. So here\n7:41\nit is. So over here the first thing that\n7:44\nit does is that it defines the\n7:46\nparameters in initial state. So it shows\n7:49\nhow cash investments is $165 billion,\n7:53\nannual free cash flow is hundred billion\n7:55\nand total debt is $110 billion. Then for\n7:58\nmarket and stock data, share price is\n8:00\n$185 per share. uh PE ratio is $30 and\n8:04\nthen shares outstanding is 15.5 billion\n8:09\nand then the buyback amount is $90\n8:11\nbillion, tax rate is 0.21 and assumed\n8:14\ndebt interest rate is 0.045 which is\n8:17\n4.5%.\n8:19\nAnd then we go to derived initial state\n8:22\nmetrics. So here gives formulas like EPS\n8:25\nis your share price divided by the PE\n8:28\nratio. your um current net income equals\n8:31\nthe current EPS times shares\n8:33\noutstanding.\n8:35\nAnd then um it gives some more formulas.\n8:38\nHow the shares retired equals to buyback\n8:40\namount divided by share price. New\n8:42\nshares outstanding equals to shares\n8:44\noutstanding minus shares retired. New\n8:46\nEPS is net income divided by new shares\n8:48\noutstanding. And then EPS increase\n8:51\npercent is your new EPS divided by the\n8:53\ncurrent EPS and take that and subtract\n8:56\nit um by one minus one. Um and then and\n9:01\nthen it gives us a some more formulas as\n9:04\nwell. So new total debt equals the total\n9:06\ndebt minus reduction amount. Then\n9:09\npre-tax savings equals reduction amount\n9:11\ntime debt rate. And then you have after\n9:13\ntax savings which is your pre-tax\n9:15\nsavings time 1 minus tax rate. Um you\n9:18\nhave your new net income which is net\n9:20\nincome plus after tax savings. And then\n9:22\nnew EPS which is new net income divided\n9:24\nby shares outstanding.\n9:27\nSo, we're going to be finding all of\n9:28\nthose things\n9:30\nand so required analysis. So, scenario\n9:33\none where you have a $90 billion share\n9:35\nbuyback. Um,\n9:38\nand it talks about stakeholder outcomes\n9:40\nlike the impacts and stuff.\n9:44\nUm then you also have um another\n9:48\ncomparison to alternatives where like\n9:50\nyou have a special dividend, alternative\n9:52\nB is debt reduction and alternative C\n9:55\nand D is strategic acquisition which or\n9:58\nM&A or R&D and then um it talks also\n10:03\ntalks about value creation versus\n10:04\ntransfer and agency implications\n10:07\nand then there's also signaling and\n10:09\nlong-term strategy and then I'll finally\n10:12\nprovide us with the final\n10:13\nrecommendation.\n10:14\nSo\n10:16\nwhen once I run this code, it provides\n10:18\nme with this\n10:20\num this output. So current Apple capital\n10:23\nallocation analysis. So current EPS is\n10:27\n$6.17.\n10:29\nCurrent net income is 95 um.58 billion.\n10:34\nOkay. For quantifying buyback outcome,\n10:36\nso buyback cost is $90 billion. Shares\n10:38\nretired is 0.49 billion. New shares\n10:41\noutstanding is 15.0. 01 billion and new\n10:45\nEPS is $6.37.\n10:47\nThen for stakeholder impact, so retail\n10:49\nand institutional shareholders, so they\n10:53\nbenefit from a 3.24 immediate boost in\n10:56\nEPS, which typically supports the stock\n10:58\nprice. And then\n11:01\nthey also share ownership concentration\n11:03\nincreases.\n11:05\nAnd then for management or employees,\n11:08\nwhich is holding options. So options um\n11:11\nbecome more valuable as the stock price\n11:13\nis likely supported by the EPS boost in\n11:16\nthe reduction in supply and the buyback\n11:18\nacts as a floor for the stock price.\n11:21\nThen third stakeholder is bond holders.\n11:24\nUm so it has a negative impact. So\n11:26\nleveraging up so using cash instead of\n11:29\npaying um down debt increases the ca the\n11:32\ncompany's financial uh risk profile and\n11:36\nthen net debt which is debt minus cash\n11:38\nbecomes less negative. signaling less\n11:40\nfinancial cushion.\n11:42\nAnd the second thing, comparison to\n11:44\ncapital allocation alternatives.\n11:46\nSo alternative A where you have $5.81\n11:50\nspecial dividend. So EPS impact is none.\n11:53\nShares outstanding remains the same. For\n11:55\nownership change, none because it's no\n11:57\nchange in float. Stakeholder view prefer\n12:00\nto buy income focused retail investors\n12:02\nless tax efficient than a buyback.\n12:05\nThen for alternative B which is a $98\n12:08\nbillion debt reduction. So new debt is\n12:10\n$20 billion which is a massive reduction\n12:14\nin leverage. And then new EPS is $6.37\n12:18\nwhich is a 3.35 increase due to the\n12:20\ninterest savings for bond holders view\n12:23\nhighly positive improves credit ratings\n12:26\nand financial stability. Lowers overall\n12:28\ncost of capital and then for strategic\n12:31\nfit. Excellent for balancing financial\n12:33\nrisk but is the least exciting use of\n12:36\ncash. Then for alternative C and D\n12:39\nacquisition or in incremental R&D. So\n12:42\nvalue creation test if the investment\n12:44\nyields an ROIC greater than 8% it\n12:48\ncreates long-term value. So buyback\n12:50\nversus R&D. Buyback is short-term EPS\n12:53\nboost. R&D is long-term high risk value\n12:56\ncreation. There are opposites on the\n12:59\nriskreward spectrum.\n13:01\nAnd then the third one is value creation\n13:04\nversus value transfer agency valuation.\n13:07\nSo value creation uh versus value\n13:10\ntransfers. So buyback um\n13:14\nprimarily of um it's primarily from the\n13:18\ncompany's balance sheet to the\n13:20\ncontinuing shareholders. Since P E is 30\n13:24\num which is high the buyback is likely\n13:27\ndone at a high valuation reducing its\n13:30\nvalue creating potential for debt\n13:33\nreduction. So there's potential for\n13:35\ngenuine um value creation if the returns\n13:38\nexceed the cost of capital for agency\n13:40\nand govern governance implications. with\n13:42\na buyback, high potential for agency\n13:45\nrisk, management benefits directly from\n13:47\nEPS linked bonuses, and lower option\n13:50\nstrike prices due to a rising stock\n13:52\nprice incentivizing a buyback even if\n13:55\nthe cash could be better spent elsewhere\n13:58\nthan acquisition or R&D. So less direct\n14:01\npersonal gain for management but still\n14:03\nstrategic benefits and for dividend low\n14:06\nagency risk and it's a direct\n14:08\ntransparent cash payment to all\n14:10\nshareholders. Then four which is\n14:12\nsignaling effects in long-term capital\n14:15\nallocations. So buyback signaling\n14:18\nsignals uh confidence that the stock is\n14:21\nundervalued and that the firm has\n14:23\nexhausted all higher returning internal\n14:25\nopportunities for dividend signaling. So\n14:28\nsignals stability and maturity. A\n14:30\nspecial dividend um signals that the\n14:32\ncash is truly excess and not needed for\n14:35\ncore operations. debt reduction\n14:37\nsignaling. So signaling signals\n14:39\nfinancial discipline, risk aversion and\n14:42\na desire to optimize the balance sheet\n14:45\nwhich is often positive for bond holders\n14:47\nand risk averse equity to holders. Then\n14:50\nR&D or acquisition signaling so signals\n14:53\na focus on future growth and product\n14:56\ninnovation. The market's reaction\n14:58\ndepends heavily on the strategic fit and\n15:00\nthe transparency of the expected return\n15:02\nmetrics. Then your final recommendation.\n15:05\nSo given Apple's massive cash uh\n15:08\nposition of $165 billion in high uh PE\n15:11\nof 30, the optimal strategy is a hybrid\n15:15\napproach. So number one, $90 billion $90\n15:20\nbillion um buyback. So proceed with a\n15:22\nsignificant buyback to satisfy\n15:24\nshareholder demand, consolidate\n15:26\nownership and realize the calculated\n15:29\n3.24% EPS increase.\n15:32\nThen balance sheet optimization. So\n15:35\ncommit $50 billion uh to substantial\n15:38\ndebt reduction program to improve bond\n15:40\nratings and financial flexibility. And\n15:42\nthird thing is future growth. So\n15:44\ndedicated material portion of the 100\n15:46\nmillion dollar annual FCF to incremental\n15:50\nR&D or acquisitions to ensure long-term\n15:53\nvalue creation and counter the\n15:55\nperception of being an exgrowth company.\n15:59\nSo that was the code and all. So we used\n16:02\nthe kiss press principle in it. Um we\n16:05\ntalked about net income, EPS, debt\n16:07\nsavings and stakeholder impacts\n16:09\nand everything. So before any action,\n16:13\nthe EPS was $6.17. Net income was $958\n16:17\nbillion.\n16:19\nFor scenario one for the $90 billion\n16:21\nshare buyback, so shares uh retired, so\n16:23\nit's 0.49 billion. New shares is 15.01\n16:27\nbillion. New EPS is $6.37.\n16:30\nand EPS increases by 3.24%.\n16:34\nThen stakeholder impact summary. So\n16:36\nretail and institutional so EPS uh goes\n16:39\nup and ownership concentration\n16:41\nincreases. Then for CEO and employees\n16:44\nthere's um options more valuable and the\n16:47\nwealth increases. Then for bond holders\n16:51\nis that the cushion decreases and\n16:53\nleverage perception increases. Now for\n16:56\nscenario comparisons. So for scenario A,\n16:58\nspecial dividend, you go from $90\n17:00\nbillion to five um which is $5.81\n17:04\nper share, no EPS change, immediate\n17:07\ntaxable distrib distribution and neutral\n17:10\ngovernor\n17:12\ngovernance risk. And then for debt\n17:15\nreduction, um debt falls from 110\n17:17\nbillion to $20 billion and net income\n17:20\nrises through interest savings. EPS\n17:22\nincreases to $6.37\n17:25\nand is positive for bond holders and\n17:27\nimproves credit profile. Then for the um\n17:32\nCNDS which is acquisition or incremental\n17:34\nR&D. So the value creation only if ROIC\n17:38\nis greater than 8% long-term strategic\n17:40\nupside and no immediate EPS boost. Then\n17:44\nfour which is validates. So we just need\n17:46\nto make sure that everything makes sense\n17:47\nand is accurate.\n17:50\nSo for EPS ex um accretion testing so\n17:55\nbuyback EPS gains are mechanical no\n17:57\nimprovement in operation no change to\n17:59\nenterprise value the result is that\n18:02\nvalue transfers um not creation\n18:05\nvaluation check um fe of 30 is the\n18:08\npremium valuation buybacks at high\n18:10\nvaluation tend to destroy value unless\n18:13\nthe future earnings growth is greater\n18:15\nthan the implied equity cost. Then you\n18:17\nhave stakeholder logic. So buyback\n18:19\nconcentrates ownership. CEO earns\n18:22\ndisproportionate benefits. Retail\n18:24\nshareholders see price support but no\n18:27\ncash. Employees with options gain\n18:29\nsignificant upside. Bond holders lose\n18:32\nrisk cushion. And then for debt\n18:34\nproduction comparison, EPS increase from\n18:37\nafter tax savings. This is actual value\n18:40\ncreation improves credit metrics and no\n18:43\nagency distortion. Then for strategic\n18:46\nROI validation. So acquisition or R&D\n18:50\npotentially creates long-term enterprise\n18:52\nvalue um requires strict ROIC discipline\n18:55\nand clear strategic fit. Then for stage\n18:58\nfive which is evolve. So technical\n19:01\ncritique. So model is single period and\n19:03\nthere's no forward projection. Buyback\n19:06\nprice assume constant and 100 at $185.\n19:10\nThere's no multiple contraction or\n19:12\nexpansion analysis. No dilution modeling\n19:15\nfor option exercise. non probability\n19:17\ndistribution for M&A and R&D ROIC.\n19:21\nThen for the analytical critique, so\n19:23\nbuybacks at peak valuation expose\n19:25\nshareholders to risk. Agency incentives\n19:28\nare under quant quantified. Dividend\n19:31\ntaxation depends on shareholder type.\n19:33\nStrategic investment potential is not\n19:35\nfully modeled. And so for the next step,\n19:38\nso add a three-year forecast for the net\n19:40\nincome and EPS. May build a scenario\n19:43\nengine for different buyback prices.\n19:45\nimplement Carlo for ROIC\n19:49\nmodel option dilution and then the run\n19:53\nthe weighted average capital cost\n19:54\nsensitivity and cost of capital uh CHS\n19:59\nand then six would just reflect or key\n20:02\ntakeaways. So the executive\n20:05\nrecommendation, so the recommendation is\n20:07\nto modify. So Apple should pursue a\n20:11\nbalanced capital allocation strategy\n20:13\nrather than the full $90 billion\n20:15\none-year repurchase. So the analysis\n20:17\nshows buyback delivers $3.24% EPS lift,\n20:20\nbut via value transfer.\n20:24\nDebt reduction produces EPS gain and\n20:26\nreal value creation. strategic\n20:28\ninvestments like likely deliver ROIC\n20:31\ngreater than 8% in emerging in emerging\n20:34\nplatforms. So therefore the recommended\n20:37\nallocation is number one $45 billion\n20:40\nbuyback so you satisfy the shareholder\n20:42\nexpectations you improve the EPS optics\n20:45\nand avoid overpaying at a full scale.\n20:47\nThe second recommendation is the $50\n20:49\nbillion debt reduction. So you would\n20:53\nincrease NOPAT through interest savings,\n20:56\nimprove bond holder position and\n20:58\npreserve AAA grade risk perception. Or a\n21:02\nthird one is to use annual FCF for R&D.\n21:05\nSo from that you'll pursue high ROIC\n21:07\ninnovation, strengthen comp competitive\n21:10\nmodes and long-term value creation. So\n21:14\nsome key takeaways for management is\n21:16\nthat EVS um I creation is not value\n21:19\ncreation. So buybacks only redistribute\n21:21\nwealth without improving operations. The\n21:24\nsecond takeaway is that debt reduction\n21:26\nproduces real value. So it improves net\n21:29\nincome through interest savings and it\n21:31\nstrengthens financial f flexibility.\n21:34\nThird one is strategic investment\n21:35\nmatters. So Apple's mode depends on\n21:37\ninnovation cycles and not the share\n21:39\ncount. The fourth one is manage agency\n21:42\nrisk. So large buybacks at premium\n21:45\nvaluation reward insiders\n21:47\ndisproportionately. and then signal\n21:50\ndiscipline. So a hybrid approach signals\n21:52\nconfidence and responsibility. So that\n21:55\nis my session 11 assignment."
