  "transcript": "0:00\nHello, welcome to session 11 for\n0:02\nmanagement 310. And in this session,\n0:05\nwe're going to be evaluating whether\n0:07\nApple's proposed 90 billion share\n0:09\nrepurchase creates long-term value\n0:12\ncompared to other capital options like\n0:14\nspecial dividends, AI, VR acquisition as\n0:18\nwell as debt reduction or increase R&D.\n0:22\nThe key focuses here is to quantify the\n0:26\num earnings per share, leverage and uh\n0:29\nthe return on invested capital as well.\n0:33\nUm and so some of our we also want to\n0:36\nanalyze stakeholder outcomes and so the\n0:39\nstakeholders here would be retail\n0:40\ninvestors, institutions, management,\n0:44\nemployees as well as bond holders as\n0:46\nwell.\n0:47\nAnd then finally we want to identify\n0:49\nvalue creation versus value transfer and\n0:53\nleak results to agency and signaling\n0:56\ntheory.\n0:58\nSo some of our core definitions here\n1:00\nthat we're going to define is value\n1:02\ncreation which is refers to the\n1:04\nperceived benefit that a company\n1:05\nproducts produce products or services\n1:09\nprovide to its customer. Um and so this\n1:12\nis just the core um of the company.\n1:16\nhow it actually helps the customers and\n1:18\nthen value transfer on the other side\n1:21\nmoves existing wealth from one person or\n1:23\ngroup to another without increasing\n1:25\ntotal value. So this is just a transfer\n1:27\nof income from one person to another\n1:30\nmaybe through the company or through one\n1:32\ncompany to another company and then buy\n1:35\nback basically reduces share count with\n1:38\nhigher earnings per share without real\n1:40\ngrowth. Dividend is just direct cash\n1:43\npayout. So this is to you pay dividends\n1:46\nout to shareholders. Um so the ownership\n1:48\nis unchanged and then debt reduction\n1:51\nlowers risk and interest costs and it\n1:53\nalso lowers the whack. Acquisition\n1:56\nbasically just invests in new growth\n1:58\nassets. So the success depends on ROIC\n2:03\nbeing greater than whack. And then the\n2:05\nRN R R&D increase which we were talking\n2:08\nabout here\n2:10\num boosts innovation and long-term cash\n2:13\nflow growth as well. Um, and here's a\n2:16\nfinancial snapshot based on um\n2:21\nthe\n2:26\nfinancial or\n2:29\nwhere is it?\n2:34\nOh yeah, here. So the capital allocation\n2:36\nsnapshot. So it gives liquidity, market\n2:38\ncontext, balance sheet, proposal as well\n2:40\nas alternatives. Um, and so I just put\n2:43\nthat into a snapshot here. As you can\n2:45\nsee, the cash investments is at 165\n2:48\nbillion. The free cash flow is at 100\n2:51\nbillion per year. So this is every year.\n2:54\nThe debt is at 110 billion. Shares\n2:57\noutstanding is at 15.5 billion. And then\n3:01\nthe buyback proposal, which is what\n3:03\nwe're taking consideration here, is 90\n3:05\nbillion, which is also 10% of the market\n3:08\ncap.\n3:10\nSo our next step in our driver framework\n3:12\nis to represent. And so here are the\n3:14\nformulas that we used uh like we were\n3:16\ntalking about before earnings per share.\n3:19\nIt's just net income subtracted by\n3:21\npreferred dividends over the weighted\n3:24\naverage number of shares outstanding.\n3:26\nAnd then we also use the leverage ratio\n3:28\nformula which is total debt over total\n3:30\nequity which is pretty easy to remember.\n3:33\nAnd then finally we use return on\n3:34\ninvestment\n3:36\nwhich is ROIC is NOAT which means net\n3:39\noperating profit after tax over average\n3:43\ninvested capital. Um and so our plan\n3:46\nhere is to have 90 billion of cash use\n3:51\nand then the option toggles will be the\n3:53\nbuyback uh dividend acquisition debt and\n3:56\nthen R&D. Um, and so you'll see in our\n4:00\nspreadsheet that we created, you can\n4:01\ntoggle and it changes the result based\n4:04\non the input. And then the automatic\n4:07\noutputs is the EPS, leverage, ownership,\n4:10\nand ROIC like we were talking about\n4:11\nearlier. And then finally, we want to\n4:13\ncreate a graph, a bar graph showing the\n4:16\nEPS change per option and leverage it\n4:19\njust to give um if you're showing this\n4:22\nin like a presentation or something, it\n4:23\ngives the person looking at it a clear\n4:26\nvision of what is actually going on\n4:28\ninstead of just showing them the\n4:29\nnumbers. Um, and so I built an\n4:32\ninteractive capital allocation model in\n4:34\nGoogle Sheets to test how Apple's 90\n4:36\nbillion of cash could be used across the\n4:38\nfive different options.\n4:41\nUm, and here are some of the\n4:42\nscreenshots. Uh, that's the bar graph I\n4:44\ncreated. And I can actually go into it\n4:47\nhere to show you um that it's\n4:50\ninteractive. So, I started by entering\n4:52\nmy key financial inputs, which is share\n4:54\nprice, total shares, outstanding, net\n4:56\nincome, debt, and tax rate. As you can\n4:59\nsee under the labels here and each time\n5:02\nI switch the drop down the spreadsheet\n5:04\nautomatically recalculates how much that\n5:07\ndecision affects Apple's financials. For\n5:10\ninstance, if I choose buyback, which\n5:13\nit's already on, I repurchase about 486\n5:17\nmillion shares. Uh, which reduces the\n5:19\ntotal share count and raises EPS to\n5:22\nabout 6.808.\n5:25\nBunch of whole numbers. it keeps going\n5:27\nbut you get the idea. Um so if I switch\n5:31\nto debt reduction here\n5:34\nuh it lowers the interest expense and\n5:36\nslightly improves earnings to about\n5:38\n6.523\n5:41\nit keeps going but you can see that it\n5:43\nactually increased um based on the 10%\n5:47\nreturn on invested capital uh which\n5:49\nshows it produces the highest EPS\n5:52\num\n5:54\nhere or if you go to acquisition you can\n5:59\n6.85.\n6:01\nUm, which is the highest earnings per\n6:04\nshare out of all of them. Uh, which is\n6:07\npretty cool as well. Um, so all these\n6:09\ncalculations are completely formula\n6:11\ndriven as you can see at the top or if I\n6:15\nclick on them. Um, I guess you can't see\n6:18\nthe formulas here, but Oh, here you go.\n6:21\nSo, yeah, I can those are all the\n6:24\nformulas I added. Um, and then I also\n6:28\ncreated a table here at the bottom which\n6:30\nbasically just summarizes the EPS's\n6:32\nacross all five different scenarios.\n6:34\nUm, and you can see I highlighted the\n6:38\nbuyback in blue just to differentiate\n6:40\nit. Um, and I filled it by switching the\n6:44\ndrop down and capturing the EPS output.\n6:46\nAnd then you can see it's visualized\n6:48\nhere. Uh, basically this chart makes the\n6:50\ntrade-offs easy to see. uh and the\n6:53\nacquisations create the highest per\n6:54\nshare earnings. Debt reduction adds\n6:56\nmoderate value. Buyback mainly boosts\n7:00\nEPS through share reduction not through\n7:02\nreal operational gains. And then\n7:04\ndividends and R&D are similar because\n7:06\nthey show no uh short-term EPS\n7:09\nimprovement. However, they may drive\n7:12\nlong-term strategic benefits. So\n7:14\noverall, this model provides a\n7:16\ntransparent and reproducible way to test\n7:18\nhow Apple's $900 billion decision uh\n7:22\naffects different stakeholders in the\n7:23\nfinancial markets as well.\n7:27\nAnd so our next step of the driver\n7:29\nframework is to validate. So I made sure\n7:31\nevery formula and scenario in my model\n7:33\nworked correctly. When I switched the\n7:35\ndrop down to debt reduction, the total\n7:38\nuh debt dropped by 90 billion. So I knew\n7:40\nthat it was working and expense also\n7:44\nfell by 4.5 billion exactly as I\n7:47\nexpected. So the buyback scenario here\n7:49\nactually reduces shares by about 3% and\n7:52\nalso raised EPS while the acquisition on\n7:55\nthe other hand added 9 billion in new\n7:57\nincome giving it the highest EPS overall\n8:00\nthat we saw. Um, and I also validated it\n8:03\nby showing that all calculations were\n8:05\nupdated as I changed the assumptions and\n8:08\nthere were no errors in my calculations\n8:10\nas well. And the results also followed\n8:12\nthe financial logic and theory which was\n8:14\nthe formulas that I used instead of just\n8:16\ntyping the numbers. I made sure that\n8:18\nthey were all backed by formulas\n8:21\nand it only rose our profits only\n8:24\nincreased or shares decreased when the\n8:26\nEPA EPS changed. Um, our next step of\n8:29\nour driver framework is to evolve. So to\n8:31\nevolve this model, I made it flexible.\n8:34\nSo I can test different conditions. For\n8:36\ninstance, I can change the P and E\n8:38\nmultiple, the tax rate or the\n8:40\nacquisition return and instantly can see\n8:43\nthe impact on the EPS and leverage uh\n8:45\nimmediately. So it's also easy to scale\n8:49\nbuyback size or interest to run quick\n8:51\nsensitive tests as well. And future\n8:54\nupdates could include multi-layer\n8:55\neffects, R&D payoffs, or shared price\n8:58\nreactions as well. Uh so this just keeps\n9:00\nthe model useful in ongoing decision\n9:02\nanalysis. Um and you can even add on to\n9:06\nthis if you wanted to to keep going for\n9:08\nthe evolve stage. Finally to reflect. So\n9:11\nthrough this project I realized how\n9:13\nfinancial modeling connects to real\n9:15\nstockholder value. Buybacks mainly\n9:18\ntransfer value. Um,\n9:24\nI also can see that buybacks mainly\n9:26\ntransfer value by reducing shares while\n9:29\nacquisitions and debt reductions\n9:31\nactually create new value through higher\n9:33\nearnings or lower costs. So, I learned\n9:36\nhow small rates or ROI changes can be\n9:38\nmeaningful shifts out outcomes and gain\n9:40\nconfidence explaining how capital\n9:42\nallocation choices affect shareholders,\n9:44\nemployers, and bond holders. Overall,\n9:47\nthis project took me around 3 hours and\n9:50\nI think it helped me tie together the\n9:52\ntheory, Excel modeling and real world\n9:55\nfinance decision in a clear driven data\n9:57driven way. Thank you for listening."
