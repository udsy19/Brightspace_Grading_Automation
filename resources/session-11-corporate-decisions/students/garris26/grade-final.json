  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly covers the primary groups (shareholders, management, bondholders) and also notes employees, satisfying completeness at an introductory level. Their DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages consistently reference stakeholder impacts, meeting the moderate standard for conceptual coverage.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes concrete implementation steps (spreadsheet formulas, inputs, interactive toggles) and specific numeric results tied to those operations, plus explicit validation checks (e.g., debt dropping by $90B, expense falling by $4.5B). This demonstrates executed and validated analysis at an introductory level, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student automated scenario comparisons via dropdown toggles with formula-driven recalculation across buyback, dividend, acquisition, debt, and R&D, eliminating manual re-computation. They also exposed reusable parameters (P/E, tax rate, acquisition return) to flex assumptions. Depth and specific examples across multiple options meet a thorough, PASS-level standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies that higher debt increases financial risk (via “debt reduction lowers risk”) but does not identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate standard, this shows a basic, incomplete grasp of the capital structure trade-off, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify who gains or loses under each capital option across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, and large holders, nor does it explain divergent incentives. It also lacks any discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks. While the student mentions stakeholders and “value transfer,” the treatment is generic and not aligned to agency conflicts.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct, basic understanding that financing choices affect risk (debt reduction lowers risk/interest) and return (EPS changes), and they model leverage explicitly. However, they do not clearly explain that leverage amplifies both returns and risks, nor do they note debt’s fixed obligations raising default risk.
