  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly shows the student performed Define & Discover up front—stating the problem, stakeholders, and objectives—then proceeded to represent and implement a model. The D-stage is not post-hoc or missing, so the strict requirement is satisfied.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described scenarios and a representational logic prior to coding and then implemented a toy model that follows that plan (same business, varying financing) to produce ROE outcomes. While the representation is simple and not exhaustive on data needs, it meets the moderate standard for systematic planning and linkage to implemented artifacts.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, traceable implementation (small Python model) that directly follows their Represent plan and includes validation that outputs match theory. The approach is simple but systematic and includes intermediate checks, meeting the moderate standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies that debt raises financial risk and potential distress, demonstrated conceptually and via the implementation example. However, they never mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate standard, this shows correct but incomplete coverage of the trade-off, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies who benefits/loses under leverage and explains incentive divergence between shareholders and bondholders, with a concrete example. However, they omit employees and large holders, and do not address asset substitution/risk-shifting or buyback dynamics. Thus, understanding is sound but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains that leverage amplifies returns and risk and notes fixed interest raising distress risk, supported by an implementation example. However, the treatment lacks depth (no quantitative outputs or multiple scenarios such as a bad EBIT case), so it shows solid understanding but not thorough coverage required for PASS.",
