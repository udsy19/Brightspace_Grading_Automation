  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital-structure factors (cash surplus, leverage, financial flexibility) and compares alternatives, showing conceptual accuracy. They provide a clear directional recommendation (buyback, with conditions) supported by these factors. DRIVER stages (Implement, Validate, Reflect) substantively support the analysis and conclusion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student addresses all primary groups (shareholders, management, bondholders/lenders) and also discusses employees with options, with scenario-based implications. They integrate stakeholder effects into the modeling (ownership, leverage) and interpret impacts in Reflection, showing a comprehensive, conceptually sound coverage appropriate for this criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly reports building and running a Python Colab notebook (with referenced cells), shows model logic (functions) and describes concrete validation checks and matching outputs (share reduction, EPS patterns). These elements constitute clear, introductory-level evidence of executed and validated code, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions leverage and flexibility with debt reduction, indicating some awareness of risk, but never identifies the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield) nor explicitly connects debt to financial distress costs. Given the criterion requires recognizing the balance between tax benefits and financial risk, the omission of the tax shield leads to a FAIL under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies stakeholders and notes some divergent incentives (management equity incentives, Berkshire concentration, limited benefit to optioned employees) and touches on leverage under alternatives. However, they do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting between shareholders and bondholders, nor clearly map gains/losses for bondholders across scenarios. The treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows basic understanding that financing choices affect returns (EPS) and touches on risk via “long-term flexibility,” and they explicitly model and compare leverage. However, they do not explain that leverage amplifies both gains and losses nor note that debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. Thus, coverage is correct but not thorough, warranting PARTIAL.",
