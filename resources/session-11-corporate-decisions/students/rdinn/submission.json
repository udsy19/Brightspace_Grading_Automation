  "transcript": "Hey guys. Um, in this video I'm going to be walking through my driver analysis of Apple's proposed 90 uh billion dollar share repurchase. Um, so I built a full Python model in uh Google Collab using the help of uh Google Gemini Pro. Um, and it lets me toggle between the buyback and the four main alternatives a special divided and accus uh acquisition uh debt reduction and R&D expansion. Um, so today I'm going to walk through uh the driver framework and I'm going to reference the exact collab cells I'm using so it's super clear how the analysis developed. Um so the first um stage is define. Um, so starting with the defined stage, the the core decision I'm analyzing is whether Apple's $90 billion buyback actually creates value for shareholders and other stockholders or if it just transfers value around. Uh the key stakeholders I'll be evaluating are retail shareholders, uh institutional investors, Birkshshire since they own uh a little bit less than 6%. Employees with options management and bond holders. Uh the assignment also um asked me to compare this buyback against our al or alternative uses of the same $90 billion uh a $6 dividend uh strategic acquisition paying down debt or boosting R&D. Um so in cell one I'll all all I do is set up um the environment so I can model all this cleanly. Um so yeah and and then in cell two um for for the for the discover stage um I gathered um and and hardcoded all these all the facts from the assignments um Apple's cash flows um investment free cash flow share price um PE uh share outstanding expenses current debt level CEO and employee option info market cap from the provided price times shares. Um so you can see all that in cell two where everything is um parametricized so I can change uh scenarios um easily. So for cell three um I moved into the represent stage. Um this is where I map out how the calculations will actually work. Um so I created functions for share count changes. Um after after the buyback EPS under each scenario, ownership um concent concentration uh shifts, leverage changes, uh stock stakeholders specific outcomes, um you know like uh option value for employees. Um so all of those functions live inside cell 3 and this is really the core of the model. This is the basically the BR blueprint, not the uh not running anything yet, just preparing the logic. Um but then in in cell four, uh that's the implement stage. Um so I actually run the model for each of the five scenarios. In cell four, you'll see the outputs for um uh baseline, buyback, special dividend, accusation, um debt reduction, R&D, investment. This lets me directly compare EPS, leverage, share count, ownership, shifts, uh everything needed to analyze the capital allocation, trade offs. Um and then V for validate. Um so until five, I added some sanity checks in. Um I verify things like the the buyback um which reduces shares by around 10%. Um EPS moves in the right direction. um debt reduction uh changes leverage correct correctly uh stakeholder effects make sense. This is where I make sure the model isn't lying to me or or doing something weird under the the hood. Um and then for evolve I use cell six. So the evolve stage is where I refine the output to make the story cleaner um or clearer. Um in cell six I generated a visualization comparing um EPS under the buyback versus the alternatives. This makes it obvious that uh EPS jumps around the buyback stays flat um under R and D in dividend um drops slightly with the accusation accusation um improves modestly with debt reduction. Um it's a clean way to communicate the the trade-offs to executives. Um so yeah and then in cell 7 uh for reflect I look back at the full story in cell 7 I print a summary table comparing all five scenarios um um across EPS uh leverage and um ownership and stakeholder outcomes. Um so here's the the highlevel takeaway I ended up with. um buyback uh pros the biggest um EPS lift uh helps buyback pros also um helps long-term holders like Birkshshire um it increases ownership concentration um signals confidence and no interrogation risk um but the buyback cons um uh it doesn't create fundamental value it mostly shifts it and it doesn't help employees with options because the strike price is below the market. It also raises agency questions. Management with equity incentives uh benefits directly. Um but some alternatives is debt reduction. Uh it increases long-term flexibility and slightly boosts EPS. Uh R&D increase, highest longterm strategic value but no short-term EPS win. And then uh dividend is another alternative. Neutral for value creation. It's basically a cash transfer. And then acquisition is another alternative. Uh potentially high upside but also the riskiest. Um yeah, my final recommendation, I would recommend the buyback only if Apple simulated increases um transparency about R&D discipline to the counteract agency concerns. The buyback does help shareholders, but not because it creates new value. It's because Apple has more cash than it can productively deploy right now. Um, yeah, combining the buyback plus an R&D accountability structure uh balances short-term EPS strength with long-term innovation discipline. Um, yeah, I mean that that wraps up the the driver walkthrough. Um, the Collab notebook shows every step exactly as the framework requires. Um, and the video ties each stage back to the the code. So, it's clear how the analysis developed in real time. Um, yeah, that's all for this video. Uh, thank you guys for watching."
