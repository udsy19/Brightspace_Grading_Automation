  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly connects the buyback to management incentives via option value and CEO equity, and contrasts this with dividends, showing how stock-price-linked compensation biases choices. They also identify the agency conflict and propose a governance remedy (shift to ROIC metrics). The treatment is detailed and applied across alternatives, meeting PASS standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the problem, objectives, and alternatives early and documents stakeholder incentives before describing model implementation. Transcript shows Discover content up front and stakeholder capture prior to the implementation step, satisfying the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student articulated alternatives, the modeling logic (e.g., buyback mechanics, EPS effects, assumed 10% ROIC for acquisition) and key data inputs, then linked that plan to implemented code and scenario runs. The approach is systematic enough for a moderate standard: clear plan plus demonstrated execution.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never identifies the interest tax shield from debt nor discusses how debt increases financial risk or distress costs. While they mention Apple’s debt level and tax effects of dividends, they do not connect debt to tax benefits or risk, so the capital structure trade-off is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies incentive divergence between management/employee option holders and other shareholders and notes tax impacts, showing agency conflict awareness. However, they do not analyze bondholder effects or discuss asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks, and do not comprehensively map who gains/loses under each option. Depth gaps preclude a PASS, but the conceptual treatment merits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: While the student notes EPS can rise with a buyback, they do not explain how financial leverage amplifies both returns and risks, nor do they discuss that debt increases fixed interest obligations and default risk. Despite acknowledging Apple’s $110B debt, there’s no analysis of leverage risk; focus remains on EPS and option incentives. Under the moderate standard, this remains insufficient for the leverage effects criterion.",
