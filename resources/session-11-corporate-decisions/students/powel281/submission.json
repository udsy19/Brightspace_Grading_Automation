  "transcript": "0:02\nSo this is my uh session 11 assignment\n0:04\nfor 310 for the week and get right into\n0:07\nit by stating the objective scoping\n0:09\nhorizon constraints and furthermore. So\n0:11\nour objective is to determine whether 90\n0:13\nbillion share repurchase program is the\n0:15\noptimal capital allocation strategy for\n0:18\nApple relative to alternative uses of\n0:21\ncash. Um the goal is to recommend a\n0:24\ncourse of action that maximizes\n0:26\nshareholder value while aligning the\n0:28\nconflicting incentives of management\n0:30\nemployees and institutional investors.\n0:32\nSo for scope and horizon we have the\n0:34\nunit of analysis which is Apple our time\n0:36\nframe and our audience uh which is the\n0:39\nboard of directors and shareholders. Now\n0:42\nsome constraints are the financial\n0:44\ncapital is that it's strictly limited to\n0:46\n90 billion. uh regulatory, legal um\n0:49\nthat's like strategic acquisitions um\n0:51\nface high antirust scrutiny\n0:54\noperational and stakeholder policy which\n0:56\nthe policy must not alienate long-term\n0:59\ninstitutional holders uh or D\n1:01\nincentivize employees holding options.\n1:04\nThen you have your data inventory uh\n1:06\nwhat we have uh high confidence uh\n1:09\nmarket data share price of $185 with\n1:13\n15.5 billion shares outstanding. Our\n1:16\nbalance sheet is 165 billion uh debt is\n1:20\n110 billion with free cash flow 100\n1:22\nbillion a year. Um and then our\n1:25\nshareholder data um\n1:28\noptional option strike price is $170\n1:31\nmajor ownership stakes uh Birkshshire at\n1:34\n6%. And what do we need? Uh the interest\n1:37\nrates return on cash tax rate um in that\n1:41\nM&A ROI.\n1:44\nThen we have our success metric uh the\n1:46\nprimary metric EPS etc. Um why uh in a\n1:51\nmature company like Apple EPS grows\n1:53\ngrowth derived stock price appreciation.\n1:56\nIf the buyback increases EPS more than\n1:59\nthe opportunity cost of cash it creates\n2:01\nimmediate mathematical value. Um\n2:04\nsecondary metric uh the stakeholder\n2:07\nalignment or um why of financial wind\n2:10\nanor employees or the CEO is a strategic\n2:14\nfailure. And then you have your\n2:15\nbenchmark sanity check um which is the\n2:18\ndo nothing baseline which we will\n2:21\ncompare the b buyback results against\n2:23\ncurrent state and also you have your\n2:25\ndividend alternative uh and that's\n2:27\nsomething I'll uh cross check uh with\n2:29\nthe buyback against a $6 special special\n2:32\nshare but um that is where we kind of\n2:35\nget now into the driver framework which\n2:38\nis define and discover. Um, so what I\n2:41\ntyped into Geminine was act as an\n2:44\nindependent analyst. We must determine\n2:46\nwhether the buyback creates value\n2:47\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\n2:50\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\n2:52\nAnd again, that's kind of what I typed\n2:53\ninto Gemini to start it off. Um, this is\n2:57\nwhere I kind of began. Um and then kind\n3:01\nof uh goal is the to deliver a\n3:04\nrecommendation, explain stakeholder\n3:06\nimpacts, agency considerations and value\n3:09\ncreation versus value transferred\n3:10\noutcomes and clearly define the\n3:13\nfinancial parameters identifying B base\n3:15\ncase um versus the alternatives and\n3:18\ndiscover the hidden conflicts between\n3:19\nstakeholders that model needs to\n3:21\nsurvive. Um and now that is where we\n3:24\nbegin to represent uh translate the\n3:26\nabstract conflicts and data into like\n3:30\nstructured logical frameworks and visual\n3:32\nvisualization plans and that's kind of\n3:34\nwhat I have. So right now I have\n3:35\nstakeholders with a buyback option 90\n3:38\nbillion uh special dividend and\n3:40\nacquisition uh with your brickshshire uh\n3:43\nemployees and then management. I'll go\n3:46\nthrough it pretty quickly. Um as you see\n3:48\nfor option A the retail investors was\n3:51\nmore neutally mixed um kind of\n3:53\nincreasing ownership slightly um where\n3:56\nthere's no immediate cash where uh for B\n4:01\noption B is a high utility immediate\n4:03\ncash payout $6 a share and those taxes\n4:06\nare triggered immediately. You have your\n4:08\noption C which is the acquisition which\n4:10\nis a low utility um furthermore that\n4:13\nhigh execution risk uh creates\n4:15\nuncertainty in the short term.\n4:18\nUm and then we got got Birkshshire which\n4:20\nis a positive buyback um because the\n4:23\nownership rises for your special\n4:25\ndividend. You're more of a neutral phase\n4:27\nbecause you're facing a massive tax bill\n4:30\num on the dividend income uh that kind\n4:33\nof prevents compounding. And then option\n4:35\nC is more of a negative uh op uh option\n4:39\nfor Birkshshire. And then an employes\n4:41\nperspectives, this would be a very\n4:43\npositive for the buyback option because\n4:45\nit reduces the amount of shares\n4:47\noutstanding prices uh that rise above\n4:50\n$185. Um and this increases the value of\n4:53\n$170 strike options. Um for option B it\n4:56\nwould be more of a negative and then\n4:58\noption C would be more of a mixed a\n5:00\nhigh-risk uh option because if integ\n5:04\nintegrated uh fails the stock drops\n5:07\nmaking options worthless\n5:09\num and then you have your management CEO\n5:12\nuh again uh as we see with the buyback\n5:14\nit's pretty positive because it\n5:15\nincreases your EPS and there's a low\n5:18\nexecution risk and that's where we get\n5:20\ninto the uh option B special dividend\n5:24\nfor the management is it's more neutral,\n5:26\ndoes not really improve EPS metrics at\n5:28\nall. Um, and then for the option C, it\n5:32\nactually is a high risk reward. Um,\n5:35\nthere's high potential for failure, but\n5:36\nalso massive go if it's successful.\n5:40\nUm, but there's also a couple more ways\n5:42\nto represent this, and that is kind of\n5:44\nthe value creation versus transfer. Um,\n5:46\nand for value creation, that kind of\n5:48\nonly occurs if the ROI of the decision\n5:50\nis greater than the weighted average\n5:52\ncost of capital. um of it and then your\n5:55\nvalue transfers at the buybacks and\n5:57\ndividends are financing decisions not\n6:00\nyour operational ones. So they transfer\n6:02\nvalue um so if\n6:06\nuh buyback price is less than\n6:08\ninteresting you uh the value is\n6:11\ntransferred and if it's greater than um\n6:15\nthe value is transferred from remaining\n6:16\nshareholders to existing shareholders\n6:18\nwhich is more of a destructive more of a\n6:21\ndestructive path. Um but there's also uh\n6:24\nfinally the last representation will be\n6:26\nthe repurchase formula which is your new\n6:28\nshare account um equals your old share\n6:31\naccount minus cash used divided by your\n6:34\nrepurchase price. So now uh I'll get\n6:37\ninto my implement. Now uh this is just a\n6:39\nbrief thing in my code but this is how I\n6:42\nkind of did everything. Um I'll just\n6:45\nkind make sure it works. Uh but as I go\n6:47\nkind of had to define I had my share\n6:49\nprice of the $185 with the 15.5 billion\n6:53\nuh shares outstanding with the PE ratio.\n6:56\nUm and then I also included the total\n6:58\ncash debt proposed buyback and all the\n7:01\nother extra stuff. And so then now this\n7:02\nis where we get to the represent and\n7:04\nimplement part which is calculating that\n7:06\nbase case. So that is your share price\n7:08\ndivided by your PE ratio for the current\n7:10\nEPS. And we also have our current net\n7:13\nincome uh which is our current EPS from\n7:17\nthe formula above. U we multiply by the\n7:19\nshares outstanding that we had was was\n7:21\n15.5 billion. Um and then we were to use\n7:26\nour find our market cap again. That's\n7:28\nthe price times the shares. We kind of\n7:30\nuse that to uh the share price times the\n7:33\nshares outstanding.\n7:35\nAnd that's kind of where I'll get more\n7:37\ninto step B. Calculate the first\n7:38\nscenario, which is share uh repurchase.\n7:41\nSo that is uh shares retired equals cash\n7:44\nused by share price. Uh it's kind of\n7:47\nwhat I just went over where the new\n7:48\nshares um equal shares outstanding minus\n7:51\nthe shares uh repurchased, right? Uh\n7:54\nright here, the new share count from the\n7:56\nmathematical representation for one\n7:58\noption. Uh you have an opportunity cost\n8:00\noption uh which is right here. Uh you\n8:03\ncan look at new I had also calculate new\n8:05\nnet income EPS\n8:07\num which was just your current net\n8:09\nincome minus your the interest that you\n8:11\nlost. Um and then I kind of used that to\n8:14\nfind the new net income buyback to\n8:16\ndivided by the new shares account\n8:18\nbuyback which is kind of what we're\n8:20\nlooking for within this uh whole\n8:21\nassignment for the new EPS buyback. And\n8:24\nyes, you have your accreation buyback um\n8:27\nwhich I won't go into a lot of detail\n8:29\nbecause that uh was just a separate\n8:31\nformula that had to calculate for me. Um\n8:33\nbut you also have your other scenario\n8:35\nthe special dividend um with the share\n8:38\naccount stays the same. your new UPS\n8:40\nestablishing uh calculation and those\n8:43\nwere all the uh different ways or the\n8:47\ndifferent scenarios kind of going back\n8:48\nto this chart with the calculations just\n8:51\nkind of showing what each thing would\n8:52\nhave um but now we'll kind of get into\n8:56\nvalidate part uh kind of in ensuring\n8:59\nanalysis captures all relevant\n9:02\nstakeholder considerations and political\n9:04\nconstraints uh cross-check financial\n9:07\nimpacts with behavioral incentives\n9:09\nSo, I kind of left this in Gemini cuz uh\n9:12\nI had it reword kind of what I was\n9:14\nsaying. So, it'll be better kind of was\n9:16\nwhen I was presenting it. So, um let me\n9:19\njust get to that part real quick. Um\n9:23\nthat should be\n9:35\nso right here. Um\n9:39\nfinancial impact\n9:43\nyeah right here. So our first one is uh\n9:47\nfinancial impact verification do\n9:49\ncalculations correctly show stakeholder\n9:50\nwealth effects and kind of having it\n9:54\nreward and kind of give it a little bit\n9:56\nmore detail. um kind of needed to do the\n9:59\nPython check of the kind of going behind\n10:01\nthe final theory which is the buyback\n10:04\neffect and uh kind of what it said was\n10:06\nthat our code was showing the EPS was\n10:09\nincreasing and that our math was correct\n10:11\nbecause it had the correct PE ratio with\n10:13\nthe implying the earning ratio um and\n10:17\nkind of telling us that the EPS might\n10:19\nmust go up. Um, and then kind of for\n10:22\nthat dividend effect, we kind of had to\n10:23\nalso validate that the code showed the\n10:25\nEPS decreasing or staying flat. And kind\n10:28\nof the wealth effect behind this is that\n10:29\nthe stock price drops by exactly the\n10:32\ndividend amount, which is $6 on that X\n10:34\ndividend. Um, and then our next question\n10:37\nto answer is incentive consistency. Are\n10:40\nstakeholder preferences aligned with\n10:42\ncalculated impacts? So, what we need to\n10:44\ndo is we kind of must ensure we aren't\n10:46\nrecommending something that uh decision\n10:49\nmakers would hate. So what we kind of\n10:51\ndid was validate the agency confl\n10:53\nconflict and kind of for the CEO\n10:56\nmanagement um there was a strong\n10:58\nalignment with the buyback with\n11:00\nBirkshshire we validated that it was a\n11:02\nstrong alignment with the buyback retail\n11:04\ninvestors uh aligned with their\n11:06\ndividends and we validate that the bond\n11:09\nholders was neutral to more negative\n11:12\nand um now we can kind of get into\n11:15\nimplement feasibility which is which\n11:18\noptions are most likely to gain\n11:19\nnecessary approvals. Um the buyback\n11:23\nobviously would have uh because it only\n11:25\nrequires the board approval and Apple\n11:27\nhas done this numerous times. And then\n11:30\nyou go to your special dividend again\n11:32\nhigh feasibility because that's easy to\n11:35\nexecute but however it's actually rarely\n11:38\ndone. um near strategic acquisition\n11:42\nwhich is more of a low feasibility uh\n11:44\nbecause it heavily scrutinizes big tech\n11:46\nand buying a big um\n11:50\nAI or VR or acquisition player would uh\n11:53\ntrigger an immediate antitrust lawsuit\n11:57\nand um that would take us to our last\n11:59\none which is the market validation and\n12:01\nthat is how would equity and debt\n12:03\nmarkets react. So uh reaction to the\n12:06\nbuyback this market uh views the uh\n12:10\nviews this as a safety signal and kind\n12:13\nof saying that Apple is more of a cash\n12:14\nmachine and believes it stock is\n12:17\nundervalued um stock price likely to\n12:20\nrise in this scenario and then you have\n12:22\nyour reaction to acquisition which is\n12:24\nyour stock price likely effectively\n12:26\nvolatile or or drops. And then lastly,\n12:30\nreaction to dividend which is yield\n12:31\nseeking investors might buy in but\n12:34\ngrowth investors might sell seeing it as\n12:35\na sign of stagnation which overall means\n12:39\nthat stock price is likely to fall and\n12:43\nwe kind of get to evolve which is\n12:46\nrecognizing the stakeholder analysis\n12:48\napplications across all corporate\n12:49\ndecisions. Um and our goal is kind of to\n12:51\nconnect it back to the sessions. And the\n12:53\nfirst one was capital structure and\n12:56\nfinancing which the core concept is the\n12:58\ntrade-off debt between uh between debt\n13:00\nand equity. And the application to Apple\n13:03\nis that Apple is holding $165 billion in\n13:07\ncash and it creates an agency problem\n13:09\nand kind of the uh shareholders worry\n13:12\nmight that they might waste money on bad\n13:14\nprojects. And a resolution behind this\n13:16\nwould be a the buyback uh is more of a\n13:19\ncapital structure decision. It returns\n13:22\nexcess cash to shareholders reducing\n13:24\nreducing that agency cost of equity. Um\n13:28\nand then we kind of get back uh relating\n13:29\nit to M&A uh session 11 and an\n13:33\napplication to this is the build versus\n13:35\nbuy choice um where the AVR acquisition\n13:40\nis an alternative and kind of signal\n13:42\nbehind this is that choosing a buyback\n13:44\nover M&A is a powerful signal\n13:47\num you have session 12 strategic\n13:49\nfinance. So that's the core concept is a\n13:52\nholistic decision- making. How does\n13:54\ncapital allocation support the long-term\n13:56\nbusiness strategy? Um, so that this\n13:58\napplication Apple is the life cycle\n14:00\nmanagement. Apple is transitioning from\n14:02\na high growth hardware company to more\n14:04\nof a services and cash flow company. The\n14:07\nkind of strategy behind this would be\n14:08\nthe buyback supports the transitions by\n14:11\nstabilizing the stock price and\n14:13\nmanufacturing EPS growth even when\n14:15\ntopline revenue growth slows.\n14:18\num kind of before I kind of get to the\n14:20\nend I want to show that um actually code\n14:24\nworks but furthermore my code kind of\n14:26\nhad show the different options going\n14:28\nback to the current status after buyback\n14:31\nversus after dividend. So as we see our\n14:34\nafter the buyback is still best option\n14:37\nkind of showing back in my table back\n14:40\nhere uh the buyback had all pretty much\n14:44\nneutral mixed for once but uh the other\n14:47\nthree were positive and that's kind of\n14:49\nshowing why uh the buyback has the\n14:51\nhighest amount where it's pretty much\n14:53\njust similar to current status\n14:56\num but also significantly both of them\n14:59\nare better than after the dividend. Um\n15:03\nbut um once I get into now the reflect\n15:07\npart um that is the synthesis why the\n15:10\nbuyback wins why is that the best option\n15:13\nand kind of looking at it from the math\n15:15\nincentives and strategies of everything\n15:16\nI went over um it's accretive uh ex\n15:22\naccreative so because Apple's earnings\n15:24\nyield uh is higher than the after cost\n15:28\nof cash uh retiring shares mechanically\n15:31\nboost CPS uh there are incentives behind\n15:34\nit. Um it kind of stops the management\n15:36\nfrom empire building with excess cash\n15:39\nand directly rewards the CEO and you\n15:42\nkind of have that strategy behind it.\n15:43\nWhat kind of just signals the maturity\n15:45\nas a company where they're not really\n15:47\nseen as a um high growth startup but\n15:50\nthey admit to be more cash cow. Um and\n15:54\nyou have your critique the limitations\n15:55\nof your model which is to kind of get\n15:57\nthe full marks of credible thinking. uh\n15:59\nyou must list the weaknesses uh of of my\n16:03\nanalysis. So it's kind of like the\n16:05\nstatic assumptions\n16:07\num your innovation risk and debt\n16:09\nblindness and then you have your ethical\n16:12\ngut check which is the back to the value\n16:15\ncreation versus transfer. Did we create\n16:17\nvalue? And honestly no we didn't just\n16:20\nmove money from the company bank account\n16:21\nto shareholders pockets.\n16:24\nuh we didn't build a better iPhone but\n16:26\nhowever we did prevent uh value\n16:28\ndestruction by not wasting money on a\n16:30\nbad acquisition we protected shareholder\n16:33\nvalue and that is a valid form of\n16:35\ncorporate stewardship\n16:37\nand yeah that is uh everything"
