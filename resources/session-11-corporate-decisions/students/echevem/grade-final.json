  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains that leverage amplifies returns and risks and notes debt adds fixed interest obligations, implying higher default/distress risk. They apply this across DRIVER stages with a scenario comparison and theory validation, demonstrating a thorough conceptual grasp suitable for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a D/Define stage that captures the problem statement, stakeholders, and objectives before any modeling. The Implement stage follows and references the prior representation, so the D-stage was completed and recorded up front, meeting the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states concrete future refinements (stress scenarios; interest-coverage and bondholder metrics), satisfying the strict requirement for an explicit Evolve stage. They also connect these refinements to broader corporate finance concepts (capital structure, incentives), so the criterion is fully met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and clearly explains that debt increases financial risk and distress potential, supported across Represent, Implement, and Validate. However, they never identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Under a moderate standard, this omission prevents a full pass; thus, Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies basic incentive divergence among shareholders, bondholders, and managers and links leverage to risk/return, but does not address employees or large holders, nor explain asset substitution or risk-shifting/wealth transfer via leverage or buybacks. Given the moderate standard, this is a sound but incomplete conceptual treatment, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames financing vs. operating effects and shows value transfer (risk/return shifts) with constant operations. However, they do not discuss signaling implications of buybacks vs. dividends vs. acquisitions, leaving a key part of the criterion unaddressed. Hence, PARTIAL.",
