  "transcript": "Hello. Today I'm presenting an\nindependent analysis of Apple's proposed\n$90 billion capital allocation plan\nusing the driver framework. I will\nevaluate whether this buyback creates\nvalue or merely transfers it.\nUh I began with the define and discover.\nSo I validated the market context. First\na critical correlation is that this\nproposal claims 90 billion as 10% of the\nmarket cap. However, at $185 per share\nand 15.5 billion shares, Apple is worth\nnearly 3 trillion. Therefore, 90 billion\nbuyback is actually only 3.1% of the\nfloat. I've adjusted my model to reflect\nthis correct mathematical reality and\nthat is taking place of all of this on\nthe Google Python.\nIn the represent phase, I built this\nPython class Apple Capital allocator\nwhich is seen right here all this\ncoding. So I parameterized the model\nhere with $165 billion liquidity and\n$110 billion debt. I then built the\ncalculate uh metrics which is\nthis section down here\num to handle the tradeoffs. For example,\nyou can see here in line 37\nwhich is actually going to be right\nabout here this area. Um if we use cash\nfor the buyback, we subtract the loss\ninterest income so after the tax that\nthe cash was previously generating. And\nthis ensures that we're measuring true\neconomic profit. Moving to the end plant\nphase,\nuh I'm executing a run analysis.\nSo down here,\num so let's take a look at this data\nframe output. The baseline EPS is\n6.15 or 6.17. So the buyback scenario\nraises the EPS to 6.23.\nIt actually accelerates that. And then\nthe acquisition scenario suggests that a\nhigher EPS of $646\nassuming that we can find assets\nyielding 12% which is a high risk\nassumption\nand all that is shown down here.\nUm\nto validate I visualize the stakeholder\nimpacts\nstuff is all these graphs down here. So\nlooking at the middle graph in the\ndividend scenario\nuh the stock price drops so right here\npushing the value of employee options\nwhich is the line up here\ndown towards zero. So this actually\nhurts the employee retention and then\nconversely look at the right graph\nBirkshshire pathway um their ownership\njumps from 6% to 6.19%\nin the buyback scenario without them\nspending a penny. So this validates the\nbuyback as a tax efficient value\ntransfer. To uh evolve this analysis, we\nconsider signaling. So a 90 billion\nbuyback at a PE of 30 implies management\nbelieves the stock is undervalued or\nthat they have no R&D ideas capable of\nbeating a 3.3%\nearnings yield. So while the acquisition\nscenario showed a higher EPS in my\nmodel, the execution risk is also\nhigher. The buyback is the safe signal\nof capital discipline. So finally my\nrecommendation I recommend proceeding\nwith the $90 billion buyback as it\naligns the employee options incentives\n$170 strike. Uh I also think it rewards\nlong-term holders like Birkshshire uh\nmore tax efficiently. It is superior to\na dividend which triggers immediate tax\nevents. So however we must admit this is\na large largely value transfer from ex\nexisting shareholders to remaining one\nor exiting to remaining sorry rather\nthan an organic value creation. Thankyou."
