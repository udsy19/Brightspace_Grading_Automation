  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly shows leverage boosts equity returns (EPS up ~11%) while increasing risk (higher leverage, less cash cushion, risk for bondholders). They also note debt’s fixed interest burden and its effect on credit quality/default risk via the debt reduction scenario. This coverage is specific, applied across options, and aligned with DRIVER stages, meeting a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital-structure factors (cash levels, leverage/risk, flexibility) and contrasts options, then recommends a directionally balanced mix (partial buyback and debt reduction). Their analysis uses DRIVER to quantify impacts and weigh trade-offs, demonstrating thorough introductory-level reasoning on optimal capital structure.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes value transfer (buybacks/dividends) from value creation (projects with ROIC > cost of capital, debt paydown lowering interest cash outflows) and evaluates opportunity cost across alternatives. Multiple options are compared with specific impacts on cash, leverage, stakeholders, and long-term strategy, meeting the depth expected for a PASS in a moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies the risk side of the trade-off—higher leverage increases financial risk and reduces flexibility—across Implement and Validate stages. However, they never mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Because only one side of the trade-off is addressed, this meets a correct but incomplete standard, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies who gains and loses under each option and links incentives (e.g., EPS-based management pay, bondholder risk preferences), satisfying the stakeholder agency-conflict portion. However, asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage/buybacks are only briefly noted (“higher leverage = more risk”) without deeper explanation of equity’s option-like incentives or bondholder expropriation, so coverage is correct but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes value transfer (financing actions affecting EPS, leverage, stakeholder risk) from potential value creation (acquisition/R&D with ROIC vs cost of capital). However, signaling analysis is brief and surface-level (e.g., “share price support,” “doesn’t impress shareholders”) without deeper discussion of market perception across buybacks, dividends, and acquisitions. Correct but not thorough, so PARTIAL.",
