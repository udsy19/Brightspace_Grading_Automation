  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and this is my\nsession 11 video assignment.\nSo,\nin this session, it gives us a scenario.\nTesla needs $5 billion to fund European\nGigafactory expansion. Uh, Chief\nFinancial Officer Officer Zachary King\nHorde presents three financing options\nto the board.\nOption A is pure equity,\noption B is pure debt, and option C is\nthe hybrid approach.\nSo\nbasically, I'm going to try to break\nthese down. So\num let's see.\nSo for option A, the amount raised would\nbe like $5 billion. Basically, the share\nprice would be $333 per share.\nAnd if you do the math, you actually get\nabout\nover 15 billion shares in total.\nUm, so what about the pros and cons? So\nthe pros,\nuh, there's no annual interest payments\nand it maintains the,\num, company's financial flexibility.\nuh it strengthens the balance sheet by\nincreasing equity which typically lowers\nthe risk of bankruptcy.\nAnd for the cons,\nit dilutes existing shareholders by 5%.\nThis means current owners will own a\nsmaller percentage of the company and a\nsmaller share of future earnings.\nNow moving on here to option B for pure\ndebt.\nSo basically it involves borrowing the\nentire amount by issuing some corporate\nbonds and the amount raised is once\nagain $5 billion.\nAnnual interest rate is 4.5%.\nAnd the annual interest payments\nit's 5 billion and then you multiply it\nby a factor of 0.045 045 which would be\n225 million for 10 years overall.\nSo the pros of that one um\nlet's see\nso there' be no uh dilution of existing\nshareholders\nownership compared to option A where\nthat was one of the cons.\nUm, interest payments are typically tax\ndeductible. Offering a tax shield, it\nallows for potential leverage.\nAnd now for the cons,\nuh, option B here,\nuh, commits the company, it would commit\nthe company to a $225 billion in annual\nfixed interest payments,\ncreating a debt-free service or a debt\nservice burden overall.\nuh it would increase the risk of\nbankruptcy if cash flow struggles\nuh because those payments would be\nmandatory.\nAnd lastly down here you've got option C\nwhich is the hybrid approach that kind\nof combines them together.\nSo\nI mean this one overall like balances\nthe use of equity and debt financing.\nUm the equity component is about 2.5\nbillion. So is the debt component.\nUm obviously pros there's a lot. Uh it\nwould provide a balanced approach\nbetween option A and B.\nThe dilution is cut in half to compared\nto option A and annual interest payment\nis cut in half compared to option B\nwhich would reduce the overall debt\nservice burden to 112.5\nmillion\nand that would offer offer like\nmoderateish\nleverage and financial risk as well.\nUm, cons obviously would involve some\ndilution and some fixed annual payments,\nbut given the fact that it it cuts the\ntwo in half, I personally would have to\ngo with option C."
