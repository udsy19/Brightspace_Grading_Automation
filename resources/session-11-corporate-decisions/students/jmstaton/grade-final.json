  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the problem, stakeholder, and initial objective at the beginning of the transcript and then proceeds to analyze options, satisfying the requirement that Define/Discover was completed before modeling. The clear front-loaded Discover statements support a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executes the planned analysis with traceable steps: stated a plan, performed numerical calculations for equity and debt, and compared outcomes across scenarios. While not deeply technical, the workflow is systematic and links execution to the Represent plan and Evolve comparisons, meeting the moderate IMPLEMENT standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the interest tax shield and the increased financial risk of debt, and notes a balanced hybrid approach. However, the treatment is brief and mainly lists pros/cons without deeper discussion of the trade-off mechanics or implications, so it meets the criterion at a basic level rather than thoroughly.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not analyze agency conflicts across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor does it explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage or buybacks. It focuses on dilution, tax shields, and bankruptcy risk at a firm level without identifying who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. Given the absence of stakeholder conflict analysis, this criterion fails.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that debt adds fixed interest obligations, increasing bankruptcy/default risk, and mentions leverage/tax shield and dilution effects. However, they do not thoroughly explain how leverage amplifies returns (e.g., EPS/ROE) with depth or examples, making the treatment basic rather than comprehensive.",
