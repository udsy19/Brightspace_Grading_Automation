  "transcript": "0:02\nHello, I'm Alexandra Garland and I'm\n0:04\npresenting on session 11 um my\n0:06\ncomprehensive driver analysis for\n0:08\nApple's proposed $90 billion capital\n0:12\nallocation decision.\n0:14\nOur goal is to move beyond simple\n0:17\nanalysis and determine if this buyback\n0:19\ntruly creates value or if an alternative\n0:22\nis financially superior.\n0:24\nSo we begin with define and discover. So\n0:27\nthe financial context is very crucial.\n0:29\nApp Apple has $165 billion in cash\n0:33\nagainst $110 billion in debt. And the\n0:37\nstakeholder conflict is that the\n0:39\ndecision pits shareholders the that are\n0:41\nseeking the EPSdriven gains against bond\n0:44\nholders who are fearing increased\n0:47\nleverage.\n0:49\nThe opportunity cost is that our cash is\n0:52\ncurrently earning a high tax uh high tax\n0:57\nefficient yield of 4.5%. And this\n0:59\ninterest income represents the high\n1:01\nhurdle the buyback must overcome to\n1:04\nprove its worth. So getting into our\n1:06\nrepresent stage or um or our analytical\n1:10\nplan. So we translate this tension into\n1:13\na quantitative model. So we will compare\n1:16\nthe buyback against a dividend by\n1:18\nmodeling three core effects. The EPS\n1:22\naccretion versus dilution which is the\n1:24\ntest for immediate shareholder value.\n1:26\nAnd then second the leverage which is\n1:28\nthe measure of risk or net debt for our\n1:31\ncreditors. And then third is efficiency.\n1:35\nUm and this is measured by the return on\n1:38\ninvested capital also known as the ROIC.\n1:46\nAnd then getting into our uh moving to\n1:48\nimplement we wanted I want to go and\n1:52\nshow our Python code here.\n1:58\nUm so we built this analyze decision\n2:03\nwhich is shown here. Sorry\n2:06\nwe um built the analyze decision\n2:08\nfunction. though which this is the\n2:11\nfinancial engine of the model. Um and\n2:14\nthen the\n2:17\ncalculations are here shown\n2:20\nand this function simultaneously\n2:22\ncalculates the impact on multiple\n2:24\nstakeholders for the EPS impact. It\n2:26\ndirect directly compares the cost of\n2:29\nloss enters income against the benefit\n2:32\nof retired shares and it then calculates\n2:36\nthe shift in net debt. explaining this.\n2:39\nSorry.\n2:41\nIt then calculates the shift in net debt\n2:44\nto quantify the risk transferred to our\n2:46\nbond holders and then um\n2:52\nshowing the output that we've got\n2:55\nfrom this code.\n2:59\nSo on this um you see the financial\n3:02\ndecision analysis that we got after\n3:04\nrunning the code. And so running the\n3:06\nfunction at the current $185 price, the\n3:09\noutput confirms the following. So the\n3:11\nEPS impact is this change is\n3:14\nnegative0.06%\n3:17\nwhich results in dilution and post\n3:19\nbuyback EPS is flat at around $645.\n3:24\nThe for second the leverage which is\n3:26\nbond holder risk. We transition from a\n3:29\ncurrent net debt of55\n3:32\num billion um which is cashrich to a\n3:36\npost buyback net debt of $35 billion\n3:39\nwhich is leveraged.\n3:42\nAnd then third the ROIC\n3:45\num which is the return on invested\n3:47\ncapital. the model shows a massive 2050%\n3:50\nimprovement in return on invested\n3:53\ncapital. And then\n3:56\num for the time value of money output\n3:58\nwhich is shown right here is always\n4:00\ngoing back to what we learned in the\n4:02\nbeginning. So our um time value of money\n4:08\nanalysis calculates the present value of\n4:11\nthe buyback's future stock appreciation\n4:13\nversus the dividends immediate cash\n4:15\npayout. So the special dividend offers\n4:18\n$5.81 shown here\n4:22\nimmediate value while the buyback value\n4:24\nadded is a negative\n4:27\n10 per share. And this confirms the\n4:30\ndividend is mathematically superior\n4:32\ntoday.\n4:34\nAnd then going into the validate section\n4:37\njust to show a sensitivity analysis. Um\n4:40\nthis is a sensitivity\n4:43\nanalysis table that we created um from\n4:45\nour Python code shown up here from um\n4:50\nthese functions. Just one sec.\n4:54\nThis is just from the sensitivity\n4:56\nanalysis and then our um output from\n4:59\nthat is located here as I was showing.\n5:03\nSo\n5:04\num in the validate stage we wanted to\n5:07\ntest the fragility of the buyback with a\n5:11\nsensitivity analysis and I use the run\n5:13\nsensitivity and run sensitivity analysis\n5:16\nfunction shown just a second ago to test\n5:19\nthe EPS outcome across a different range\n5:22\nof prices. And so\n5:26\num the table clearly shows the break\n5:28\neven point. So the buyback is uh\n5:31\naccreditive\n5:32\nonly when the share price is $165\n5:37\num sorry a credit only when the share\n5:40\nprice is $165 or less and at our current\n5:43\nprice of $185 the outcome is dilution\n5:46\nwhich is a negative.06%.\n5:49\nAnd this proves the buyback is\n5:51\ninefficient and financially fragile at\n5:53\nthe market's current validation.\n5:56\nAnd then this um tradeoff the EPS versus\n6:00\nleverage risk graph. So this right here\n6:03\nshown in blue and gray.\n6:06\nSo the gray just shows the current and\n6:08\nthe blue shows the post buyback. And um\n6:10\nthe bar chart visually validates the\n6:12\ntrade-off. The small neutral EPS gain\n6:16\ncomes at the cost of a major negative\n6:18\nshift in net debt.\n6:20\nAnd then also to um validate these\n6:24\nresults and the calculations that I use,\n6:26\nI use some of the ones um in the\n6:28\ntextbook that we have as well as um I\n6:31\nworked with AI and um Google Gemini to\n6:34\nmake sure that all of the calculations I\n6:36\nwas using in the time value of money um\n6:38\ncalculations as well as a sensitivity\n6:40\nanalysis and different EPS and leverage\n6:43\nrisk calculations were correct to help\n6:45\nto validate my results.\n6:49\nAnd then\n6:51\nscrolling through here which is just the\n6:54\nvalidate that shows our table that I\n6:56\nshowed in the python.\n6:59\nSo we wanted to evolve by assessing\n7:02\nalternatives. Debt reduction is too\n7:04\nconservative and lowers roe and um and\n7:09\nlarge scale R&D is too speculative. So\n7:12\nour final decision must resolve the\n7:14\nconflicts highlighted in our analysis.\n7:16\nSo\n7:18\num I just wanted to go over a few\n7:20\nmoments of the aha moments that I had.\n7:23\nSo number one is the false um accretion\n7:25\nmyth. The implementation and validation\n7:27\nstages revealed the buyback is dilutive\n7:29\nat $185. And this defies the common\n7:33\nbelief that buybacks are always\n7:35\naccretive\n7:37\nand or accretion. So the root cause is\n7:40\nthe opportunity cost. the 4.5% interest\n7:43\nwe lose is too high to justify retiring\n7:46\nshares at this um price.\n7:51\nAnd then the second um moment that I um\n7:56\ndidn't know before was the ROIC which is\n7:59\nreturn on invested capital versus risk\n8:01\nconflict. So we found a um a sorry a\n8:04\n20.50% 50% ROIC improvement. But this\n8:08\nefficiency gain directly caused our net\n8:10\ndebt position to flip from cashri to\n8:13\nleveraged. And the decision that\n8:14\nmaximizes efficiency simultaneously\n8:17\nintroduces maximum financial risk to our\n8:20\nbond holders. And with all of this in\n8:23\nmind as well as our analysis and\n8:24\ncalculations with the help of um Python,\n8:28\nour final recommendation recommendation\n8:30\nis based on resolving both of these\n8:32\nconflicts. So our final recommendation\n8:34\nis to execute a $90 billion special\n8:37\ndividend and it solves both my two aha\n8:41\nmoments. So the time value of money\n8:43\nanalysis proves the dividend avoids the\n8:45\nvalue destruction and provides the\n8:47\nhighest present value return which the\n8:50\ncomparison of $5.81 versus negative10.\n8:54\nAnd then it solves um the second aha\n8:58\nmoment because it addresses the risk\n8:59\nconflict by leaving the leverage profile\n9:02\nlargely unchanged inuring that greater\n9:05\nprotection for our bond holders while\n9:07\nreturning capital. And um just kind of\n9:11\nlooking at this too for our reflection\n9:13\nsection um with a contradictory signal\n9:17\nthe only reason to provide to to proceed\n9:19\nwith the buyback is the high 20.50% ROIC\n9:22\nimprovement it provides. However, it's\n9:24\nimportant to remember that this gain um\n9:27\ndoes not completely offset the immediate\n9:28\nvalue destruction shown by the negative\n9:30\nEPS as well as the time value of money\n9:32\nconso confirming the dividend is the\n9:34\noptimal choice. And um looking at risk\n9:37\nmanagement as well, this um\n9:39\nrecommendation avoids a significant\n9:40\nincrease in net debt that would be\n9:42\ndetrimental to bond holders, which is\n9:44\nwhat we wanted to um focus on in this.\n9:47\nSo, thank you so much and that'll be\n9:48all."
