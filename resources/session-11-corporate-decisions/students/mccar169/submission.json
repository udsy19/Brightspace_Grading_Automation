  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Colleen McCarthy and this\nis my session 11 assignment um on the\ncorporate financial decision analysis.\nSo starting off with the find and\ndiscover. So the problem and context the\ncore question is does a $90 billion\nshare repurchase create genuine economic\nvalue for Apple or is it merely a\ntransfer of value? So we must evaluate\nthis proposal against the alternative\nuses of capital like dividends and R&D\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\nSo for the givens we have the company\nstate we have the proposal which is the\n90 $99 90 billion buyback and we also\nhave the stakeholders and alternatives.\nSo moving on to the financial\nobjectives.\nSo for the to quant I will be\nquantifying metrics. I will compare\nscenarios. I will also analyze agency\nand signaling and lastly produce a\nrecommendation.\nNow for a quick knowledge check within\nterminology. So I want to un ensure that\nI understand these concepts starting\nfirst with value creation versus value\ntransfer. So buybacks usually transfer\nvalue whereas R&D accusations create\nvalue. And then also for the signaling\ntheory a buyback suggests management\nbelieves the stock is undervalued.\nSo is it actually undervalued is what\nwe're going to be trying to figure out.\nand also for the agency cost is a CEO\npushing for a buyback to boost EPS and\nand their bonus or the value of their\nshares rather than investing in the\nbusiness.\nAnd lastly for WACC/ capital structure,\nhow does reducing equity buyback impact\nthe company's risk profile? So for the\nvideo flow, I'm going to start with the\nintro, move to the base case, and then\nshow the buyback model and the\nstakeholder anal analysis and then show\ncomparison and contrast with the special\ndividend and the AI accusation and then\nwrap it up with the conclusion.\nOkay, so moving on to the represent\nstage. So for the analytical approach\nI'll be using um\nI will construct a comparative model in\nPython and I'll the model will define a\nbase case\nthe status quo compared to compared\nagainst two primary test cases. Starting\noff with the buyback scenario this will\nbe the spending $90 billion in retire\nshares. Then for number two, the\nalternative scenario would be paying\nexposed acquisition and we are solving\nfor delta or the change in which is a\nchange in shareholder value EPS and\nstakeholder wealth under each scenario.\nSo these are the key values and inputs.\nAnd now for the ma mathematical logic\nfor the formulas we have the driving net\nincome formula here the buyback\nmechanics\nformula and calculation here. Now for\npart C we have the shire the new EPS\nyou find out using this formula.\nAnd then lastly for the stakeholder\nimpact we'll be using the co wealth\nalong with the employee option value.\nThen for the Python plan, we're going to\ndefine the inputs, calculate the base\nmetrics, run the simulation, and then\nalso run alternate simulations and then\nvisualize. Let's move on to the\nimplementation\nstage. So first for the financial logic\nand strategy, we're going to translate\nour represent plan into a working\nfinancial model. So the goal is to\nisolate the mechanical effects of the\nbuyback from the strategic effects. So\nI'll calculate we will calculate the\nEPS.\nSo how much does the EPS rise purely\nbecause we reduce the denominator also\nthe implied share price. So if the\nmarket values apple the same multiple\nafter the buyback along with the\nalternative yield. So why this matters?\nThis allows us to see if the buyback\ncreates real value or just um optimal\nvalue.\nafter the code. So here we're going to\nrun this.\nNow for the financial impact analysis,\nyou can see everything\nlaid out nicely here in this graph.\nSo to interpret the output looking at\nthe visual visualization above right\nhere\nwe can see that for the\nsugar high the EPS growth the status quo\nis around 6.17 here in this left box and\nbuyback is 6.37\njust for some insight the buyback\nmechanically increases EPS by roughly\n3.2% and this is created solely by\nreducing the share count which\nthe the denominator not by improving\nbusiness operations which is the\nnumerator. Also you can see the price\nsignal\nand dividend tradeoff. So the\nalternative is a $5 $581 special\ndividend. So for the shareholders, they\nmust decide if they prefer $5.81 in hard\ncash today or theoretically a\ntheoretical $6 increase in stock value\nbuyback\nand this is a tax efficient dividend is\nrisk-free cash. So to summarize that the\nmodel confirms that a 90 billion buyback\nprovides a modest EPS boost. However,\nbecause the boost is so small around 3%,\nwe must question if\nif it's worth it or if it's worth this\nminor optical improvement.\nSo now to validate, so did the model\nworked? Yes, the code executed\nsuccessfully producing a data frame and\ncomparison chart. There were no syntax\nerrors in the visualization correctly\ndisplayed the trade-off between the EPS\nboost buyback and the cash in hand\ndividend. So for the logic verification\nbefore we trust the output let's\nvalidate it validate the logic manually.\nSo we can check the buyback size along\nwith the mass and the impact here and\nthe result. So after running all that\nthe verdict is that the Python model\noutput aligns perfectly with financial\ntheory and the math holds up. So now how\ndo we interpret these results?\nvalidation highlights a critical insight\nfor our recommendation. So the pop is\nthat the buyback only generates a modest\naround 3% increase in value per share.\nMoving on, the cost to achieve this\nsmall gain, we deplete 55% of our\nliquidity. Lastly, the risk is a 3% EPS\nbump justify significantly reducing our\ncash buffer. So this suggests the\nbuyback must be efficient financially.\nPerhaps a strategically perhaps a very\nstrategically risky. Okay, moving on to\nevolve optimizing the decision. So is\nthere a better way in the implement\nphase? We tested a binary choice, the\nbuyback or status quo. However, in the\nreal world, the best decision is often a\nhybrid approach. So the conflict is that\nthere's an agency view. So with $165\nbillion in cash management might be\ntempted to make bad acquisitions just to\ndo something with all that money and a\nbuyback disciplines management by\nreturning the cash to shareholders.\nAnother conflict is that there's an\ninnovation view. So Apple needs to\ncompete in AI and VR. So spending $90\nbillion in stock leaves less dry powder\nfor a massive strategic acquisition like\nbuying a major media or at a lab.\nSecondly, looking at the stakeholder\nanalysts, um the model results signify\ndifferent things to different people. So\nthe CEO and versus the employees\nalong with the long-term shareholders\nlike Brookstar\nBrookshshire\nvery they might prefer the companies\nstrictly they might prefer that the\ncompany strictly creates long-term value\nthrough R&D rather than shortterm price\nbump. And then for the evolved\nrecommendation,\nI instead of a generic yes or no, the\nanalysis suggests a conditional\napproval.\nSo approve the buyback. This is because\nat $165 cash is inefficient and it's\nearning low interest. So for the\nconstraint, even after spending $90\nbillion, Apple still has 75 plus 100\nannual FCF. So this is ample liquidity\nfor the AI re research and development\nand then just to conclude we can afford\nboth the buyback and the innovation\nstrategy and the trade-off is not\nmutually exclusive. So finally just to\nreflect the verdict so the final\nrecommendation and based on the driver\nanalysis I recommend executing a $90\nbillion share repurchase program. This\nis because the model demonstrates that\nthe buyback increases EPS by around 3.2%\n2% in align management incentives\nwithout compromising the company's\nfinancial wealth and we still retain\nmassive liquidity. And just to check\nthis while a special dividend offers\nimmediate cash, the buyback offers tax\nefficient efficiently and signals\nconfidence to the market that the stock\nis undervalued\nalso for the process. So just a little\nquick overview on how driver guided my\nsolution. This wasn't just about using\nPython, it was also about structured\nthinking. So we started with the\ndiscover phase and identified the core\ntension between cash safety and share\nreturns. We move on to represent stage\nwhere we translated the tension into\nvariables.\nNext using Python to strip away emotion\nand look at the raw mechanics and prove\nthat EP that EPS impact is positive but\nmodest. Lastly we validated by Sam we\nchecked our math to ensure the sugar\nhigh calculated correctly. Then finally\nbe involved and realize that we do not\nneed to choose between the buyback and\nR&D and apples won't be enough to do\nboth. So lastly for my personal\nreflection and learning through this\nproject I learned that financial\nmodeling is a storytelling tool. The\nPython code didn't make the decision for\nme. It gave me the data to make the\ndecision myself. By visualizing the\ndifference between the dividend payout\nand the stock price increase, I could\nclearly see the trade-offs stakeholders\nface. The driver framework ensured I\ndidn't jump straight to the code but\nfirst understood the business context to\nensure my analyst solved the right\nproblem.\nThank you. And as for AI, AI helped me\nwith the code and creating the graph\ncorrectly and interpreting helped me\nfigure out what I was trying to say into\nmore professional terms.Thank you."
