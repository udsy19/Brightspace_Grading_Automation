  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly frames the problem, perspective, and affected stakeholders at the start (Discover) before the student describes creating the model (Represent/Implement). This meets the strict requirement that Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student described a concrete implementation workflow (Gemini + Colab), produced traceable outputs (charts, reported EPS changes), and tied those outputs back to the analysis goals with numeric checks and an alternative scenario. This shows a systematic execution of the planned analysis consistent with the moderate IMPLEMENT standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student does not identify debt’s tax benefits (interest tax shield) nor discuss increased financial risk/distress from leverage. The statement about “more equity” leading to more leverage suggests confusion about capital structure. Given the moderate standard, even a brief conceptual mention would suffice, but it is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student names some stakeholders who benefit (shareholders, large holders, CEO, employees) but does not identify any losers (e.g., bondholders) or explain why incentives diverge under buybacks versus alternatives. There is no discussion of asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage; the leverage comment is incorrect. Given these gaps, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student mentions EPS effects but does not explain that leverage amplifies both returns and risks or note that debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. The statement linking “more equity” to “more leverage” indicates misunderstanding. Under moderate standards, the core leverage-risk concepts are missing, so this fails the criterion.",
