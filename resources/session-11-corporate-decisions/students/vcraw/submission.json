  "transcript": "All right. Hello. Uh my name is Vincent\nand uh this is my session 11 assignment.\nUm the purpose of this video analysis is\nto evaluate Apple's\nuh hypothetical\n$90 billion share repurchase proposal\nagainst key capital allocation\nalternatives. Um, so our objective is to\ndetermine if the buyback maximizes\nlong-term value per share and how it\nbalances the the complex incentives of\nall share or stakeholders. So we're\ngoing to be using the driver framework\num to solve this problem uh and to\nstructure our analysis and move from the\nproblem definition all the way to the\nfinal risk adjusted recommendation.\nSo we will start at the define and\ndiscover\num stage.\nSo\npretty much the challenge we had was\nApple has excuse me 90 billion in cash\nto allocate. Uh we must choose among\nfour core options.\nuh they are share buyback, a special\ndividend, debt reduction or a strategic\nR&D acquisition of like VR and AI. Um\nso we're looking at like the initial\nsnapshot. So Apple has a massive\nfinancial capacity with $165 billion in\nliquidity and hundred billion in annual\nfree cash flow. Uh the stock trades at\n$185\nwith a PE of 30 um 30 times. So\njust going back and checking those uh\ncalculations. So we have\nthe initial earnings per share. Um so to\nfind that we take the initial earnings\nand then divide it by the initial shares\num which is 95.5 billion divided by 15.5\nbillion and that gives you 16.7\nor 6.17\n$6.17\nand then you do the initial market price\nwhich is the market value, the initial\nmarket value, and then the uh divided by\nthe initial shares. And that's 28\n2,868\nbillion divided by 15.5 billion, which\nis about $185.\nUm,\nuh, so\nthat's our key metrics. total earnings\nof 95.58\nbillion and then the initial manageable\nle leverage of 3.8%\nwhich is at hundred billion of debt\ndivided by the 2686\n2868\nbillion market cap.\nSo pretty much the prevail the\nprevailing market signal from management\nis confidence via the buyback. Our\nanalysis must validate or contradict\nthis signal by quantifying the full\nstakeholder impact. Um so yeah that's\npretty much the define and discover\nstage. So we're going to move on to the\nrepresent and the implement stages. All\nright. So looking through our code.\nSo our quantitative work is anchored by\nthe capital allocation model which is a\nsimple parameterized\nmo model that automates year one impact\ncalculations across all four scenarios.\nUm which is meeting the technical\nrequirements for a transer transparent\nreproductive model. Um so\nlooking at the EPS delta percentage and\nthe new leverage columns\non the year 1 impact.\nUm so pretty much we immediately review\nthe immediate year one quantitative\nimpact of $90 billion outlay. So\nthe buyback uh pretty much reduces share\ncount by\n0.4\n0.86\nbillion um leading to respectable plus\n3.24% 24% earnings per share accretion\nuh and a new EPS of 6.37\nuh and then the leverage ticks up\nslightly 4%.\nUm\nthe debt reduction this option provides\na near identical boost uh plus 3.01 01\nearnings per share. And\nwe see that by the earnings plus the\nincreased interest savings over the\nshares. Uh and then that gives us 6.35\nfor the new earnings per share. And then\nthe earnings per share.\nOkay.\nis plus 3.01%.\nAnd that's the EPS accretion. Uh by\nsaving us approximately\n200 2.75 billion in an annual interest.\nUh, crucially, the new debt balance\nplummets to 20 billion, dropping the\nleverage negligible\nto a negligible 0.7%.\nAnd then we'll look at the\ndividend and R&D.\nSo these options are the uh earnings per\nshare neutral in the immediate year as\nthey do not affect share account or net\nincome directly.\nUm\nand then the ROIC impact for research\nand development is pretty much the great\nunknown.\nSo, we don't really know um if there's\ngoing to be\nlike good enough benefits in the end\nfrom the ROIC impact.\nUm and then we go to stage four. That's\nthe validate stage. So, we're going to\nlook at the value creation versus the\nvalue transfer.\nUm so,\nwe're going to look at the buyback and\ndividend first. So these are the\nfundamental value transfers. Um they\nmove cash from the company's balance\nsheet to the shareholders pocket. The\ntotal economic pie remains the same. Uh\nthe shareholder just gets a bigger or\nearlier slice of of that pie. I guess uh\nthe value is destroyed if the buyback\nprice is above the intrinsic value. So\nthen we look at debt reduction. Uh this\nis a form of value creation through\nguaranteed low-risk interest savings\nwhich will overall directly boost net\nincome. Uh and then we look at that\nresearch and development acquisition ac\nacquisition of the AI VR thing. Uh and\nthen this is the only option for a new\nlong-term value creation, but it it\nrequires\na super ROIC hurdle\nuh about 15% and carries the highest\nexecution risk.\nUh\nlook at this table bar chart.\nSo pretty much the buyback is a a an\nagency issue. It perfectly aligns with\nthe management's incentives.\nSo the CEO's 3M shares option value and\nthe bonus metrics tied to the earnings\nper share and then which these can\npromote short-term\nshort-termism over the long-term\nstrategic research and development. Uh\nthe debt reduction however provides a\nmaterial earnings per share gain without\nthe same moral hazard. It offers a clear\nlower risk path to accretion that is\nalso a massive win for bond holders. So\nthat's like setting the stage for\npotential credit ratings upgrades. Um\nand then we'll go to the evolve stage.\nSo this is like the signaling effect. So\ncapital allocation is loud signal to the\nmarket. So we look at the buyback signal\nfirst. Uh we believe that the stock is\nundervalued\num with the price earnings of 30 times\nand that we lack the hard hard uh\nROI internal projects and then the R&D\nacquisition signal is we are focused on\naggressive future growth. That's the AI\nVR uh acquisition.\nIt's very aggressive because everyone's\nin AI and VR. And if Apple would do\nthis, it'd be high risk, high reward\ntype of thing. And then looking at debt\nreduction signal, uh signal\nconservatism, risk aversion, and capital\ndiscipline, prior prior prioritizing the\nbalance sheet, strength for future\nopportunistic investments.\nAnd then the sensitivity to the\nexecution. So we're going to look at the\nlong-term success of each option and\nseeing if it's sensitive to different\nfactors.\nUh so then we're looking at the buyback\nagain and it's highly sensitive to the\naverage uh execution price. If the stock\nprice is bid up, we repurchase fewer\nshares and the EPS boost shrinks.\nOverpaying destroys value. Um and then\nwe look at the R&D acquisition that AIVR\nand it is sensitive to the ROIC hurdle.\nAnd then failure failure to generate a\nreturn above the cost of capital means\nthe $90 billion was value destructive\noverall.\nAnd then going through the debt\nreduction, it is the least sensitive\nbecause it's providing a certain and\nguaranteed return via interest savings\nregardless of that market volatility.\nUm\nyeah, that's pretty much\nthe um\nevolve stage of our driver framework.\nAnd now we'll go to the reflect stage.\nSo um we have defined the problem and\nmodeled the outcomes and validated the\nvalue dynamics and evolved the\ntrade-offs. Uh we now have to move to\nthe final riskadjusted recommendation.\nSo my recommendation is doing that $90\nbillion debt reduction. Um\nand the rationale behind that is first\nof all the risk adjust adjusted value\ncreation that debt reduction provides a\ncomparable immediate earnings per share\nboost uh from $6.35 to $6.37\nfor the buyback uh through certain\nlowrisk tax efficient interest savings.\nUm and then this is a superior to the\nmarket timing and agency risk inherent\nin the buyback. Um and then secondly we\nlook at the strategic flexibility. So\ndropping the new leverage ratio from\n3.8% to a near zero\num 0.7%\ncleans the balance sheet and provides a\nmassive financial safety budget or\nbuffer. Um this position of strength is\nultimate is the ultimate enabler for\nfuture opportunistic high conviction\nresearch and development or acquisition\nacquisition investments without external\npressure. And then the third and final\nthing was the stakeholder balance. Uh so\nit's highly favorable for bond holders\nand remains\nassertive for shareholders and\nemployees. Uh it also demonstrates\nlong-term capital discipline and reduces\nfuture interest rate risk maximizing the\nreturn on riskadjusted capital. And then\noverall\nuh debt reduction is a superior\nstrategic move providing an assertive\nlowrisk return while preserving\noptionally for future growth. That is mysession 11 assignment. Thank you."
