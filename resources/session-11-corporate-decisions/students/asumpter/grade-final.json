  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student specified a clear plan (market scenarios, portfolio valuations, hedged vs unhedged comparisons) before running code and then executed that plan, producing graphs and payoff comparisons and reporting hedge effectiveness. This demonstrates a systematic linkage from representation to implementation and validation, meeting the moderate standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission contains no mention of debt, interest tax shields, or financial distress/insolvency risk. It focuses entirely on option hedging strategies, not capital structure. Given the absence of any conceptual treatment, the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on option hedging strategies, outputs, and a recommendation, with no mention of shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders, nor any analysis of who gains/loses or why incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting tied to leverage or buybacks. Given the complete absence of the required concepts, this criterion fails despite acceptable Discover/Implement activity.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on option hedging strategies and Greeks, with no treatment of how leverage amplifies returns and risks or how debt’s fixed interest obligations increase default risk. Because the criterion’s key concepts are missing, it does not meet even a basic conceptual standard.",
