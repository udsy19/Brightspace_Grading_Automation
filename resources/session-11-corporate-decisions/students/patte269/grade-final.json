  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses relevant capital structure factors (liquidity, leverage, risk) and explicitly measures leverage to inform the decision. They provide a clear, supported directional preference (balanced buyback with debt reduction absent high-ROIC opportunities), showing thorough conceptual understanding aligned with multiple DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly distinguishes genuine value creation (ROIC above WACC) from value transfer (mechanical EPS from buybacks) and evaluates multiple deployment alternatives with clear stakeholder implications. They explicitly consider the opportunity cost of the $90B and the long-term strategic impact of reinvestment versus buybacks and debt reduction. Multiple DRIVER stages provide comprehensive, conceptually solid support, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a baseline plus multiple sensitivities (including two reinvestment cases) and outputs that compare return and risk. The student explicitly identifies the critical breakpoint (ROIC > WACC) and maps how stakeholder preferences change across scenarios, demonstrating thorough scenario and sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student correctly identifies that higher debt increases financial risk and shows this via leverage metrics and stakeholder impacts, but does not mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate standard, the risk side is covered conceptually, yet the absence of the tax benefit discussion prevents a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies some winners/losers (short-term holders/option owners vs. bondholders vs. long-term equity) and references agency and leverage, but coverage is basic. They do not thoroughly explain why incentives diverge across management, employees, and large holders, nor explicitly discuss asset substitution and risk-shifting under buybacks/leverage. Hence, solid conceptual nods but insufficient depth for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links financing choices to return (EPS) and risk via leverage, and notes interest as a fixed cost and that debt reduction lowers risk. However, they do not thoroughly explain how leverage amplifies both upside and downside or explicitly connect debt to default risk. The coverage is accurate but basic, supporting a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.",
