  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, my name is Kulpreet Singh and\n0:03\ntoday I'll be acting as an independent\n0:05\nanalysis to evaluate Apple's proposed 90\n0:08\nmill billion share repurchase program\n0:11\nusing the driver framework. I will\n0:14\nassess what whether the capital\n0:17\nallocation creates genuine shareholder\n0:20\nvalue or simply transfers it considering\n0:23\nthe friction between the diverse\n0:25\nstakeholder incentives.\n0:28\nSo our first step is to define and\n0:31\ndiscover.\n0:33\nSo\n0:35\num the core problem is allocating the\n0:38\nexcess capital. Apple sits on 165\n0:41\nbillion in liquidity with a market\n0:45\ncontext of 30x PE ratio. I've mapped the\n0:50\ncritical shareholder constraints. So the\n0:54\nfirst constraint is the management and\n0:56\nemployees. Um the CEO holds 3 million\n0:59\nshares and the employees hold in options\n1:02\nwith a 170 strike price.\n1:06\nThey are highly sensitive to stock uh\n1:09\nprice drops. Um the second um constraint\n1:13\nis the shareholders.\n1:15\nThey want capital returns but retail\n1:17\ninvestors often prefer the uh steady\n1:19\nincome of dividends. And the third um\n1:22\nconstraint is\n1:25\num the conflict. So a 90 billion uh cash\n1:30\nalpha risk leverage but the main tension\n1:33\nis between the growth accusations and\n1:36\nthe buybacks and dividends. So my goal\n1:39\nis to determine a path that maximizes\n1:41\nthe risk uh adjusted value.\n1:46\nSo um in our represent phase\n1:49\num I have designed a plan to model the\n1:52\nthree scenarios to uh compare against\n1:55\nthe buybacks. So the buyback reducing\n1:59\nthe share count at current market\n2:01\nprices. Um second part of that is the\n2:05\nspecial dividend distributing the cash\n2:07\ndirectly. And the third step is the\n2:09\nstrategic acquisition. So investing in\n2:12\nhigh growth AI/VR assets.\n2:16\nSo I will use Python to model the EPS\n2:19\nimpact of each\n2:21\nuh spe uh spec specifically isolating\n2:25\nthe impact of lost interest income\n2:28\nversus the gain from share reduction or\n2:31\nbusiness synergies.\n2:34\nSo now we're in our implement stage. Um\n2:37\nI built the Python model to uh\n2:40\nparametize the decision. So um here you\n2:44\ncan see where I have uh in my inputs I\n2:49\nhave put my 90 uh billion dollar\n2:53\ndeployment size and a 4% um\n2:58\nuh opportunity cost on cash. Um I've\n3:02\ncalculated the loss interest um because\n3:06\nuh spending this cash means losing this\n3:08\nuh safety of risk-free interest income.\n3:12\nAnd then for the buyback, I reduced the\n3:14\nshare count by roughly 486 million\n3:16\nshares for the accusation.\n3:19\nAnd I'll assume that the cons uh assume\n3:22\na conservative 8% ROIC\n3:26\nwhich I have right here.\n3:29\nSo um running the model yields um yields\n3:34\nthese results. So after running it, this\n3:36\nis what I got. Um the buyback increases\n3:40\nEPS by roughly 3.2\n3:43\nto um\n3:45\nuh 6.37\n3:48\nuh dollars. Um the dividend actually\n3:50\ndilutes the EPS to five $5.98\n3:56\nright here. Uh because we lose the\n3:59\ninterest income but keep the uh the same\n4:02\nshare share account. And the accusation\n4:06\noffers the um highest potential EPS with\n4:10\nthe at $6.45\n4:13\nbut carries the highest\n4:15\nexecution risk which we can see. Um so\n4:20\nour next step is validate. So these\n4:23\nnumbers against theory\n4:26\nuh while the accusation looks great\n4:28\nmathematically we must consider the\n4:31\nagency cost. Um, a special dividend\n4:34\nwould drop the stock price by roughly $6\n4:36\nper share and the X dividend date\n4:40\nwith the employee options uh struck at\n4:44\n$170 and the current price at $185.\n4:48\nA a dividend pushes employees\n4:50\ndangerously close to being out of money.\n4:53\nSo therefore, the management and\n4:55\nemployees strongly prefer the buyback.\n4:57\nIt creates the price floor. However,\n5:00\nbuying back stock at uh P/E\n5:05\nof 30 is expensive and we are\n5:08\neffectively transferring value to the\n5:10\nshareholders who are selling rather than\n5:12\nuh rather than investing in the actual\n5:14\nbusiness. Despite this, the dividend\n5:17\noption signals a lack of growth ideas\n5:20\nwhich could compress the PP PE multiple.\n5:25\nSo how I could evolve this is uh so\n5:30\nbased on the data I can put my analysis\n5:32\ninto a final recommendation that Apple\n5:35\nshould proceed with the $90 billion\n5:38\nbuyback. So why I recommend that is that\n5:42\nthe incentive alignment it aligns with\n5:44\nthe CEOs and employee retention goals\n5:47\nkeeping the options in the money. Um\n5:51\nanother reason is the risk management\n5:54\nwhile AI accusation offers a higher\n5:56\ntheoretical EPS. Finding a target can\n5:59\nabsorb the 90 billion without antitrust\n6:02\nfailure is unlikely. And then another\n6:04\npart is flexibility. Unlike dividends\n6:07\nwhich is uh it's kind of sticky, a\n6:09\nbuyback can be paused if a better\n6:11\nstrategic opportunity arises.\n6:14\nSo to reflect on this,\n6:17\num this analysis highlights the\n6:20\ndifference between the accounting\n6:21\nmetrics and the real value. I learned\n6:24\nthat while buybacks increase EPS, um\n6:27\nthey don't really improve the product or\n6:29\nrevenue. However, in corporate finance,\n6:32\nsometimes the best decision is not um\n6:35\nthe most like efficient way to solve an\n6:39\nagency problem. Um the Python model\n6:41\nshowed me how to prove the dividends\n6:43\nwere mathematically inferior for the\n6:45\nEPS, solidifying the buy baskets.\n6:48Thank you."
