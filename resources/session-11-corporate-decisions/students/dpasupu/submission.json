  "transcript": "Hey, my name is Diana and this is my session 11 river analysis. So in the define and discover stage, I began by clarifying a core question which is should Apple execute a $90 billion buyback or would other alternatives like um a strategic acquisition, debt reduction, dividend or um increased research and development create more value for the company. So this question is important and it matters because a buyback of this size directly affects Apple's capital structure um as well as its financial flexibility um and the incentives of the shareholders management employees and bond holders. Um so the the main question the main issues I need to answer here were whether the buyback truly adds long-term value um and who is benefiting here and losing here and then how that decision aligns with key concepts such as leverage um and agency conflicts and financial flexibility. So things that are covered in this chapter.\n\nSo to set up the analysis, I gathered the relevant financial information. So Apple has 165 billion in cash and investments and generates roughly hundred billion in annual free cash flow. So it clearly has the capacity to fund a 90 billion buyback. Um, and with a $185 share price and a 15.5 billion with that many shares outstanding, I could estimate exactly how many shares the companies um would retire. Um, I also looked at the stakeholder positions, including Birkshshire Hathways, um, 6% ownership, a management's holdings, um, and employees with $170 strike options. Um so this is just going over the different metrics I need to quantify. So the shares repurchased, EPS effects, um leverage changes, ownership concentration, um and the stakeholder impacts.\n\nSo in represent I designed the overall um thought process or like analytical structure. So my plan was to evaluate all five capital allocation sorry options and share them using consistent metrics. So um EPS share count leverage ownership shifts and stakeholder incentives. Um and I made sure the assumptions in the model were completely transparent and easy to adjust so the analysis could be adapted in different scenarios. I also uh here mapped out the comparison framework. So financially I looked um at how each option affects EPS leverage um the cash levels um and the ownership concentration um and from a stakeholders perspective I examined how different groups responded based on their perspective incentives um and all of this connects to kind of the core concepts we discussed in in this chapter. So leverage amplifies risk and return. Um agency conflicts shape behavior. Um buybacks may shift value rather than create it. Um and market signals influence investor perception as well.\n\nSo um in the implement stage I created a prompt kind of walking through the define discover and reflect stages um to generate the Python code for my model and it's kind of walking through the different um financial relationships I need. So um shares retired, new share account, EPS before and after EPS um accretion and the leverage changes. And now I'm going to do a walk through and code analysis. So I'll run the code and it run successfully. So at the top of the script you can see all the um key assumptions. So the share price, the number of shares outstanding, um a net income, the total buyback amount, um and then Apple's existing debt. And this keeps everything transparent and then also easy to modify the numbers change. Um and next the script, um it calculates how many shares Apple can retire with 90 billion at a price of $185. um it then subtracts that from the original shares outstanding to get the new uh share count. Um and then after that the model computes EPS before and after the buyback as well as the percentage change in EPS. So I can see whether I I can do an analysis of the buyback. Um and then finally it calculates the equity before and after the buyback and uses those values to compute leverage which is debt divided by equity which tells me how Apple's financial risk shifts. Um and then oh and then all of the outputs are printed at the bottom. um making it like easy to interpret.\n\nSo these are the results or the output from the code. And looking at the results, um Apple would repurchase about 486 million shares, reducing the share count to roughly 15 billion. So EPS increases from $645 to about um $6.66, which is a 3.24% improvement. And this increase comes entirely from having fewer shares outstanding and not from any change in the out in from the income. Um the leverage increases slightly from 0 0384 to 0.0398. Um because the buyback reduces equity and uses cash that would otherwise support the balance sheet. So it's a small change but it does represent a measurable rise in the financial risk which is notable.\n\nSo now to transition to our financial checks. Um I checked all the calculations manually to make sure that they matched the model. Um so every result the shares repurchase EPS before and after EPS accretion and leverage. Um it was all consistent with the formulas uh we learned in class which is the ones that were in the code. Um and the numbers confirm that the buyback behaves exactly as expected. So BPS rises mechanically and leverage increases um modestly um so it's just findings. Um I also validated the stakeholder outcomes. Um so equity investors benefit from higher EPS and greater ownership concentration. Um management benefits because EPS based compensation improves. Um, and employees with $170 $170 strike options gain value as the buyback provides a price support. But um, bond holders however face slightly higher credit risk and that's due to reduced liquidity and the small increase in leverage. So these outcomes line up with the theory that mechanically PS accretion can reflect value transfer. Um as well as reduced cash limits flexibility and also distribution of benefits and risk reflects the like agency conflicts and the signaling effects as well that we covered in the chapter.\n\nSo next in this section um I compared the buyback to other capital allocation options. So a special dividend doesn't affect EPS and is taxable to shareholders. Um, debt reduction improves leverage and bond holder confidence but doesn't boost returns. Um, acquisitions may create value but carry execution risk. um an increased R&D um that spending helps long-term innovation but doesn't immediately reward the um the shareholders or investors. Um and the stakeholder summary shows that the buyback primarily benefits equity holders and management while bond holders absorb more of the the risk. Um so this this kind of like reinforces why capital structure decisions have to be evaluated through a multi- stakeholder lens.\n\nSo for the evolve stage I shifted my thinking as I integrated all the results. So early on I viewed the buyback mainly through its EPS impact. uh but validation showed that EPS alone doesn't measure the true value creation and additionally I also became more aware of the trade-off between providing immediate ch shareholder returns um and preserving the strategic flexibility. So that understanding helped me redefine my final recommendation which I'll go over at the end.\n\nSo now to reflect on the assignment, um I was surprised by how significantly the buyback affected Apple's flexibility. Um despite the company's massive cast cash cash position, um the numerical modeling was straightforward in this assignment, but interpreting what the results meant for the strategy and stakeholder incentives required a little bit of like deeper analysis on my part. So that was a little harder than expected. Um, the stakeholder mapping was simpler than I expected because the textbook lays out conflicts clearly. Um, but weighing those conflicts against Apple's long-term goals was more challenging as well. So if I repeated this analysis, I would run more scenarios and include more qualitative factors such as um market conditions and then here's it innovation timing.\nSo now to go to my final recommendation um it is to approve the buyback but only as a part of a balanced capital allocation strategy. So the buyback improves EPS. Um it increases ownership concentration and sends a strong signal to the market while keeping leverage at a pretty like manageable level. Um however, Apple should preserve a meaningful cash buffer um and maintain the governing governance safeguards to prevent the buybacks from artificially inflating performance metrics. Um and then continue heavily investing in research and development to sustain the long-term growth of the company. All right. Thank you."
