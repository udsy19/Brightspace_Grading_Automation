  "transcript": "This is the session 11 assignment. Um,\nwe're to evaluate Apple's hypothetical\n$90 billion share repurchase using\nDriver. We'll act as an independent\nanalyst who must determine whether the\nbuyback creates value relative to\nalternative uses of cash while balancing\nstakeholder incentives.\nSo the capital allocation snapshot the\nliquidity we have 165 billion in cash\nand investments 100 billion annual free\ncash flow\nuh the market context we have $185 share\nprice dividend yield how many shares are\noutstanding um\nso yeah the proposal is $90 billion\nbuyback of our stock executed over one\nyear and the alternatives uh $6 special\ndividend strategic ARVR acquisition debt\nreduction and incremental R&D\nuh we will deliver a recommendation that\nexplains stakeholder impacts, agency\nconsiderations and value creation versus\nvalue transfer outcomes.\nSo first part of driver define discover\nuh so Apple currently sits on 165\nbillion in liquidity and generates 100\nbillion in annual uh\nFCF with 15.5 billion shares of\noutstanding and share price of $185. The\ncompany is trading at a premium PE of\n30. Uh the problem statement so the\nearning yields of the buyback at 185 is\n3.3% and landscape where peers are\ndiverting massive capital toward AI\ninfrastructure. Apple's decision to\nrepurchase shares these levels must be\njustified against its opportunity cost\nspecifically the potential for\ntechnological\nlag in AI. So represent to weigh the\ntrade-offs uh the driver criteria\nagainst Apple's buy primary capital\nallocation alternatives.\nUm the $90 billion share repurchase a $6\nspecial dividend uh strategic IVR\nacquisition debt reduction or aggressive\nR&D expansion. So we'll implement uh the\nbuyback yield of 3.3% versus debt\ninterest. Uh repurchasing the shares at\n30 uh PE is expensive if interest rates\nare higher than this yield. That\nreduction or T bills would offer a\nsuperior immediate mathematical return.\nUh the strategic fit Apple follows a net\ncash neutral strategy. Returning cash\navoids empire building risks associated\nwith large uh dilutive acquisitions.\nThe incentives and stakeholder impact u\nbeneficial uh B institutional\nBirkshshire uh they're beneficial their\n6% ownership rises 6.2% taxree as their\nshare current shrinks by 3.1%.\nmanagement strong alignment with\nearnings per share based targets. Uh\nretail there's passive gain through\nearning per share growth but no\nimmediate cash flow which is a\ndisadvantage for income seekers.\nSo the value creation versus value\ntransfer value transfer buying back\nshares that appear a value of $185 per\nshare simply transferred cash from the\ncompany to existing uh exiting\nshareholders. The pie shrinks but\nintrinsic value per share is unchanged.\nvalue creation only occurs with the $185\nis an undervaluation of Apple's\nlong-term AI integrated ecosystem their\nstock price.\nSo this is just a comparison of the\nalternatives\nuh\nof what Apple can do.\nSo we have the earning per share impact\nthe ownership the\nROIC and signaling\nand so the finding is the buyback is the\nmost earnings per share uh equative move\nbut risk signaling that management lacks\nhigh return internal ideas for\ninnovation\nevolve and reflect final determination.\nThe $90 billion buyback is a defensive\nvalue transfer. While it satisfies\ninstitutional desire for tax efficiency\nand concentrates ownership, doing so at\na PE of 30 suggest a prioritization of\nfinancial engineering over\ntransformative growth.\nUm so for management 3 million share of\nstate gains, mechanical support\nperformance hurdles become easier to\nhit. The stock price support keeps $170\nstrike options highly profitable aiding\nretention for employees. Uh liquidity\nwill drop by 90 billion for bond holders\nand uh\nand net cash neutral target increase\nleverage ratios slightly but the 100\nbillion FCF remains a massive safety bus\nbuffer.\nSo the independent recommendation is\nproceed with $70 billion in repurchases\nto satisfy the capital return policy but\ndirect 20 billion to an aggressive uh\nstrategic AI infrastructure fund to\ncounter the market's perception of the\ninnovation under investment.\nThen we put this stuff into code\ninto collab and uh we'll have like our\nshares, our buyback, our debt, our cash,\nour tax rate, the debt cost, the ROC\ncurrent, the share price, the the price\nto earnings ratio, the\num you'll all run the code.\nThe debt reduction, there's an\nalternative\num the other alternative.\nSo after one year\nand then this all kicks out the net\nincome of 95.58 billion\nexcuse me the baseline EPS baseline\nmarket invested capital and this is the\ncollap output of quantitative scenario\nanalysis if we were to do this\nshares outstanding EPS change.\nSo, the buyback is probably the best\nthing that we can do,\nbut we could also\num\ngo into debt reduction to uh increase\nour EPS.But yeah, there's our assignment."
