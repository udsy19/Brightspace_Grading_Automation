  "transcript": "00:00\n My session 11 assignment.\n00:06\n So to begin, I used a combination of Gemini and my own thoughts to create recommendations\n00:12\n for this assignment.\n00:13\n So I'm going to be going through that now for you today.\n00:15\n So to begin, I put the textbook assignment into Google Gemini, and I'm going to walk\n00:19\n through this information.\n00:21\n So to begin with the Define and Discover stage, we're going to start with the problem definition,\n00:25\n which is that we're evaluating the proposed $90 billion Apple share repurchase against\n00:30\n alternative capital allocation strategies, which is special dividend acquisition, debt\n00:36\n reduction, R&D to determine the value creation slash transfer, optimal choice, and shareholder\n00:42\n impact.\n00:43\n So below here, we have some key data inputs, which I'm not going to read through.\n00:50\n And then below, it took those inputs and calculated some important assumptions and\n00:55\n discovery in order to solve our problem down the line.\n00:59\n So now going into the R or represent slash modeling stage, we have an analysis of the\n01:05\n comparative financial models to the five different scenarios.\n01:09\n So baseline, buyback, special dividend acquisition, debt reduction, and R&D investment.\n01:14\n So we can see here we have a couple of zeros, $90 billion, et cetera.\n01:19\n So required metrics to model is the new PS, the change in EPS, new leverage, and return\n01:24\n on investment capital, and then our shareholder is owned by our concentration change and equity\n01:30\n ratio.\n01:31\n In the implement stage, which is modeling and calculation, we have the assumptions and\n01:38\n simplifications, and then shown here, we have the scenario calculation for the six different\n01:43\n types of models.\n01:44\n So the key insight here is that the acquisition scenario offers the highest immediate EPS\n01:49\n uplift, assuming a strong 10% return.\n01:52\n The buyback provides a mechanical 3.24 EPS lift solely through share count reduction.\n01:59\n And leverage and capital structure metrics are shown here.\n02:03\n So scenario to the buyback impact is that the cash reduction and shareholder equity\n02:08\n reduction will slightly increase the DE, but the change will be minimal given the size\n02:13\n of the equity base.\n02:15\n Now for validate analysis and comparison, value creation versus value transfer.\n02:20\n Buyback, the EPS increase is a pure value transfer from the balance sheet to the income\n02:24\n statement unless the stock is undervalued or signaling.\n02:29\n So it returns capital to shareholders who now have a similar claim on the same 90.6\n02:34\n billion and I, boosting their share EPS, and there's no new value created.\n02:39\n So acquisition, if the 10% return is achieved, this is a clear value creation, the highest\n02:44\n potential value creation, but also the highest execution risk.\n02:48\n And then finally, the debt reduction, DR, the value creation through reducing future\n02:54\n interest expense and financial risk.\n02:56\n Lower financial risk slightly lowers the cost of equity.\n02:59\n So again, here is a stakeholder analysis broken down by different stakeholders and their impacts\n03:07\n within the problem.\n03:08\n So in the evolved, so our scenario adjustment, if the stock was overvalued, the optimal decision\n03:15\n would shift away from the buyback and increase the price to store shareholder value.\n03:22\n And then now I'm going to move over to this document and give my personal recommendations.\n03:26\n So now that Google Gemini has helped break down the assignment, I'm going to provide\n03:30\n my own conclusions and recommendations for this case.\n03:33\n So the first is to put effort into funding and being strategic, put effort and funding\n03:39\n into being strategic about research and development so that way Apple can highlight its value\n03:44\n creation.\n03:45\n And in addition, the buyback method as the default path for the 90 billion, this is because\n03:49\n M&A has a higher risk factor and the buyback is tax efficient and at a low risk use and\n03:55\n it matches with Apple's goals.\n03:57\n So overall, looking at AI's analysis, I have determined that the buyback option is the\n04:02\n strongest method for Apple's new business values.04:05"
