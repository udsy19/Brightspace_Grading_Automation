  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student covers primary stakeholders—shareholders (Berkshire, retail), management (CEO holdings), and bondholders/lenders—and briefly addresses employees with options. They also connect outcomes (EPS, leverage) to these groups in the Evolve discussion. This meets the completeness expectation for introductory-level coverage with adequate depth for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes clear procedural steps and numeric outputs from a Colab run and explicitly states that hand calculations match the code results, demonstrating executed and validated analysis. Although the actual Python code text is not shown, the combination of implemented workflow, specific results, and cross-check validation meets the introductory-level requirement and warrants PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Define/Discover stage with the problem, alternatives, key data, and stakeholders before describing the representation and implementation (equations and code). Given this clear, upfront D-stage followed by modeling, the criterion is met under the strict DRIVER standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discussed leverage qualitatively and measured debt-to-equity, but did not identify the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield) nor explicitly address increased financial risk or distress costs. Given the criterion requires both elements of the trade-off, the submission does not meet the standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and briefly identifies stakeholder winners/losers across options (shareholders, retail, employees, and indirectly bondholders via leverage), satisfying basic conceptual understanding. However, they do not analyze incentive divergence in depth nor explain asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks, leaving notable gaps for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links financing choices to returns via EPS effects and notes leverage matters to bondholders, with D/E computed. However, they do not explain that leverage amplifies losses or that debt adds fixed interest obligations increasing default risk. Coverage is basic and incomplete on the risk side, so this merits a partial pass.",
