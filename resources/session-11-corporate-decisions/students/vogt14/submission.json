  "transcript": "Okay, for the session 11 assignment, we will be starting now. We have the define and discover stage. First, we have the fact that Apple is considering a $9 billion share repurchase executed over one year, which is roughly 10% of its market cap. We need to determine whether this buyback creates value compared to the four alternatives, which are a $6 special dividend, a strategic AI slash VR acquisition, debt reduction, and incremental R&D investment. We must assess whether the buyback is financially sound, strategically aligned, and beneficial to stakeholders. So some information is Apple holds $165 billion in cash and investments and generates $100 billion of free cash flow annually and has a debt of $110 billion. We have market indicators such as the share price of 185, PE of 30, dividend yield of 0.5, and 15.5 billion shares outstanding. Our key stakeholders are Berkshire Hathaway, which owns 6%. CEO holds 3 million shares. Retail holders average 100 shares.\n\nEmployee hold options with $170 strike price. Bondholders are exposed to leverage changes. So the core questions we'll be answering are how does EPS ownership concentration change? leverage and signaling change under the buyback versus the four alternatives which stakeholder groups benefit or are harmed under each option and does the 90 buyback create real long-term value or simply just shift value between stakeholders so to represent this we have some equations laid out we have the shares repurchased and new share count shares repurchased will be found by 90 billion divided by 185 which will quantify eps changes ownership changes in stakeholder EPS calculation is net income over shares outstanding which is a core financial effect of the buyback and baseline for comparing alternatives. We have ownership concentration which can be found by stakeholder shares over new share count which shows how holders gain relative ownership after a buyback.\n\nWe have the leverage impact, which can be found by the debt to equity, which is $110 billion market cap, which is important for bondholders. We have a dividend alternative cost, which can be found by 6 times $15.5 billion, which compares cash use and per share benefit versus the buyback. So for our implement we use Gemini to create a code in Colab. Just to run through what each of these parts mean a bit. The first part we are going to get inputs from the user. The second part converts blank inputs to defaults. We then have the, it lays out the equations that we'll be using. And then we have the actual calculations of the equations. And then we have the printing of each cash flow section clearly, so just the results of the equations. And then it displays the final cash reconciliation and all the results at the end. So we're just going to run this real quick. Enter all of the base values, 185 share price, a 90 billion buyback cash amount, 15.\n\n5 billion shares outstanding, 100 billion net income, 110 billion total debt, and an annual dividend per share of 6, and then a 6% stakeholder ownership percentage. With these results, we get shares repurchased of $486 billion, a little over that. $486 billion, $486,000 with $486. And then a new share count of a little over $15 billion. Our EPS before buyback was $6.45, with after buyback of $6.66, which is an increase of $0.21. Stakeholders' old ownership of 6%, new ownership of 6.19%, which is an increase of 0.19%. Debt to equity before buyback was 0.04% and after buyback is also 0.04%. A total annual dividend cost alternative of $93 billion. So to validate these results, we laid out all the equations And I'll just run through a couple of them. So shares repurchased will be found by $90 billion over $185, which gives us the correct result, which matches with the code. New share count is shares outstanding minus shares repurchased, which is also matching with the code.\n\nOur EPS calculation before... And after are also accurate by hand calculated the same results in the code. Stakeholder ownership also matches up with the code. And debt to equity also matches up with the code. And then dividend alternative would be found by the 6 times the $15.5 billion, which also matches up with the code. So on the evolve stage, we're just going to run through basically what this means and how we can answer some of these questions. So buyback increases EPS around 3.3%, which signals a higher profitability per share, which could possibly influence stock prices. Existing shareholders benefit slightly from increased ownership percentage. Retail shareholders see a proportional increase in stake per share. Employees with options indirectly gain if the share price rises post buyback. Paying a $6 dividend would cost slightly more cash than the $90 billion buyback and does not reduce shares outstanding, so it wouldn't boost the EPS or ownership percentages.\n\nIt would just mainly transfer cash directly to shareholders without affecting market metrics. Debt reduction would improve leverage but doesn't affect EPS or ownership. And then the R&D slash acquisition could create long-term value if investments generate high return. but cash is tied up rather than returning value immediately to shareholders. Value creation is minimal with this, but some benefits go to continuing shareholders while employees may gain indirectly via option value. Overall, the buyback is mostly a value transfer among stakeholders with slight improvement to EPS. The buyback overall is reasonable but not optimal. I would say it's the best option just because it costs the least cash and puts the market metrics up while also getting the goal of what they want done. So for our reflect stage, we're just going to take a look. We could use this model to test different buyback sizes, compare different dividend policies, or evaluate leverage limits.\nWe could also use this to stress test stakeholder outcomes. More metrics to make this more accurate can be ROI for strategic alternatives, option value impact, share price sensitivity, and free cash flow per share before and after the buyback. The framework is flexible and can be used for any capital allocation decisions, not just buybacks. And that wraps up the Session 11 assignment."
