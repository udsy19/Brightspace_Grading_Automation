  "transcript": ":20\nHi there, my name is Bri. Um, today I'm\n0:22\ngoing to be evaluating Apple's\n0:24\nhypothetical $90 billion share\n0:26\nrepurchase proposal. So, my mandate is\n0:28\nto determine whether this buyback\n0:30\ncreates value relative to four\n0:32\nalternatives while balancing key\n0:33\nstakeholder incentives. Today I'm going\n0:36\nto be using the driver framework to\n0:37\nstructure the final analysis move from\n0:39\nproblem definition to a final datadriven\n0:42\nrecommendation. And so this begins with\n0:44\ndefine and discover. The problem is\n0:46\nclear. So it's does spending $90 billion\n0:48\non a buyback create intrinsic value for\n0:51\nApple or does it merely transfer\n0:52\nexisting value? So, our inputs are the\n0:55\ncompany's strong capital position, $165\n0:58\nbillion in cash, $100 billion in annual\n1:01\nFCF, and a market valuation of $185 per\n1:05\nshare with a PE of 30X. So, the BIR\n1:08\nproposal is a large one-year program\n1:11\nabout 10% of market cap. So based on\n1:13\nthis we move to the represent stage and\n1:17\nwe're building transparent um\n1:19\nparameterized model in Python to toggle\n1:22\nbetween five different scenarios of the\n1:25\n$90 billion share buyback which is the\n1:27\nproposal the six special dividend the\n1:32\n$90 billion strategic acquisition the\n1:34\n$90 billion debt reduction and the $90\n1:37\nbillion incremental R&D. So crucially we\n1:40\nset our value creation threshold for\n1:42\nApple's WACC which we assume is 8% and\n1:45\nan investment must yield 8% to genuinely\n1:48\ncreate value. So we execute the model in\n1:52\nthe implement stage and validate it. And\n1:55\nso\n1:57\nhere is just some of the code that I had\n2:00\nentered into Google Collab. Um and here\n2:03\nare the results I got.\n2:07\nSo the key metrics is the current cash\n2:09\nout is NA uh the shares 15.5 debt 110\n2:16\nyear 1 6.7 NA for the EPS change and\n2:20\nthen the DE ratio is 0.44\n2:23\num we just get some critical numbers in\n2:24\nhere where it's the buyback is 90 the\n2:27\nshare OS is 15.01 the debt is 110 year 1\n2:32\nis 6.37 and that's a plus 3.2% 2%. Um we\n2:37\nlook at the debt reduction is the cash\n2:39\nout of 90 billion. The shares is 15.5\n2:43\nbillion. The debt is 20 billion. Um year\n2:47\n1 EPS is 6.3 and the EPS change is a\n2:51\nplus 2.8% with a DE ratio of 0.08%.\n2:55\nSo that is just the comparison that we\n2:58\nhave here. But the buyback provides the\n2:59\nhighest immediate EPS increase at 3.2%.\n3:03\nHowever, observing that the debt\n3:05\nreduction alternative um is also very\n3:09\ngood option. And so by saving on $90\n3:11\nbillion, it yields a 2.8% EPS increase,\n3:15\nwhich is almost identical to the buyback\n3:17\nwhile reducing Apple's DE ratio from\n3:20\n0.44 to 0.08. So in this validate stage,\n3:25\nwe confirmed our findings of just\n3:28\nvalidating and verifying that the\n3:29\nbuyback EPS is purely mathematical. Um\n3:32\nthe debt reduction is the operational\n3:34\nand recurring driven in interest and\n3:36\nexpense. And the acquisition and R&D\n3:39\noptions show that no year one EPS change\n3:42\nbut offer substantial long-term growth\n3:44\nif their target ROIC's are achieved and\n3:49\njust evolving and the agency analysis.\n3:52\nUm it requires us to connect these\n3:55\nnumbers to the stakeholder incentives\n3:57\nand the addressing of the agency risks.\n4:00\nAnd so this is where the simple\n4:02\nqualitative um answer diverges from the\n4:04\nstrategic one. And\n4:10\nso we have that the retail and instit\n4:13\ninstitutional\n4:15\num have the buyback impact of high\n4:17\nshort-term price support. So the value\n4:19\nis transferred as Birkshshire's\n4:21\nownership rises. The debt reduction\n4:23\nimpact is low risk, moderate EPS. Uh\n4:27\nboosts improved safety profile and the\n4:29\nacquisition impact is the highest\n4:31\npotential long-term value creation.\n4:34\nManagement CEO is highly favorable. The\n4:36\nEPS boost directly increases the value\n4:39\nof the CEO's $3 million shares in the\n4:41\ncompany stock options. The debt\n4:43\nreduction impact is neutral, so there's\n4:45\nno immediate equity or gain, and the\n4:47\nacquisition impact is favorable for\n4:49\nlong-term legacy and strategic success.\n4:52\nAnd then for bond holders um the buyback\n4:54\nimpact is neutral or negative which the\n4:56\ncatch is just slightly reduced. The debt\n4:59\nreduction impact is most favorable\n5:01\nsignificantly deleveraging and it's\n5:04\nimproved credit rating and then the\n5:06\nacquisition impact for that would be\n5:07\nneutral. So the core of the analysis is\n5:09\nthe difference between value creation\n5:11\nand value transfer. The acquisition in\n5:14\nR&D 10 and 15% are true value creation\n5:17\noptions because of their marginal return\n5:20\nand how that exceeds Apple's WACCC of\n5:22\n8%.\n5:24\nThe buyback is primarily value transfer.\n5:26\nSo since Apple is trading at a high 30\n5:29\ntimes PE, the stock is unlikely to be\n5:31\nseverely undervalued. But the buyback\n5:33\nsimply redistributes cash to fewer\n5:35\nshares. So then this brings us to agency\n5:38\nrisk. The buyback carries the highest\n5:40\nagency risk because it's the option\n5:42\nthat's most directly aligned with\n5:43\nself-interest of management, which is\n5:45\nboosting options and stock value without\n5:47\nnecessarily improving the firm's\n5:49\noperations. The governance committee\n5:51\nmust treat this with skepticism.\n5:55\nBut going on to reflections and\n5:57\nrecommendations, um we're integrating\n6:00\nour findings to deliver the cohesive\n6:02\nrecommendation and that is the $90\n6:05\nbillion buyback is rejected. So, while\n6:07\nit offers the highest short-term EPS,\n6:10\nit's a poor strategic choice that\n6:11\ncarries high agency risk and it's\n6:13\nprimarily a value transfer mechanism.\n6:16\nSo, our analysis supports a balanced\n6:18\nhybrid approach that maximizes both\n6:20\nfinancial growth and long-term strategic\n6:23\ngrowth. And so, the final recommendation\n6:26\nwould be doing a hybrid plan. So, we\n6:28\nrecommend splitting the capital\n6:30\nallocation\n6:31\n$45 billion debt reduction. The\n6:34\njustification for this would be that it\n6:36\nprovides guaranteed risk-free 3.5%\n6:39\npre-tax and achieves significant\n6:41\nnecessary reduction and financial\n6:43\nleverage satisfying the bond holder and\n6:45\nimproving the long-term stability. And\n6:48\nso then the $45 billion strategic\n6:50\ninvestment that focuses on the true\n6:53\nvalue creation by funding um the\n6:56\ninitiatives of the promise returns from\n6:58\n10% to 15%.\n7:01\nAnd significantly above Apple's WACC. So\n7:04\nthis is critical for future competitive\n7:07\nadvantage. The hybrid model nearly\n7:09\nmatches the buyback short-term impact\n7:11\nwhile drastically reducing the leverage\n7:14\nand investing in the strategic future of\n7:17\nthe firm. So, it's the most disciplined\n7:20\nand value aligned with Apple's use of\n7:22\ncapital. Thank you."
