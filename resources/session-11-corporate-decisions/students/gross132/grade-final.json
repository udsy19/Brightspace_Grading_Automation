  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes concrete calculation steps (DPS, EPS, accretion, ROE, leverage), states they executed Python code with named libraries, and reports specific numeric outputs and generated visualizations, indicating code execution and result validation. Given the moderate standard allowing conceptual demonstration with clear steps and matching outputs, this meets the PASS requirements.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly frames the problem, objectives, stakeholders/market inputs up front and the student states they completed the D (define/discover) stage before implementation. Evidence shows the necessary problem statement and data were captured prior to modeling, meeting the strict requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documented the data inputs, scenarios, and calculation metrics before running code and then implemented those plans—producing heat maps, risk/reward graphs, and scenario outputs—demonstrating clear linkage from representation to implemented artifacts. This satisfies the requirement for representing approach, options, and data needs prior to implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies the interest tax shield concept via after-tax interest savings and qualitatively links lower leverage to lower risk, meeting both key points. However, the treatment is brief, lacks a clear articulation of the tax-benefit vs financial distress trade-off, and shows minor confusion about leverage metrics, so it does not reach the depth needed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student lists stakeholders and focuses on shareholder EPS preferences but does not identify who gains/loses under each option (e.g., bondholders vs shareholders, employees with options, large holders) or why incentives diverge. They also do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks. Thus, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student connects leverage to risk and recognizes interest as a fixed obligation via “interest saved,” but does not explicitly explain how leverage amplifies returns (EPS/ROE) and risks or discuss default risk. Coverage is correct but basic, with gaps in depth and clarity, so this meets a Partial rather than a Pass under the moderate standard.",
