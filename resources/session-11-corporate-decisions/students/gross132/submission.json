  "transcript": "0:02\nHello, my name is Riley Gross and today\n0:04\nwe'll be talking about corporate\n0:05\ndecisions and incentives.\n0:08\nAlong with that, we will be utilizing\n0:10\nPython as well as the driver framework\n0:13\nto help us work through the problem.\n0:16\nSo, going into how I use Gemini to give\n0:20\nme a Python script, I first said that\n0:22\nI'm a finance student studying corporate\n0:25\ndecisions and incentives. I want you,\n0:28\nmeaning Gemini, to make decisions and\n0:32\nhelp me specifically build a Python\n0:34\nscript that is going to calculate these\n0:37\ncorporate decisions and help me make the\n0:39\nbest decision possible for my company\n0:42\ngiven the\n0:45\ntypes of financing\n0:47\nthat we are given as well as the current\n0:49\nmarket conditions.\n0:52\nSo I additionally I told it all that\n0:55\ngive me the Python script you know\n0:57\ncomment on all the code as well as the\n1:00\nproblem here which is evaluate Apple's\n1:04\nhypothetical $90 billion share\n1:07\nrepurchase using the driver framework\n1:10\nand I'm going to basically act as\n1:13\nsomeone who is independently analyzing\n1:16\nthis and finding out whether the buyback\n1:19\ncreates value relative to alternative\n1:21\nalternative uses of cash while also\n1:23\nbalancing the stakeholder incentives\n1:26\nwhich the company should also prioritize\n1:30\nor definitely keep of importance because\n1:33\nstakeholders are very important and help\n1:36\ndrive the company. Additionally, we have\n1:38\nthe capital allocation which is going to\n1:41\nhelp us with our calculations. So the\n1:43\nliquidity wise is 165 billion in cash\n1:47\nand investments 100 billion annual free\n1:50\ncash flow. The market context this Apple\n1:53\nshare is selling at $185 per share. The\n1:59\nprice to equity is 30. The dividend\n2:01\nyield is.5%.\n2:03\nAnd there's 15.5 billion shares\n2:06\noutstanding. In terms of the balance\n2:09\nsheet, there's $10 billion in debt.\n2:12\nBirkshshire owns 6% of that. The CEO\n2:16\nholds three million shares and retail\n2:20\ninvestors on average own 100 shares. And\n2:24\nthen a employees have $170 strike\n2:27\noption. And then the proposal is the $90\n2:30\nbillion buyback executed over a single\n2:33\nyear, which is 10% of the market cap for\n2:37\nApple\n2:39\nin this specific scenario. And then\n2:41\nlastly, the alternatives would be a $6\n2:44\nspecial dividend as well as uh strategic\n2:47\nAI/VR acquisition,\n2:50\ndebt reduction, and incremental research\n2:53\nand development.\n2:56\nSo, I'm going to be going to the Python\n2:59\ncode um in a second to help us calculate\n3:03\nthis, but first I'm going to go to the\n3:06\ndriver framework. So we have done the\n3:08\nfirst stage the D or the define and\n3:11\ndiscover of the driver framework. We\n3:13\nassess the problem. What specific things\n3:17\ndo we need to or like what is the entire\n3:21\nproposal of it? We also represented. So\n3:25\nwe showed what numbers we are going to\n3:28\nuse.\n3:30\nAnd now we're going to be moving on to\n3:32\nthe implement stage which is going to be\n3:33\nutilizing Python.\n3:36\nSo I've already ran my code. Um but\n3:41\nbasically here we're going to be using\n3:42\nsome pandas numpy mapplot lib and\n3:44\nseabour for some of the visualizations\n3:48\nas well as handling the data and\n3:51\ncalculations.\n3:52\nSo the first thing we see here is the\n3:58\nmarket conditions which I already talked\n4:01\nabout just the you know cash balance\n4:04\nbeing 165 billion the debt was 110\n4:08\nbillion etc.\n4:10\nBut most important thing here is the\n4:13\ncalculations side of things. So the\n4:17\nspecial dividend calculating that or\n4:19\ndividends per share we would take that\n4:21\ncash used divided by the shares\n4:23\noutstanding and then the predicted price\n4:25\nwould be the share price minus the DPS\n4:28\nthat we just calculated.\n4:32\nUm and then predicted price can also\n4:36\nequal the share price times 1 plus the\n4:38\nsignal impact. Next earnings per share\n4:41\nor EPS is just the new income that we\n4:45\nhave calculated divided by the new\n4:47\nshares.\n4:49\nAccretion um which is the dilution\n4:54\npercent um based on the EPS. We take the\n4:58\nnew EPS divided by the base EPS and then\n5:01\ndivide that by the base EPS times 100.\n5:03\nIt's going to give us a percentage. The\n5:05\nreturn on equity is just the net income\n5:09\ndivided by the new equity.\n5:12\nSo we can see our return. The leverage\n5:14\nratio is just the total debt divided by\n5:17\nthe net income. And it's in this case is\n5:20\na proxy for earnings before interest\n5:24\ntax.\n5:27\nAnd here we have our next in the code we\n5:30\nhave our scenarios. So the status quo\n5:33\nwhich would be keeping cash. The second\n5:36\noption or scenario would be buying back\n5:39\nall of those shares. And we would assume\n5:42\na market signal of plus two points.\n5:46\nAnd then the next would be the special\n5:48\ndividend.\n5:49\nAnother would be acquisition. So\n5:52\nexpanding upon these specific scenarios,\n5:56\nwe're looking into other alternatives\n5:58\nthat could also help and see if those\n6:01\nwould make us more money or be a better\n6:03\ninvestment for the in the long run. And\n6:05\nthen the last one would be the debt\n6:08\npayown. So we would see the interest\n6:11\nsaved, which would be the allocation\n6:13\namount times the rate and then times\n6:17\nthat by one minus the corporate tax\n6:19\nrate.\n6:22\nAnd then now we're going to be going to\n6:25\nthe\n6:27\noutput and what we calculated. So for\n6:29\nthe status quo or keeping the cash, we\n6:33\nhad an earnings per share of 6.26,\n6:36\nan accretion of 1.49,\n6:39\nshare price of $185, a leverage of 1.13,\n6:44\nand then optimal value of 7.5 billion.\n6:48\nNow we did all these calculations that I\n6:51\njust mentioned for all of these.\n6:55\nSo kind of looking at this holistically\n7:00\nuh accretion is good for the earnings\n7:05\nper share\n7:07\nand looking at the earnings per share of\n7:10\nall of these are all pretty similar. So\n7:13\nwe need to look into not only the share\n7:16\nprice but also the leverage and the\n7:20\nvaluation of these.\n7:23\nSo I had my Python script make both a\n7:26\nheat map and a risk to leverage reward\n7:31\ngraph which\n7:35\nyou could also\n7:37\ncalculate the\n7:40\nthe riskto-reward\n7:43\nof the specific\n7:46\ntype of option this company would go\n7:48\nwith.\n7:50\nthis heat map we see that the the\n7:53\nhighest for each category. So the share\n7:56\nprice goes to acquisition, the option\n7:58\nvalue goes to or valuation goes to\n8:01\nacquisition and the earnings per share\n8:03\ngoes to acquisition\n8:05\nand the return on equity is also uh or\n8:10\nthe return on equity. The problem with\n8:12\nacquisition is how high it that it is.\n8:16\nWhen you look at the status quo\n8:19\nor the cash payment, it is the lowest.\n8:23\nBut looking at it in terms of a\n8:26\nriskto-reward, what are we getting out\n8:28\nof it? What are the shareholders getting\n8:30\nout of it? We see two stand out. One,\n8:34\nthe acquisition\n8:36\nbecause simply because the riskto-reward\n8:40\nis so high. There's it's insanely risky.\n8:43\nNot the riskiest on here, but it's\n8:44\ninsanely risky,\n8:46\nbut the reward is so high. So, this\n8:49\ncould benefit the shareholders\n8:52\nsignificantly, but there's also a lot of\n8:54\nrisk.\n8:56\nSo, we need to compare and contrast to\n9:00\nthe other also really good option, which\n9:03\nis the debt down payment. Now the reason\n9:06\nthat this is so good is because the\n9:09\nleverage ratio is so low which meaning\n9:12\nthere's not as much risk. The payback\n9:14\nperiod is not as long acquisition the\n9:17\npayback period or buyback period is a\n9:20\nlot longer which is part of its risk.\n9:22\nThe debt the debt payown\n9:26\nwould not be as much.\n9:30\nSo, and we would get a really good\n9:33\nreturn.\n9:35\nBut in terms of shareholder value, we\n9:38\nwant to\n9:40\nmake sure that they're getting the\n9:43\nmost optimal outcome and maximizing\n9:46\ntheir returns. So, with that being said,\n9:49\nI would recommend going with the\n9:52\nacquisition option on this specific\n9:56\num\n9:58\nin this specific problem. But if we look\n10:01\nand compare the original to the buyback\n10:05\nand the dividend, I would significantly\n10:08\nsuggest the buyback because that is\n10:11\ngoing to increase our EPS a significant\n10:14\namount more than giving out that special\n10:17\ndividend. Just looking at this graph\n10:19\nhere, we can see that the dividend has a\n10:23\nlot of uh risk and not much reward. The\n10:27\nbuyback also has a lot of risk more more\n10:30\nso than the acquisition,\n10:32\nbut it is still a much better option\n10:35\nthan going with the dividend. Being able\n10:37\nto increase your earnings per share\n10:40\ndefinitely keeps the shareholder in mind\n10:43\nand is a good corporate decision to\n10:47\nmake.\n10:49\nSo just kind of summarizing all of this\n10:52\nand going back to our driver framework.\n10:54\nWe have now implemented, we have\n10:56\nvalidated, we looked and looked at our\n10:59\ncalculations, see what our output was.\n11:02\nWe even evolved. We looked at different\n11:05\nopportunities or different ways that the\n11:08\ncompany could go about this. Instead of\n11:10\ndoing a buyback, we looked at\n11:11\nacquisitions or a debt payown, for\n11:14\nexample. And then lastly, the final\n11:17\nrecommendation if we're strictly looking\n11:20\nat\n11:22\nthe two options available to us in those\n11:25\nwhich were the buyback of the a\n11:29\nrepurchase of the stocks\n11:32\nor the special dividend payout to\n11:35\nshareholders. the best for them would be\n11:39\nthe repurchasing or buyback of stocks\n11:42\nbecause that's going to increase their\n11:44\nearnings per share. But in terms of\n11:47\ntotal riskto-reward and maximizing the\n11:50\nportfolios of\n11:52\nour shareholders, it would be the\n11:55\nacquisition option.\n11:57\nSo now we have done all six steps of the\n12:00\ndriver framework and just finished the\n12:02\nreflection stage. I hope you learned\n12:05\nmore about corporate decisions and\n12:07\nincentives. Thank you."
