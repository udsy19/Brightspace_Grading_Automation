  "transcript": "0:02\nSo what I started out with was uh\n0:03\nprompting the chat box. So what I\n0:06\ninputed was I'm an accounting student uh\n0:08\ndoing an analysis over corporate\n0:10\ndecision and incentives. I told it to\n0:13\nplease act as a finance professional\n0:14\nwith a good understanding of Python and\n0:16\nthe definitions and concepts below. I\n0:19\nalso let it know to use the KISS\n0:21\nprinciple or the keep it simple stupid\n0:23\nprinciple on the code.\n0:26\nAnd then I I then inputed the assignment\n0:28\noverview.\n0:29\num and all like the specific and\n0:31\ntechnical requirements to let it know\n0:32\nwhere I wanted um to go with this\n0:35\nanalysis like I let it know the\n0:37\nobjectives and just all the necessary\n0:39\ninformation needed for it to\n0:41\nsuccessfully complete this uh analysis.\n0:44\nUm and then I I let it know after the\n0:45\nanalysis um I wanted to I wanted it to\n0:48\ncreate a summary um as if I would be\n0:50\npresenting this uh to to a beginner.\n0:54\nSo for part one uh the strate the\n0:56\nstrategic recommendation that me and the\n0:59\nuh uh Gemini came up with was to approve\n1:03\nthe $90 billion buyback but pair it with\n1:05\nthe guidance of R&D. So the rationale is\n1:08\nApple's currently over capitalized. It's\n1:11\nholding 1665\n1:13\nbillion in cash earning low returns.\n1:17\num holding $165 billion in cash earning\n1:20\nlow returns is inefficient when the core\n1:22\nbusiness generates a hundred billion a\n1:24\nyear and $90 billion buyback creates\n1:27\nvalue by optimizing optimizing the\n1:29\ncapital structure reducing weighted\n1:31\naverage cost of capital or the WACC that\n1:33\nwe learned a couple weeks ago and\n1:35\nreturning excess cash to shareholders\n1:37\nwho can reallocate it elsewhere.\n1:40\nHowever, uh the price to earnings ratio\n1:42\nis high about 30 times higher. Um the\n1:45\nbuyback is expensive. It signals the\n1:47\nmanagement believes the stock is uh\n1:49\nstill undervalued or that organic growth\n1:51\nopportunities\n1:53\num are saturated. To mitigate the\n1:55\nsignaling risk risk that the growth is\n1:57\ndead, management must simultaneously\n2:00\nreaffirm commitment to high return on\n2:02\ninvestment.\n2:05\nAnd for the financial and stakeholder\n2:07\nanalysis, uh first of all, the\n2:10\nstakeholder outcomes and agency costs.\n2:11\nSo management or the CEO with 3 million\n2:14\nshares uh the there's a positive impact\n2:17\nbuyback by buy excuse me buybacks uh\n2:20\nreduce the share count artificially\n2:22\ninflating earnings per share since\n2:24\nexecutive bonuses are often tied to\n2:25\nearnings per share targets. This\n2:27\nincentivizes the CEO to choose buybacks\n2:30\nover riskier uh agency cost.\n2:34\nSo employees um options at $170 strike.\n2:38\nSo there's is also a positive impact.\n2:40\nBuying$90 billion dollars of stock\n2:42\ncreates buyside pressure supporting the\n2:44\nstock price. This keeps their options in\n2:47\nthe money. For retail investors, um the\n2:50\naverage of about a 100 shares, uh\n2:52\nthere's a neutral to positive impact.\n2:53\nThey gain a slightly larger slice of the\n2:55\nownership pie tax-free. Um unlike\n2:58\ndividends, however, they rely on\n3:00\nmanagement um not overpaying for the\n3:03\nstock at $185.\n3:05\nfor Birkshshire institutional at a 6%\n3:08\nstake. Uh there's also again a positive\n3:11\nimpact. Their percentage ownership\n3:12\nincreases without them spending a dime.\n3:15\nWarren Buffett historically prefers\n3:16\nbuybacks for this taxefficient ownership\n3:18\nconcentration. And for bond holders, the\n3:21\nimpact is neutral. While $90 billion\n3:24\nleaves the balance sheet, Apple's\n3:25\nremaining liquidity um about 70 75\n3:28\nbillion plus 100 billion annual FCF or\n3:31\nfinancial cash flows is so massive that\n3:34\ncredit risk does not meaningfully\n3:35\nincrease.\n3:38\nUm and second is value creation versus\n3:41\nvalue transfer. The buyback or the value\n3:43\ntransfer mechanically this is financial\n3:45\nengineering. You are swapping cash for\n3:48\nshares. It transfers value from the\n3:49\ncompany account to uh exiting\n3:52\nshareholders. It only creates value if\n3:54\nthe shares are undervalued at $185.\n3:58\nAnd for R&D and acquisition or value\n4:00\ncreation um investing in AR/VR creates\n4:04\nnew economic value products revenue and\n4:06\nstream or products uh revenue streams.\n4:09\nHowever, these are high risk. If the\n4:11\nreturn on invested capital or ROIC of\n4:14\nthe acquisition is greater than the cost\n4:16\nof capital, it destroys value.\n4:19\nNumber three, the alternatives. Um,\n4:23\nso special dividend or $6 per share. The\n4:26\npros is it's immediate cash to\n4:28\nshareholders. The cons is tax\n4:30\ninefficient for taxable accounts. Stock\n4:32\nprice drops by dividend amount\n4:33\nimmediately.\n4:35\nUm, we have a strategic acquisition\n4:38\napproach. The pros for that are\n4:40\npotential for high growth and strategic\n4:42\ndominance. The cons are high execution\n4:44\nrisk. Most M&A fails um and regulatory\n4:48\nscrutiny is high for Apple right now.\n4:51\nAnd then finally uh debt reduction. So\n4:54\nthe pros are lower interest expense,\n4:56\ncons are pointless. I mean Apple already\n4:59\nhas negative net debt. Cash is greater\n5:01\nthan debt. Paying off cheap debt is\n5:03\ninefficient capital allocation.\n5:06\nAnd you can see that I have a uh I\n5:09\ncreated a spreadsheet to show all of\n5:10\nApple's just kind of like scenario. So\n5:12\nwe have the earnings per share, share\n5:14\nprice, net debt, leverage, and shares\n5:16\nout kind of with everything going on\n5:18\nright here. And you can see the buyback\n5:19\nthat we chose to do has about $6.66\n5:23\nuh earning EPS. Um 100 about almost $200\n5:27\nshare price 199.78.\n5:30\nUm it looks like they have 35 in net\n5:33\ndebt. uh the the a leverage ratio is\n5:36\nabout 0.27 and the shares outstanding\n5:38\nare about 15.01\n5:41\nand I created a little analysis. So EPS\n5:44\num\n5:46\nthe EPS winner of the acquisition\n5:48\ntheoretically drives the highest uh\n5:50\nearnings per share $6.85.\n5:52\nIf they can achieve a 10% return the\n5:54\nbuyback is the second best $6.66\n5:57\nand is much lower risk than an\n5:59\nacquisition\n6:00\nthe leverage check. So even after\n6:02\nspending about $90 billion, the buyback,\n6:05\nthe dividends, or the acquisition, the\n6:06\nleverage is only uh 27x. This is\n6:10\nincredibly safe. Most companies operate\n6:12\nhappily at uh 2x or 3x leverage. So this\n6:16\nproves the buyback does not endanger the\n6:17\ncompany solveny. For the share price,\n6:20\nthe buyback drives price to about $200,\n6:22\nassuming uh price to equity holds. And\n6:25\nfinally, the dividend. So mechanically\n6:27\ndrops to about 179. So the price minus\n6:30\ndividend and this looks bad on a chart\n6:33\nbut is mathematically neutral for the\n6:34\ninvestor because they have the cash in\n6:36\ntheir pocket.\n6:40\nAnd then finally we have the uh oh you\n6:43\nsee um we have the beginner summary. So\n6:47\nso imagine Apple is just a giant pizza\n6:49\ncut into about 15.5 billion slices. So\n6:52\nas a shareholder you own some of those\n6:54\nslices. The company has a massive pile\n6:56\nof extra cash, $165 billion, sitting in\n6:59\nthe bank that it doesn't need for daily\n7:01\noperations. They have a few choices on\n7:03\nwhat to do with it, the buyback or the\n7:06\nproposal. So, Apple uses the cash to buy\n7:08\nback slices from other people and throws\n7:10\nthem away. Now, there are fewer slices\n7:12\ntotal. Your slice essentially gets\n7:14\nbigger or you own a larger percent of\n7:16\nthe company without you spending a\n7:18\npenny. This usually makes the stock\n7:20\nprice go up. For the dividend, Apple\n7:22\njust gives you the cash on top of your\n7:24\nslice. You get money now, but your slice\n7:26\nof the pizza stays the same size. And\n7:29\nfor acquisition, Apple uses the cash to\n7:31\nbuy better ingredients or a new oven,\n7:34\nhoping the pizza becomes more valuable\n7:36\nin the future. This is riskier. What if\n7:38\nthe new oven breaks? In our conclusion,\n7:41\nwe re we recommend the buyback. Apple is\n7:44\nuh generating so much cash uh that it\n7:46\ncan afford to buy back its own stock and\n7:48\nstill invest in new technology. This\n7:50\nkeeps the stock price healthy and\n7:52\nrewards loyal shareholders like you."
