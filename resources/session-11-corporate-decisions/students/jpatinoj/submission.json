  "transcript": "0:01\nHello everyone. My name is Javier Patino\n0:03\nand this is my uh driver analysis of\n0:07\nApple's $90 billion share repurchase\n0:10\nproposal. My goal is to evaluate whether\n0:12\nthe buy the buyback creates real value\n0:14\ncompared to other users other users\n0:16\nother uses of Apple's cash and how each\n0:19\nchoice affects different stakeholder\n0:20\ngroups. So my defer discover to start I\n0:24\ndefine the core decisions decision\n0:25\nproblem. Apple currently has 15.5\n0:28\nbillion dollars in shares um uh\n0:32\noutstanding a share price of 185 and\n0:36\naround 100 billion in net income and a\n0:39\nstrong net cash uh position at about 55\n0:42\nbillion insane. The question is, should\n0:46\nApple spend $90 billion on a buyback or\n0:49\nwould a special dividend, paying down\n0:51\ndebt, a strategic AI or VR acquisition\n0:53\nor an additional research and\n0:55\ndevelopment um create more value. So I\n0:58\nidentified four main stakeholders\n0:59\naffected by this. Retail stakeholders,\n1:02\ninstitutional uh shareholders like\n1:04\nBirkshshire, um employees with stock\n1:06\noptions, and then managements who\n1:09\nmanagement whose incentives are tied to\n1:10\nEPS. Um and then finally we have bond\n1:14\nholders who are sensitive to Apple's\n1:16\nliquidity and leverage.\n1:18\nSo down here from my represent um before\n1:21\nbuilding the model I mapped out a\n1:23\nstructure. Um each scenario will\n1:24\ncalculate EPS\n1:26\nuh implied share price uh net cash\n1:30\nleverage ownership concentration and a\n1:32\nqualitative uh interpretation of value\n1:35\ncreation versus value transfer. Uh I\n1:37\nalso planned uh two visuals\n1:40\num one comparing EPS across scenarios\n1:42\nand one comparing Apple's net cash\n1:44\nposition. EPS uh represents shareholder\n1:47\nand management incentives while net cash\n1:49\nrepresents uh financial risk which is uh\n1:52\nimportant for bond holders and credit\n1:53\nagencies. So then my implementation\n1:55\nsection\n1:57\num you see right here um I I implemented\n2:02\nthe full model uh into into a one collab\n2:05\ncell right here. As you can see um I\n2:07\nused chat to come up with some code uh\n2:09\nto create uh my table for me. Uh so\n2:14\nas you can see, Apple retires uh about\n2:16\n400 uh 486 million shares\n2:21\nuh 46 sorry 46 oh my gosh 486 million\n2:26\nshares which raises EPS from 6 uh 645\n2:32\nlike 645 or 6.45 to a 6.66. So this is a\n2:37\n3% boost. the Apple uh net cash drops\n2:41\nfrom uh 55\n2:44\nuh so from 55 billion to negative 35\n2:48\nbillion uh which is something we do not\n2:50\nwant. Um flipping the company into net\n2:52\ndebt the ownership concentration\n2:54\nincreases uh by about 3%.\n2:57\num\n3:00\nunder the $6 billion uh oh no sorry\n3:04\nunder the $6 special dividend um EPS\n3:07\nstays the same but Apple again loses\n3:09\nnearly 90 billion in liquidity uh as you\n3:12\ncan see here uh and under debt uh\n3:17\nreduction EPS goes slightly uh goes up\n3:20\nslightly because Apple saves on interest\n3:22\nsaves on interest and Apple ends with a\n3:25\nvery strong net cash position of around\n3:29\nof around uh positive uh 55 billion\n3:33\nuh in the acquisition scenario assuming\n3:35\na 10% uh ROIC\n3:38\nuh EPS jumps uh above $7. It jumps above\n3:43\n$7 uh which is the highest of all cases\n3:46\nand this is a real value creation if\n3:48\nApple uh can actually uh earn that\n3:51\nreturn. Uh and then finally in the\n3:53\nincremental\n3:54\nuh R&D scenario there's a 3% jump um\n3:58\ninto the next uh into the net income um\n4:01\nin the net income which raises the EPS\n4:04\nto about six uh 66 660.5 so just it goes\n4:08\nup um higher um and supporting long-term\n4:11\nthis also supports long-term innovation\n4:13\nthe scenario table plots uh show uh\n4:16\nthese differences clearly so for my\n4:19\nvalidation section I validated the model\n4:21\nby checking uh that the outputs have\n4:24\nconsistency. Um\n4:27\nalso hold on let me let me make sure you\n4:29\nguys can see both of these.\n4:32\nOkay, I validated the model by checking\n4:34\nthat the outputs behave consistently. Uh\n4:36\n3% EPS uplift under buybacks matches the\n4:39\nnumber of shares retired. Um debt\n4:42\nreduction uh improves net cash and risk\n4:46\nuh exactly as expected and higher or ROI\n4:50\nuh C increases EPS in a proportional way\n4:53\nuh in the acquisition scenario. Um these\n4:56\nchecks confirm that the model is\n4:57\ninternally consistent and financially\n4:59\nrealistic. And just to show you again,\n5:01\nhere are my graphs. Um, with a higher uh\n5:04\nEPS um the higher EPS with the\n5:09\nacquisition being um the highest and\n5:12\nthen we have a we have uh the highest\n5:16\num net cash impact of capital allocation\n5:20\nscenarios uh for debt reduction up here.\n5:23\nSo to evolve my analysis uh\n5:28\nto evolve my analysis I noted I noted\n5:31\nthat uh\n5:33\nthat the full that the multi-year\n5:36\nprojection could layer in future free\n5:38\ncash flows uh potential multiple\n5:40\nexpansion and long-term uh return in uh\n5:43\nnot return uh research and development\n5:44\npayoffs. Um, I could also incorporate\n5:46\nhow management compensation tied to EPS\n5:49\nmight bias them towards uh buybacks even\n5:53\nif\n5:55\nmore fundamental value. Um, and some of\n5:57\nour reflect section I would say my final\n5:59\nrecommendation is a a blended approach.\n6:01\nSo um a smaller buyback uh for capital\n6:04\nreturn uh some debt reduction to keep\n6:07\nApple's balance sheet strong um and\n6:10\nincremental and an incremental uh\n6:13\nresearch and development investment to\n6:14\nsupport long-term innovation because\n6:16\nthat's that's something that's very\n6:17\nimportant especially to a company like\n6:18\nApple which um strives in um being one\n6:22\nof the longest uh longest uh successful\n6:26\ncompanies um tech companies in the in\n6:29\nthe world. Um so the buyback alone\n6:32\nmostly transfers value by boosting EPS\n6:34\nand ownership concentration. It doesn't\n6:37\ncreate as much true long-term value as\n6:39\nacquisition and uh research development\n6:40\noptions. So the most challenging part of\n6:42\nthis assignment was separating value\n6:44\ncreation from from value shifting. Uh\n6:47\nand the driver framework helped me do\n6:48\nthat in a structured way where we kind\n6:50\nof just get a little bit of both best of\n6:52\nboth worlds. So uh thank you for\n6:54\nwatching. Um this is um my driver\n6:58\nanalysis and yeah thank you for\n7:00watching."
