  "transcript": "0:03\nHello. I'll be doing uh the session 11\n0:06\nassignment today and uh we're going to\n0:08\nget straight to it. Um it says\n0:10\nassignment overview evaluate Apple's\n0:13\nhypothetical 90 billion dollars share\n0:17\nrepurchase uh using driver act as an\n0:19\nindependent analyst who must determine\n0:22\nwhether the buyback creates value\n0:23\nrelative to alternative use uses of cash\n0:27\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\n0:29\nUm the capital allocation snapshot is\n0:31\nthe liquidity which is at $165 billion\n0:35\ncash and investments and $100 100\n0:37\nbillion annual free cash flow market\n0:40\ncontext of 185 share price P& 30\n0:45\ndividend yield of 0.5% by 15.5 billion\n0:48\nshares outstanding the balance sheet of\n0:51\n100 and 10 billion uh of depth\n0:54\nBirkshshire owns 6% co holds 3 million\n0:57\nshares retail investors average 100\n1:00\nshares. Employees have 170 strike\n1:03\noptions.\n1:05\nProposal is $90 billion buyback executed\n1:08\nover one year which uh equals roughly\n1:11\nequals 10% of market cap. Alternatives\n1:13\nare $6 special dividend strategic AI/VR\n1:17\nacquisition debt production incremental\n1:20\nR&D. So I uh for this one I did it\n1:23\ndifferently and I did everything Google\n1:25\nslides. So we're just going to go\n1:26\nthrough the presentation that I did.\n1:30\nAnd so\n1:33\nthe problem is the central division or\n1:36\nthe central decision Apple faces is how\n1:38\nto allocate $90 billion of capital in a\n1:41\nway that maximizes long-term shareholder\n1:44\nvalue while aligning the incentives of\n1:45\nmanagement, retail, and institutional\n1:47\ninvestors, employees with options, and\n1:50\nbond holders. The question is, does a\n1:53\n$90 billion\n1:55\nbuyback create true economic value or\n1:58\ndoes it merely redist redistribute value\n2:01\nbetween stakeholders?\n2:03\nThe the variables in this scenario are\n2:06\nthe 185 share price, the 100 billion\n2:09\nfree cash flow, the 165 billion in cash,\n2:12\nthe 15.5 billion shares outstanding, the\n2:15\nP& of 30, the 110 billion that's an\n2:19\nexisting depth, the buyback proposal\n2:21\nthat equal to roughly 10% of market cap\n2:24\nand the alternatives that include a\n2:25\nspecial dividend, a strategic AI/VR\n2:27\nacquisition debt redu reduction or\n2:30\nincremental RD.\n2:32\nAnd some information is that\n2:35\nEPS impact from share account reduction.\n2:39\nUm these are what need to be uh what uh\n2:42\nI need to analyze. Um and the leverage\n2:46\nchanges from cash de uh deployment\n2:48\nstakeholder specific outcomes signaling\n2:51\neffects ROIC of alternatives uses of\n2:54\ncapital agency issues surrounding\n2:56\nexecutive incentives and investor\n2:58\npreferences.\n2:59\nUm these are the stakeholders. Retail\n3:02\nshareho shareholders that hold 100\n3:04\nshares each. The institutional holders\n3:07\nthat include uh Birkshshire with 6% CEO\n3:10\nwith 3 million shares. Employees holding\n3:13\noptions with the $170 strike price. Uh\n3:16\nthe bond holders that are concerned with\n3:18\nleverage and ratings. Um each group\n3:20\nexperiences the buyback differently. So\n3:22\nquantifying their incentives is\n3:24\nessential.\n3:25\nSo the approach that it took is\n3:29\nis that the model it it has includes\n3:32\nparameters for share count reduction,\n3:33\nEPS effects, net income rollover, depth\n3:36\nand cash levels, dividend scenarios,\n3:38\nacquisition synergies, long-term R&D\n3:40\nreturns and this enables scenario\n3:43\ntoggles so we can compare outcomes\n3:45\nacross all capital allocation choices.\n3:48\nUm the baseline metrics\n3:52\nis before before we do the scenario I\n3:54\nhad to act uh we calculate the Apple's\n3:56\nbaseline. So their net income is $95.6\n3:58\nbillion. The APS is $6.17 uh the market\n4:02\ncap is two $2.87 trillion. Net leverage\n4:06\nis roughly 1.15. Um and these baseline\n4:10\nvalues allow comparison across\n4:12\nscenarios.\n4:14\nUm, the scenarios are buyback funded\n4:16\nentirely with cash, special dividend of\n4:18\n$6 per share, debt reduction of $90\n4:21\nbillion, strategic AR/ VR accusation\n4:24\ngenerating year one, no PATs boost,\n4:26\nincremental R&D investment, increasing\n4:28\nlong-term growth. Um, the buyback\n4:31\neffects uh the 90 $90 million buyback\n4:34\nrepurchase roughly 485 million shares at\n4:38\n$185. The share count declines by about\n4:40\n3.1%. EPS increases from 6\n4:44\n$17 to approximately $6.37.\n4:47\nThis modest EPS uplift um it occurs\n4:50\npurely from accounting mechanics, not\n4:52\nfrom operational improvement. The\n4:54\ndividend scenario is a $6 special\n4:57\ndividend transfers uh cash directly to\n5:00\nshareholders and this does not affect\n5:02\nthe share account or the EPS and the\n5:04\nretail shareholders prefer this because\n5:06\num they feel that it's immediate and a\n5:09\nliquid benefit. But Apple loses\n5:11\nstrategic flexibility.\n5:14\nThe debt payoff scenario is using a $90\n5:16\nbillion\n5:17\nusing $90 billion to reduce debt lowers\n5:20\nthat lowers the um leverage\n5:22\nsubstantially. Uh the bond holders\n5:24\nbenefits immediately from that. Um the\n5:26\nequity holders gain indirectly from\n5:28\nreduced risk and interest expense. Um\n5:30\nbut however, the opportunity cost is\n5:33\nhigh because Apple's depth is\n5:34\ninexpensive.\n5:36\nThe acquisition scenario is $90 billion\n5:38\nAR/VR strategic acquisition with\n5:41\nsynergydriven no patent improvement of\n5:43\n$2 billion delivers a 2.2% return in\n5:47\nyear one and that is well below Apple's\n5:50\nhistorical\n5:52\nROIC which creates risks. Um the upside\n5:56\ndepends entirely on long-term\n5:57\nintegration success and market\n5:59\nleadership.\n6:06\nThe R&D scenario. Incremental R&D adds\n6:08\nroughly 1% to long-term revenue growth\n6:11\nwhile returns materialize gradually.\n6:14\nThis scenario aligns best with Apple's\n6:16\ninnovation\n6:17\nuh driven identity. The comparison when\n6:20\nvalid when validating scenarios I\n6:23\ncompare EPS leverage and stakeholder\n6:24\noutcomes. So the buyback improve EPS the\n6:27\nmost. The debt reduction strengthens\n6:29\ncredit metrics the most. R&D improves\n6:31\nlong-term economics. The dividends score\n6:33\nhighest for retail investors and the\n6:35\nacquisitions concentrate risk with\n6:36\nuncertain payoff.\n6:39\nSo the the we're going to\n6:43\ncontrast the value creation and the\n6:45\nvalue transfer. So the buybacks mostly\n6:47\ntransfer value. The EPS rises because\n6:49\nshares shrink not because earnings\n6:51\nimprove. The executive benefit due to\n6:53\nstockbased compensation. Retail\n6:56\nshareholders gain only if the stock\n6:57\nrerates to maintain the P& Employees\n7:00\nwith options gain from higher prices and\n7:02\ntrue economic value is limited unless\n7:03\nthe shares are undervalued. And so the\n7:06\nlast slide is about strategic\n7:08\ntrade-offs. After reviewing the\n7:09\nscenarios, I evolved analysis by\n7:11\nincorporating strategic factors. These\n7:13\nare the factors that I incorporated and\n7:15\nthey are Apple's liquidity which gives\n7:18\nit flexibility, the buyback support,\n7:20\nprice stability during market\n7:23\nvolatility, R&D fuels long-term\n7:25\necosystem value, the debt payown\n7:27\nenhances ratings but reduces optional\n7:30\noptionality and the acquisitions pose\n7:33integrate integration risk."
