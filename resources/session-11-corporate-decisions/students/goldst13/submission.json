  "transcript": "0:02\nHello everyone. Uh my name is Abby\n0:03\nGoldstein and this is session 11\n0:05\nassignment for management 310. Um and\n0:08\ntoday I'm going to be acting as an\n0:10\nindependent analysis to evaluate Apple's\n0:12\nproposed 90 billion share repurchase\n0:14\nprogram to ensure a rigorous and\n0:17\ndiscipline recommendation. I have\n0:19\napplied the driver framework to analyze\n0:21\nthe financial and strategic implications\n0:23\nof this massive capital allocation\n0:26\ndecision. Um, so we're going to start\n0:28\nwith define and discover. Um, we're\n0:30\nlooking at a company with immense\n0:32\nliquidity about 165 billion in cash and\n0:35\n100 billion in annual free cash flow.\n0:38\nUm, the proposal on the table is to\n0:40\nspend 90 billion roughly 10% of the\n0:43\nmarket cap on a share of buyback. Um,\n0:46\nthe core problem that we need to solve\n0:47\nis does this buyback create genuine\n0:50\nlong-term value um or is it merely\n0:52\ntransferring wealth um from the company\n0:54\nto existing shareholders? I mean, we're\n0:56\ngoing to need to balance immediate\n0:58\nfinancial returns against long-term\n1:00\nstrategic needs. And this screenshot\n1:02\nright here is some of my code inputs for\n1:05\nthe parameters.\n1:07\nAnd now we're going to move to represent\n1:09\nwhere I've modeled four distinct paths\n1:12\nfor this capital. First, the buyback,\n1:15\nreducing the share count to engineer a\n1:17\nhigher earnings per share. Um second, um\n1:20\na special dividend, a onetime $6 cash\n1:23\npayout to shareholders. Um the black\n1:25\ntext is outlining outlining my code\n1:28\ninput. Third, debt reduction, paying\n1:31\ndown 90 billion of debt to fortify the\n1:33\nbalance sheet. Um the black text is also\n1:35\noutline outlining my code input as well.\n1:38\nUm and then lastly, R&D or acquisitions,\n1:42\ninvesting in high growth areas like AI\n1:44\nor VR. Um and my model in the next slide\n1:47\num compares these scenarios side by\n1:49\nside, but I'm going to go to my code\n1:53\ninstead.\n1:56\nright here. So in the implement stage I\n1:59\nran a quantitative model um this chart\n2:03\nwhich was given to me in my code output\n2:05\nand this shows the immediate impact on\n2:08\nearnings per share. As you can see the\n2:11\nbaseline EPS or earnings per share is\n2:14\n$6.17.\n2:16\nUm the dividend and R&D options are\n2:18\nneutral in year 1. They don't change the\n2:21\nearnings per share immediately. Um\n2:24\nhowever you can look at the buyback and\n2:26\ndebt reduction. Um both are creative\n2:28\nmeaning they boost the earnings per\n2:30\nshare. Interestingly um debt reduction\n2:33\nbeats the buyback slightly raising\n2:35\nearning earnings per share to $6.37%.\n2:40\nUm compared to the buyback um and this\n2:43\nproves that we can boost earnings um\n2:45\nwithout buying back shares um but simply\n2:48\nby saving interest expense. Um, so I'm\n2:51\ngoing to go back to my\n2:55\nslide.\n2:57\nAnd now\n2:59\nin the validate section, um,\n3:03\num, we checked the risks risks because\n3:06\nwe found out that the earnings per share\n3:08\nis only half of the story. Um, and we\n3:11\ncheck the risks by using the depth to\n3:13\nequity ratio. Um, and this screenshot is\n3:16\njust the same one that we were just\n3:17\ndiscussing. Um, but we're talking about\n3:20\nthe depth to equity ratios now. So, as\n3:23\nyou can see, if we pursue the buyback,\n3:25\nwe deplete cash. Um, and our leverage\n3:27\nstays higher at 0.04.\n3:30\nUm, and we're structurally weaker.\n3:32\nHowever, um, if we choose debt\n3:34\nreduction, our leverage drops\n3:36\nsignificantly to 0.01.\n3:39\nUm this validates that while both\n3:40\noptions boost earnings debt red debt\n3:43\nreduction achieves it with lower risk\n3:45\nwhereas um buyback achieves it with\n3:48\nhigher risk.\n3:50\nSo in the evolve stage um we look beyond\n3:54\nthe spreadsheet um at stakeholders\n3:56\nagency conflict and market signal of\n3:59\naction. Um so we're going to start with\n4:01\nthe buyback. Um it creates um severe\n4:04\nagency conflict. Um the mechanical\n4:07\nearnings per share um boost helps\n4:10\nmanagement um hit their bonus target and\n4:12\npushes their $170 strike options deep in\n4:17\nthe money. This is a classic value or\n4:20\nclassic um case of value transfer. Um we\n4:24\nalso see this transfer effect ownership\n4:26\nconcentration for institutional um\n4:29\nholders um up from six to 6.2%. Um,\n4:34\ncrucially, the buyback also mechanically\n4:37\nboosts our ROIC\n4:39\num by reducing the denominator um not by\n4:42\nimproving business operations. Um, this\n4:45\nis often um used to mask a lack of\n4:49\noperational improvement. Um, the clear\n4:52\nlosers are the bond holders um who see\n4:55\nus spending cash while leaving the debt\n4:57\nload high.\n4:58\nUm, finally, we must consider the market\n5:01\nsignal. Um, a $90 billion buyback\n5:05\nsignals that the stock is undervalued.\n5:07\nUm, but more crucially, it signals that\n5:09\n90 billion cannot be better developed\n5:11\ninside the company for growth. Um, and\n5:14\nthis is a critique um of our long-term\n5:17\ncapital allocation discipline.\n5:20\nFinally, we can conclude that the 90\n5:23\nbillion buyback is an unnecessary value\n5:25\ntransfer that fails to test um that\n5:29\nfails the test of long-term capital\n5:31\nallocation discipline. Instead, I'm\n5:34\nrecommending a hybrid strategy that\n5:36\nbalances stakeholder needs and prioriti\n5:38\nprioritizes genuine value creation for\n5:40\nthe firm. Um so first allocate 40\n5:44\nbillion to R&D acquisition to secure our\n5:47\nfuture growth path in AI or VR. Um this\n5:50\nis the only path that offers true value\n5:52\ncreation and sends a vital signal of\n5:54\nlong-term ambition to the market.\n5:57\nSecond, allocate 30 billion to debt\n6:00\nreduction to lower financial risk,\n6:03\nappease bond holders and preserve\n6:05\ncapital structure optionality.\n6:08\nAnd then um and this signals um\n6:10\nfinancial discipline. Third um limit the\n6:14\nbuyback to 20 billion. Um this is enough\n6:17\nto signal confidence to the market and\n6:19\nprovide a modest capital return without\n6:21\nhollowing out our balance sheet. Um this\n6:25\napproach balances all stakeholder needs,\n6:27\nconnects our quantitative metrics to\n6:29\nstrategic goals and fulfills our fid\n6:32\nfiduciary um duty to maximize the long t\n6:36\nthe long-term intrinsic value of the\n6:38\nfirm. And this was my assignment. Um so\n6:42thank you for watching."
