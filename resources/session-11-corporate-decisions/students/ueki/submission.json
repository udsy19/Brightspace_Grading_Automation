  "transcript": "Hi. Okay. So, first we're going to begin by defining the inputs given within the problem. And so that's the first step of the code here. So the is share price $185.5 billion shares outstanding 30 which is the PE ratio. We immediately discover the 10% market capitalization buyback size is significant. Crucially we calculate the implied base net income of 95.6 6 billion um and the base EPS of $6.17. The high 30x PE ratio is our key signal which means the buyback is relatively expensive raising concerns about value transfer. Next we move on to our assumption section here. This stage is where we plan the person that we're about to go into next. Measure the five capital allocation scenarios against metrics like change APS and leverage as you seen the output below. We also state our assumptions for the alternatives of 15% ROC for the strategic acquisition and 5% after tax interest savings on debt reduction. This allows us to quantify the value creation potential of alternatives versus the buyback. Next we move on to our implementation. First with the 3.1 which is the share buyback. The $90 billion used reduces shares to 15 billion. And then the logic is that dividing the unchanged 95.6 billion dollars in net income by the lower share count results in a 3.24% EPS increase. This is purely just math and is a mechanism of value transfer and it doesn't grow the business. Second with special dividend the $90 billion cash is used but shares outstanding income remain unchanged resulting in 0.0 so 0% EPS change. Third is debt reduction in this section here. This code calculates interest savings and adds this to net income boosting it to $1.1 billion. So logic is that this yields a 4.71% EPS boost which is $6.46. Crucially, your debt drops to 20 billion and leverage falls dramatically from 0.038 to 0.007 as you'll see in the output below after I explain all the other steps as well. And we see that that is a powerful form of value creation to lower financial risk. So last talk about uh strategic acquisition. So this part of the code, it calculates incremental earnings from 15% ROIC boosting net income to $ 109.1 billion. This results in the highest EPS increase of 14.12% or 7.04. This is this represents the maximum value creation and signals long-term growth. So after I just explain all that, I'll just show you the code that outputed based off of that code. So next, right? Next thing we have to do is validate the outputs and reflect on the implications for the recommendation and by focusing on the stakeholder backs and governance as well. So in terms of value creation versus value transfer the 3.24% uh EPS boost as you can see here from the buyback is dwarfed by the strategic acquisition of 14.12%. Here the buyback is largely a value transfer which is selling shareholders getting a premium and remaining shareholders getting a higher EPS. But the acquisition and debt reduction options are true value creators yielding guaranteed debt reduction or high potential acquisition returns. In terms of agency considerations and stakeholder impact, the buyback is sub susceptible to agency costs because the 3.24% 24% EPS increase directly benefits managers with stock options tied to short-term performance. Bond holders strongly prefer debt reduction as leverage ratio plummets from 0.038 to 0.007\nand then the retail and instit institutional investors seeking long-term growth benefit most from the strategic acquisition based off of that 14.12%. Now in terms of the recommendation, this model shows the optimal choice is a hybrid of value create creating options. Therefore, my recommendation is to reject the full buyback and split the cash uh with $40 billion for debt reduction and $50 billion for strategic R&D/acquisition. This plan is superior because it maximizes long-term intrinsic value, reduces financial risk by lowering leverage, and mitigates the agency risk inherent in the short-term buyback. Thank you."
