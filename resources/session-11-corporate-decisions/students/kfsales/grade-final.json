  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly covers the primary groups—shareholders (including Berkshire), management (CEO), and bondholders/lenders—and explicitly notes employees with stock/options, discussing how each is affected across scenarios. This meets and exceeds the introductory completeness requirement with clear, stakeholder-specific implications, supported by Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the problem, identified stakeholders, and stated hypotheses before presenting the model and running scenarios, and they described using the DRIVER process up front. This satisfies the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly described a plan (inputs, five scenarios, and metrics) before analysis and then implemented it, reporting concrete artifacts (shares removed, EPS increase) and a validation check. This clear mapping from representation to implemented and validated outputs meets the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that debt increases financial risk and that paying down debt lowers risk and interest costs, but never identifies the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the moderate strictness, this shows basic but incomplete understanding of the capital structure trade-off, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies winners and preferences across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, and a large holder, and notes value shifting, satisfying the stakeholder-conflict portion. However, they do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks (e.g., how reduced cash/increased leverage transfers value from bondholders to equity), leaving a key element missing. Hence, the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that paying down debt lowers risk and reduces interest costs, and discusses how buybacks raise EPS, showing some understanding of financing choices’ impact on return. However, they do not explicitly explain how leverage amplifies both gains and losses nor clearly connect debt’s fixed interest to increased default risk. Coverage is correct but basic, so this merits a PARTIAL.",
