  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student covers primary stakeholders—shareholders (retail), management (CEO incentives), and lenders (financial risk/credit rating)—and briefly notes employees (options). Scenario discussion links actions (buyback vs debt reduction) to stakeholder impacts, meeting completeness at an introductory level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Define stage and records detailed discovery data (liquidity, market context, stakeholders) at the start of the transcript, then proceeds to model scenarios (scenario A EPS calculation). That ordering and documentation satisfy the requirement that Define & Discover were completed before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified both the interest tax shield of debt and the increased financial risk/leverage, showing conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief and lacks depth or multiple applications, so it meets the criterion at a basic level rather than a thorough one.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student shows a basic grasp of agency issues by noting CEO EPS incentives, large-holder effects, and leverage/financial risk. However, they do not systematically identify who gains/loses across shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, and large holders, and they do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to buybacks/leverage. Hence, correct but incomplete coverage warrants PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that repurchases raise EPS (return side) and that lower cash/debt reduction affects financial risk. However, they do not explicitly connect leverage to amplified downside (EPS/ROE volatility) or discuss fixed interest obligations/default risk. The treatment is conceptually correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.",
