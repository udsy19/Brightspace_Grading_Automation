  "transcript": "0:01\nOkay, this is my session 11 assignment.\n0:04\nSo\n0:06\nfor the define stage,\n0:09\nuh what I wanted to look at is just\n0:11\nwhat's the goal here. So evaluate\n0:13\nApple's hypothetical $90 billion share\n0:15\nrepurchase using Driver. Act as an\n0:18\nindependent analyst who must determine\n0:20\nwhether the buyback creates value\n0:21\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\n0:24\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\n0:27\nSome of the things to look at uh for\n0:29\nliquidity they have 165 billion in cash\n0:32\ninvestments then 100 billion of annual\n0:35\nfree cash flow. So market context is\n0:38\ntheir share price is $185.\n0:41\nThe price to earning ratio is 30. The\n0:44\ndividend yield is.5%\n0:46\nand they have 15.5 billion shares\n0:48\noutstanding.\n0:51\nFor their balance sheets, they have $\n0:52\n110 billion of debt, of which\n0:54\nBirkshshire Hathway owns 6%.\n0:58\nCEO holds three million shares himself.\n1:01\nUh retail investors average about 100\n1:04\nshares. Employees have $170 strike\n1:07\noptions.\n1:09\nAnd then the proposal will be a $90\n1:10\nbillion buybacks executed over one year,\n1:13\nwhich would be about 10% of the market\n1:16\ncap. And then some alternatives with the\n1:20\nmoney would be a $6 special dividends, a\n1:24\nstrategic AI/VR\n1:26\nacquisition,\n1:28\na debt reduction or incremental research\n1:32\nand development.\n1:34\nThen to deliver recommendation that\n1:36\nexplains stakeholder impacts, agency\n1:39\nconsiderations and value creation versus\n1:42\nvalue transfer incomes. So in looking at\n1:45\nthe uh represent stage\n1:50\nuh I had to go through multiple uh\n1:55\ndifferent prompts. So I'm not going to\n1:56\nread through all of them, but\n1:58\nessentially what they were was taking in\n2:01\nthe uh situation,\n2:04\nanalyze the uh future impacts and uh\n2:11\ngive\n2:13\nin-depth insights about what they would\n2:15\ndo in the positives and negatives. So\n2:17\nthat's kind of what I was thinking for\n2:19\nthe represent stage was just look at\n2:21\nwhat advantages and disadvantages do\n2:23\neach of the decisions have. And then for\n2:25\nthe influence stage, we can look at what\n2:28\nI have here. So, as you can see for uh\n2:32\nscenario A, you have a $90 million uh\n2:36\nshare repurchase. Uh it's calculated the\n2:40\nnew earnings per share would go up to\n2:41\n6.37. And this ends up happening because\n2:44\nthere are overall less shares on the\n2:46\nmarket and you have the same earnings.\n2:48\nAnd then obviously if you did a buyback\n2:52\nof shares typically it'll cause your\n2:54\nstock price to go up but obviously it\n2:56\ncan't calculate what the stock price\n2:58\nwould go up by cuz I mean you really\n3:00\nwouldn't know until the uh till you\n3:03\nactually did it. But that is another\n3:05\npositive that would come then as you can\n3:08\nsee summary some positives is as I\n3:11\nmentioned earlier you can technically\n3:13\nboost the earnings per share because\n3:15\nthere's less shares on the market but\n3:16\nyou have the same earnings. So obviously\n3:18\nthe earnings per share goes up. Um it\n3:21\nwould increase the ownership percentage\n3:24\nfor someone like Birkshshire Hathaway\n3:26\nwho was at\n3:29\n6% before. If you take $90 billion worth\n3:33\nof shares off of the market, that 6%\n3:35\nwould drop up by uh quite a bit.\n3:40\nUh and then yeah, a tax efficient return\n3:43\nof capital compared to giving out a\n3:46\ndividend to people because you wouldn't\n3:48\nhave to pay taxes on it. Some potential\n3:51\nnegatives is uh\n3:54\nthey're saying value destruction if the\n3:56\nprice earnings of 30 would make the\n3:58\nstock overvalue. That is potentially\n4:01\ntrue. uh it increases leverage by\n4:04\nreducing the cash buffer because now you\n4:06\ndon't have nearly as much cash on hand\n4:10\nand then uh creates some agency risk\n4:14\nbecause the CEO\n4:17\nall of a sudden has a lot more uh\n4:21\nshort-term EPS focus\n4:25\nwhich could cause him to make some\n4:27\npotentially more rash decisions.\n4:30\nUh when looking at scenario B, the $90\n4:34\nbillion debt reduction\n4:37\nuh\n4:39\nshowing the EPS that would make a\n4:41\ndifference. It shows that your remaining\n4:43\ndebt would end up being about $20\n4:45\nbillion.\n4:46\nObviously, the\n4:49\npositives of this is it reduces\n4:53\nfinancial risk because you no longer\n4:55\nhave to worry about paying off that debt\n4:57\nsometime in the future. it could lead to\n5:00\nincreased credit rating as well. So\n5:04\noverall, that's positive\n5:06\nand then you don't have to deal with the\n5:08\npotential agency risks that you had in\n5:09\nscenario A. Uh potential negatives is\n5:15\nthe EPS change isn't nearly as much. It\n5:19\nreduces the tax shield because you're no\n5:22\nlonger uh when you borrow, you have a\n5:26\ntax shield and get rid of that when you\n5:28\npay off the borrowing and then it\n5:30\nforgoes an immediate mechanical lift on\n5:33\na buy of a buyback. And so you no longer\n5:36\nget those uh boosts to your stock.\n5:40\nAnd scenario C is just a bit of an\n5:42\namalgamation of the alternatives at the\n5:45\nbottom here.\n5:47\nUh the first one being the $6 special\n5:51\ndividend.\n5:53\nThe overall positive is you just\n5:55\ninstantly get cash in the shareholders\n5:58\nhands, which for a company like Apple\n6:01\nthat has a ton of shareholders could be\n6:05\na really good thing and it could\n6:06\nconvince a lot of people to invest in\n6:08\nApple. However, I I doubt they would\n6:10\never do something like that ever again.\n6:12\nUh the negative is it's taxable and the\n6:17\nfuture growth and the odds that you\n6:20\nincrease investment by much with that is\n6:21\npretty low.\n6:24\nThe AI/verirtual reality acquisition\n6:28\nuh the positive is those are both really\n6:33\nuh high potential markets. So there is a\n6:37\npretty good opportunity for a high price\n6:40\ntoearnings ratio. The negative is it's\n6:44\nprobably pretty risky because\n6:48\nI mean it's it's a very high growth\n6:51\npotential, but also there's a high\n6:53\npotential you end up getting killed in\n6:55\nsomething like that. Not actually like\n6:57\nyou end up losing a ton of money and so\n7:00\nit's a decent idea, but overall it could\n7:03\ncause some problems with you not getting\n7:05\nyour money back on it.\n7:08\nThen incremental research and\n7:09\ndevelopment, it just continues to\n7:11\nsustain their competitive advantage.\n7:14\nUh the negative of it is over the long\n7:17\nrun, the financial returns compared to\n7:20\nsome of the other options just isn't\n7:23\nanywhere near as high as it probably\n7:25\nwould have been. But overall, the thing\n7:28\nwith incremental research and\n7:29\ndevelopment is a company like Apple does\n7:31\nthat regardless. So I'm not sure them\n7:33\nspending another 90 billion doing it\n7:34\nwould get them any further than they\n7:36\nalready are. So overall, that's probably\n7:38\nnot a great idea. I think overall what\n7:41\nmy recommendation would be is probably\n7:44\nto just do the share repurchase, but\n7:47\nthat's just cuz looking at the other\n7:48\nscenarios, the debt reduction doesn't\n7:51\nreally help them all that much. And then\n7:53\nthe special dividend is just not a good\n7:54\nidea to begin with. The AI/VR\n7:57\nacquisition seems pretty risky and\n8:00\nthere's a decent chance it ends up not\n8:02\nworking. But that's something they could\n8:03\nlook into depending on the numbers. cuz\n8:05\nobviously we don't have all the numbers\n8:06\nfor it to figure out whether or not it's\n8:08\na good idea. And then the incremental\n8:10\nresearch and development probably\n8:11\ndoesn't need $90 billion worth of cash.\n8:15\nSo yeah, overall I'd probably just\n8:17\nrecommend scenario A.\n8:20\nAnd then looking at the validate stage,\n8:23\nuh there's not really a ton of\n8:26\nvalidation to do. I looked over these to\n8:30\nmake sure that it all kind of made sense\n8:32\nand it did. So that's kind of really all\n8:35\nI did for the validation stage. For the\n8:38\nevolve stage, if I have I went through\n8:41\nabout three of these before I found the\n8:43\none that actually has all the\n8:44\ninformation uh typed out as I need it.\n8:48\nBefore it wasn't really giving me the\n8:51\nfull summary of what happens\n8:54\nnecessarily. It would just give me the\n8:56\nvalues, which is good, but it doesn't go\n8:58\nquite as in-depth as I was looking for.\n9:01\nAnd so, yeah, and then for the reflect\n9:04\nstage, something I would potentially do\n9:06\nis expand scenario C and make this\n9:09\nscenario C, this scenario D, this\n9:12\nscenario E, and potentially try to look\n9:13\ninto it more. But we kind of don't have\n9:16\nthe information to do that. But if I did\n9:18\nhave more information, that's probably\n9:19\nthe next step that I would take. Um, and\n9:22\nyeah, that's it. Thank you."
