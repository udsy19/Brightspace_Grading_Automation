  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student addresses shareholders (retail/institutional), management, bondholders, and employees, and discusses impacts across alternatives and signaling, meeting completeness at an introductory level. Given the moderate standard, the breadth and repeated stakeholder treatment across DRIVER stages is sufficient for a thorough PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides clear procedural steps/formulas for the analysis (EPS formula, ownership concentration) and reports concrete numeric outputs and sanity checks (input values, 90/185 = 486.5M shares, EPS change to 6.37), demonstrating executed and validated calculations at an introductory level. This is thorough enough under the moderate standard to satisfy the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the Discover objectives and scope before describing Represent and the modeling steps, meeting the strict requirement that Define/Discover be completed and documented prior to modeling. Evidence shows a clear, sequential DRIVER workflow rather than a post-hoc D-stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes that leverage increases risk/de-risking (meets the risk side), but never identifies the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the criterion explicitly requires both the tax benefit and increased risk, and only the risk aspect is addressed (across Implement/Reflect), the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies winners/losers across options (equity holders, bondholders, employees, large holders) and notes divergent preferences (e.g., bondholders prefer de-risking; large holders favor buybacks). However, they do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage/buybacks and provide limited depth on why incentives diverge. Hence, correct but incomplete coverage warrants a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not explain that leverage amplifies both returns and risks, nor that debt adds fixed interest obligations and increases default risk. While leverage is mentioned and debt reduction is labeled “de-risking,” there is no substantive treatment linking financing choice to risk/return dynamics, and one statement about leverage/net cash is confused.",
