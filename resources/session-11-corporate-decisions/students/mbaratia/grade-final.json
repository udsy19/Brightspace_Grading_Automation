  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly describes the visualization results, naming each scenario and reporting specific EPS values, and explains units (EPS in dollars; net income in billions). They explicitly reference the chart and articulate trade-offs across capital allocation options, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a Define & Discover stage with baseline data and assumptions prior to moving into Represent and Implement/modeling. Given the clear, ordered statements and supporting details, the criterion is fully met.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly described the planned metrics and data needs in the Represent stage (e.g., EPS, net income, market cap) and then implemented that plan via scenario functions and outputs (data frame, bar chart) in Implement/Evolve/Validate. This shows systematic linkage from representation to implemented artifacts, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes the tax effect of interest via an after-tax calculation, implying understanding of the interest tax shield. However, they do not identify that debt increases financial risk or distress costs. Given the moderate strictness, this shows partial conceptual grasp but lacks the balanced trade-off discussion required for a full pass.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify gains/losses for shareholders, bondholders, management, employees, or large holders under each option, nor explain why their incentives diverge. It also omits asset substitution and risk-shifting dynamics from buybacks/leverage. While stakeholders are mentioned and scenario analysis is performed, the agency-conflict analysis required by the criterion is missing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discussed return effects of financing (EPS/net income changes) but did not explain leverage as amplifying both returns and risks, nor note debt’s fixed interest increasing default risk. Given the moderate standard, the absence of any risk discussion results in failure on this leverage criterion.",
