  "transcript": "Hi, this is Timmy and this is my session\n11 homework.\nSo for this part, we will define a\nproblem and discover the financial\nscenario we need. So here is our\nassignment overview. So we will evaluate\nit Apple's hostical $19 billion share\nrepurchase using driver as an\nindependent analyst who must determine\nwhether badback create value relief to\nalternative uses of cash while balancing\nstakeholder incentives.\nSo, Apple consider spending about $19\nbillion of its cash on share by bag,\nspecial dividend, debit reduction, AI\nacquisition\nand investment. So, our goal is find we\ntry to create the most long-term value\nwithout harming his stake uh holders\nlike real investors, CEOs, employees,\noptions, bond holders like their\ninterest. So, let's get started. Here is\nall the like the allocation model.\nWe put all the given numbers into this\nmodel and here is it will create a\nbaseline for that like and for the EPS,\nnet income, market cap and the leverage\nvalue.\nSo we'll now turn these business ideas\ninto functions. Each function model one\nscenario like Bayback, special dividend\nand error function returns EPS, share\nprice, market cap, leverage and here is\nour Bayback model. The net income equals\nbaseline income minus amount uh plus\nrisk-free interest risk on cash.\nWe have a special dividend debit\nreduction. This is all the model we need\nand I need and and\nlet me run.\nSo now we have drawn all these scenar\nmodels and we will assemble them in the\ntable.\nFor this table we shows that how each\nlike choice a fights like Apple's EPS\npress and leverage like buyback slightly\nboosts EPS by reducing share count. The\nspecial dividend lowers EPS because\nApple loses interest income and depth\nreduction raises EPS and makes Apple\nsafer. The AI driver question gives the\nbiggest EPS lift because it's a new\nprofit and R&D hurts short-term EPS and\nincreases leverage because spending\nis expand immediately.\nSo we will check\ndo these results make sense. So for\nexamples EP for Bback\nwe refers to fewer shares and the EPS\nshould increase for the debt reduction\nlowering interest expense tends to have\nlike EPS rises slightly and for the\nacquisition like if all I is about 12%\nthe cash is about interest is about 3%\nthe EPS should increase and for R&D we\nhave more spending and the EPS should\ndrop in year\nSo here is what we have. The buyback\nversus baseline is about 108 versus 10\n16 and depth reduction area versus\nbaseline it's about\n0.068\nversus 0.03.\nSo now we will create with a charts to\nto show that to make the comp\ncomparative more\nuh more straightforward. So the EPS\nchart highlights that\nacquisition gives the strongest earning\nimprovements followed by the depth\nreduction. And while buybacks help only\na little special dividend slide reduce\nEPS and R&D produces the lowest EPS\nbecause its cost h immediately and this\nshows which options improve earning\nversus which weaken them in the short\nrun.\nAnd for the leverage for the depth\ncomparison the leverage chart shows the\ndepth reduction dramatically improves\nApple's financial safely by leveraging\nby lowering leverage buyback dividend\nand acquisition remain close to baseline\nwhere R&D increases leverage because\nequity value drops. So this helps\ncompare which option strengthen or\nweakens Apple's balance sheet.\nSo from this assignment what I learned\nis how finance decisions affect EPS\nleverage and stakeholders that buybacks\nmainly transfer value they don't create\nnew cash and for agency concerns the\nsales with stock come often like\nbuybacks\nwhy investers may prefer de reduction or\nor acquisition and also that the capital\nallocation discipline matters like the\n19 billion is a huge number. So\nwhat we have like for suggested like\nreflection is it does so the driver I\nlearned how to turn a financial problem\ninto structure model. I learned that the\nbadbacks increase EPS mostly by reducing\nshare share account not by improving the\nbusiness. So depth reduction improves\nstability occasion create value only if\nI exceed the lost interest on cash and\nR&D sacrifice shortterm EPS but helps\nlong-term innovation. So this tradeoffs\nhelp me understand value creation versus\nvalue transfer and how different\nstakeholders benefit differently. And\nthat's all for my uh session 11. Thank\nyou for watching."
