  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplied a baseline plus multiple sensitivity scenarios (50/90/120bn buybacks), discussed diminishing returns and liquidity/leverage risks, and gave an explicit ROIC breakpoint (~3.4%) that governs when strategic investments beat buybacks. Coverage is concrete, multi-example, and aligned with REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT/EVOLVE stages, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student both describes producing code-based outputs for multiple scenarios and documents manual re-computation that matched those outputs, showing execution and validation. Given the multiple scenario results and explicit validation steps, this meets the introductory-level requirement thoroughly.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the problem, stakeholders, objectives, and constraints up front and clearly declares completion of the Define/Discover stage before beginning representation/modeling. This meets the strict requirement for an explicit, pre-model D-stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies that higher leverage increases financial risk, but nowhere discusses the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Because the criterion requires recognizing both sides of the trade-off, the omission of tax benefits results in a fail despite the risk discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes key stakeholders, notes bondholder sensitivity to leverage, and frames buybacks as value transfer among shareholders, showing basic agency-awareness. However, they do not detail who gains/loses under each option nor explain asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks. Depth and specifics are insufficient for a PASS under this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links financing choices to returns (EPS lift) and acknowledges leverage-related risks and bondholder sensitivity, showing a basic conceptual grasp. However, they do not explain how leverage amplifies returns and losses nor mention debt’s fixed interest obligations and default risk, so coverage is not thorough enough for a PASS.",
