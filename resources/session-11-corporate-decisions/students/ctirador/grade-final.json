  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly ties the buyback decision to management incentives (EPS-linked bonuses and targets) and highlights conflicts among stakeholders, including management vs bondholders and differing shareholder preferences. The discussion is specific and applied, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound treatment consistent with the Reflect and Final Decision stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student covers all primary stakeholders—shareholders (split into institutional and retail), management, and bondholders—and also includes employees, providing concise rationales for each group’s preference. This satisfies and slightly exceeds the introductory completeness requirement, with adequate depth for a moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly documents the Discover stage (problem, objectives, capital/stakeholder context) at the start of the submission and then proceeds to Represent and Implement later, meeting the strict requirement that Define & Discover be completed and recorded before modeling.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies that debt affects financial risk (safer if debt is paid down) and references leverage/DFL, meeting the risk side. However, they never acknowledge the tax benefit of debt (interest tax shield); their tax discussion concerns dividends vs buybacks. Thus, correct but incomplete coverage warrants PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies who gains/loses across management, large holders, retail, bondholders, and employees and gives brief incentive-based reasons. However, the asset substitution and risk-shifting mechanics tied to leverage/buybacks are only lightly implied (via a small DFL change and a note that bondholders don’t benefit from risky investments) and not explained in depth. Thus, the treatment is correct but basic, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly referenced leverage metrics (ROE with leverage, DFL) and noted changes consistent with leverage affecting risk/return, but treatment was brief and somewhat inconsistent, with minimal explanation of how leverage amplifies outcomes. They did not explicitly connect debt to fixed interest obligations and default risk, only broadly noting safety, so coverage is basic rather than thorough.",
