  "transcript": "So, hi everyone. My name is Sean. Today, this is my homework 11. So, in this video, I'll evaluate Apple's proposed um 90 billion share repurchases against four alternatives using the drivers framework. I'll qualify earning per share, share account, and ownership, net cash leverage, and whether investments beat WACC. And then I'll give a balance recommendation that considers stakeholder incentives, not just the optics. Now starting with the define and discover section. So we're comparing five choices. A 90 billion buyback, a $6 special dividend, a 90 billion acquisition, a 90 billion debt reduction, and an incremental R&D at 20 billion. So the baselines from the model, first of all, the earning per share is around 6.17 and net income of 95.6 billion, a market cap um of 2.87 87 trillion and net cash of 55 billion. So the outputs I'll track to I'll track for each scenario is earning per share shares net cash and for investments the ROIC through to WCC spread now going to represent uh first of all all my code and Google collab are generated with charge PT. So starting with the blueprint. So buyback I spend uh spend 90 billion of cash. I include an optional uh 30 uh optional three plus 3% print uh price impact and subtract for gone after tax interest for dividends. for the dividend scenario um a $6 per share and shares unchanged cash leaves for the acquisition for 90 billion strategic acquisition uh deploy of 90 billion at RIC and compared to WCC 8.5% only spreads over WCC count for the 90 billion uh debt reduction uh pay down 90 billion and capture after tax interest savings and for incre incremental R&D and invest 20 billion at 13% expected return treated as a portfolio of options. So for incentives I track B uh Birkshshire at 6% CO 3 million shares and employee options with a 170 strike. Now going to implement. So for the results we we got um first of all for the first uh scenario the buyback it has an earning per share of 6.17 shares of 1503 billion about 0.47 47 billion retired after the 3% move an NI 92.7 billion due to the loss interest and a net cash of negative 35 billion and earning per share up mechanically liquidity down. Next going to the second scenario of dividend for divid dividend the earning per share is 5.98 with a shares of 15.5 billion and 92.6 6 billion and net net cash of negative 38 billion. Uh the pure transfer to holders and it has no durable earning per share is left. The third scenario is the depth deduction. And the result is we got an earning per share of 6.37 shares of 15.5 billion and 98.98 of.9 billion from interest savings a net cash of positive 55 billion and the highest earning per share and strongest balance uh and strong strongest balance sheet. This result has the highest earning per share and strongest balance sheet and for the acquisition scenario it has an earning per share of 6.25 25 net cash negative 35 billion with a spread of positive 150 bps over WACC and it beats uh this result beats buyback dividend on fundamentals but uses liquidity and adds execution risk and for the last scenario is the which is the R uh the R&D it has a 13% expected so the result is earning per share of 6.22 22 with a net cash of positive 35 billion a spread of positive 450 bps on 20 billion and it clears WCC while preserving flexibility and the stakeholder snapshot under buyback uh break rises from 6% to 6.119% on denominator shrink the CEO takes uh 0.01 9% to 0.02% 02% and employee option insrinsic value increases from $15 to 20.55 per option with the price bump um classic value transfer. Now showing um the visualizations we generated for this first uh for for this first graph the visually debt reduction leads on earning per share at 6.37 followed by acquisition of um 6.25 R&D 6.22 22 R&D 6.22 22 buyback um 6.17 dividend 5.9A and on net cash um on net cash which is this second graph here um the debt reduction jumps to positive 55 billion um and R&D maintains a 35 billion while buyback and acquisition dropped to negative 35 billion and dividend to - 38 billion. So that balance sheet picture is cr is critical for ratings and future optionality. Now going to validations. So the sanity checks line up. So buybacks lift earning per share by shrinking uh by shrinking shares but reduce net income through loss interest and dividends cut cash with no earning per share benefit. Depth reduction both raises earning per share and d- risks and acquisition and R&D only create value if return um return is larger than WACC which is the accounting logic and finance and finance logic are consistent talking about the involved involvements. So two quick robustness test. First of all, the buyback earning per share versus price impact at 0% impact earning per share $6.18. The 2% um to six uh 6.17 5% to 6.17 8% to 6.16 and the small price moves. This barely changes earning per share. The foregone interest caps the caps the benefit for the acquisition earning per share versus ROIC at 8% below um below WCC earning per share 6.14 with 9% 6.2 10% of 6.25 25 12% of 6.37 earning per share and this shows why boards demand a clear ROIC WACCC premium after before doing big deals for the agency and stakeholders and it's translating to incentives. The long-term holders gain concentrate from buybacks but give up some flexibility and the management option employees benefit from price link compensation which can be value transfer without operating improvement and bond holders and rating agencies prefer debt reduction higher coverage and lower risk and income oriented retail may like a special dividend but it's the least strategic choice here for reflect and recommend putting all putting it all together for earning per share in resilience the debt reduction is the winner with a 6.37 earning per share and and positive 55 billion net cash so the buybacks provide optical earning per share lift and concentrate ownership but push Apple to negative 35 billion net cash and which is a real hit to flexibility now the acquisitions only make sense with a sustained spread over WACC and incredible integration plan at 10% ROIC the premium is modest for the RA for the R&D at 13% expected return looks strategically attractive it clears WCC compounds capability and keeps 35 billion of net cash so my recommendation is the sequent plan so first of all prioritize that reduction now to lock in low-risk earning per shares lift and strengthen the balance sheet. Next, fund the high IR R&D that clearly exceeds WACC by several hundred basis points. Third, use measured buybacks as residual after balance sheet targets and high spread investments are covered. And lastly, for for M&A, enforce a minimum RYC to WACCC hurdle and track post deal realization. So in conclusion, all assumptions in the model are par uh are parameterized WCC RIC buyback price impact and rates. So it's easy to rerun with new data. And the next steps will be to adding rating guard uh guard rails link RIC to segment drivers and include government governance scorecard for stakeholder impacts. So thanks for watching my video."
