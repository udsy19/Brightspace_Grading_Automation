  "transcript": "0:01\nHello, my name is Lucas Case and for\n0:03\nweek 11 we are going to look into a case\n0:08\nabout corporate decisions and\n0:10\nincentives.\n0:15\nFirst here we're going to have an\n0:16\noverview of our scenario. We're going to\n0:19\nbe evaluating a hypothetical $90 billion\n0:23\nshare repurchase by Apple. uh we are an\n0:27\nindependent analyst who's determining\n0:29\nwhether or not the buyback creates value\n0:31\nrelative to other alternative uses of\n0:34\ncash while also balancing stakeholder\n0:37\nincentives.\n0:39\nUm here is the info for Apple's capital\n0:44\nallocation in the scenario. Uh for\n0:47\nliquidity they have $165 billion in cash\n0:50\nand investments with an annual free cash\n0:53\nflow of hundred billion dollars. Uh the\n0:56\nmarket context is their stock is\n0:59\ncurrently trading at $185 per share with\n1:02\na price to earnings ratio of 30, a\n1:05\ndividend yield of half a percent and\n1:07\nthey have 15.5 billion shares\n1:09\noutstanding. Uh on the balance sheet\n1:12\nthey have $110 billion worth of debt. Uh\n1:16\nBerkshire owns 6%. Uh there's Apple CEO\n1:20\nholds 3 million shares and retail\n1:22\ninvestors average about a 100 shares\n1:24\neach. Furthermore, employees have $170\n1:28\nstrike options.\n1:31\nAnd then some of the alternatives we're\n1:33\ngoing to look into are a $6 special\n1:36\ndividend, a strategic AI VR acquisition,\n1:42\nand uh a debt reduction or\n1:45\nand then lastly, we have incremental\n1:48\nR&D, which for these purposes, I'm going\n1:51\nto combine with a strategic AI or VR\n1:54\nacquisitions just because both include\n1:57\nusing more cash now. And all in all,\n2:00\nwe're going to give a recommendation at\n2:02\nthe end of this and explain any\n2:04\nstakeholder impacts and agency\n2:06\nconsiderations as well as looking to\n2:08\nwhich options are value creators and\n2:10\nwhich ones are value transfers.\n2:15\nUh first uh on the screen we have our\n2:17\nbaseline scenario. Uh this was generated\n2:21\ngenerated via Python using Google\n2:24\nCollab. Um you'll see the baseline\n2:26\nmarket capitalization is\n2:29\nuh 2867 a2.\n2:33\nUh the baseline net debt is55.\n2:36\nAgain these numbers are in billions. Uh\n2:39\nbaseline net leverage is\n2:40\napproximately0.42\n2:43\nand baseline net income is 95.6\n2:47\napproximately and the real kicker\n2:49\nbaseline EPS is 6.17.\n2:56\nUh here I have a screenshot of the class\n3:00\ncapital allocation model that I\n3:02\ngenerated in Python via Google Collab.\n3:06\nUh this is a part of the represent and\n3:08\nimplement stage. I built a Python class\n3:11\nnamed uh the capital allocation model to\n3:14\nstructure my analysis. And on the screen\n3:17\nyou'll see it's the constructor\n3:20\nfunction. its job is to ingest the\n3:22\nspecific financial constraints that we\n3:25\ntalked about. Those are my scenarios\n3:27\nthat we're going to dive into.\n3:30\nUh that holds like the $165 billion of\n3:34\ncash balance and the share price, stuff\n3:36\nlike that. and it stores these inputs\n3:38\nand then it can from that generate\n3:42\nscenarios to determine what the new EPS\n3:45\nprice for example or the new EPS would\n3:48\nbe for example in the scenarios that\n3:50\nwe're going to discuss. I just wanted to\n3:52\nshare some of the background on how I\n3:55\ngot that to work via uh Google Collab\n3:58\nand Python.\n4:00\nSo now that we've talked about how I\n4:01\nmade it happen, here are the results. So\n4:05\nfor the special dividend scenario, the\n4:08\nnew EPS was 5.93 which is lower than the\n4:11\nbaseline. New net leverage is 0.29 which\n4:14\nis higher than the baseline. Uh CEO\n4:17\nownership percentage does not change in\n4:20\nthis scenario. However, employee option\n4:22\nvalue per share does drop to 9. Uh for\n4:27\nthe debt deleveraging scenario, uh the\n4:30\nnew EPS is 6.22 which is higher than\n4:32\nbaseline. Net leverage does not change.\n4:36\nCEO ownership percentage does not change\n4:38\nand nor does the employee option value\n4:40\nper share. It stays at 15. Uh for the\n4:43\nshare buyback scenario, EPS is again\n4:46\nhigher than baseline at 6.37. Net\n4:49\nleverage does increase to 0.27. And in\n4:52\nthis scenario, uh CEO ownership\n4:55\nownership percentage does increase\n4:57\nbecause again it's a share buyback\n4:59\nscenario. and employee option value per\n5:01\nshare does stay steady in this one.\n5:04\nUh lastly, for the strategic investment\n5:06\nscenario, which is where I combined the\n5:09\nAI VR investment with the R&D, uh EPS is\n5:13\nthe highest at 6.52. Net leverage is\n5:16\nalso 0.27.\n5:18\nCEO ownership percentage does not change\n5:21\nand the employee option value per share\n5:24\ndoes increase to 25.45.\n5:29\nHere you'll see I generated a little bar\n5:32\ngraph just to summarize our results.\n5:35\nUm this just is a way for you to have a\n5:40\nvisualization of what's going on in the\n5:42\nbar graph. We have the baseline which is\n5:46\nuh 0.0. Uh in the blue we have our EPS\n5:50\nwhether it is an accretion or a\n5:52\ndilution. And then in the red we have\n5:55\nour net leverage change.\n5:57\nUm so for also on the left here you'll\n6:00\nsee a little table summarizing.\n6:03\nSo baseline we had an ETS of 6.17 a net\n6:07\nleverage of negative0.42\n6:10\nCEO ownership of uh30% which was just\n6:14\nthat 3 million shares. Um and an\n6:16\nemployee option value per share of $15.\n6:20\nUh in the share buyback scenario EPS\n6:22\nincreases to 6.37 net leverage increases\n6:24\nto 0.27 27 and CEO ownership does\n6:27\nincrease while the employee option value\n6:30\nper share doesn't. In the special\n6:31\ndividend scenario, our EPS decreases to\n6:34\n5.93. Uh while net leverage increases to\n6:37\n0.29,\n6:39\nCEO ownership does not change and\n6:41\nemployee option value per share\n6:42\ndecreases. In the debt deleveraging\n6:44\nscenario, again, I'm just reiterating\n6:47\nthis\n6:49\njust in summary before we get into our\n6:51\nanalysis and recommendation.\n6:54\nEPS increases to 6.22. Net leverage\n6:57\nstays the same. CEO ownership stays the\n7:00\nsame. Employee option value per share\n7:01\nstays the same.\n7:04\nAnd then for the strategic investment\n7:05\nscenario, EPS increases to 6.52. Net\n7:09\nleverage increases to 0.27.\n7:12\nC ownership and employee option value\n7:13\nper share stay the same. Now for all\n7:15\nthese scenarios,\n7:17\num we're going to discuss whether it's a\n7:20\nvalue transfer or a value creation. Uh\n7:23\nthe share buyback scenario is a value\n7:25\ntransfer\n7:27\nuh just because ownership is\n7:30\ntransferring its cash to more shares.\n7:33\nThe special dividend scenario is another\n7:35\nvalue transfer. Uh the debt deleveraging\n7:38\nscenario is value creation.\n7:41\nAnd then obviously the strategic\n7:43\ninvestment is value creation. Uh the\n7:45\nrationale behind all these share\n7:48\nbuybacks is a value transfer to\n7:50\nremaining shareholders via reduced share\n7:52\ncount or direct distribution. Uh this\n7:54\nincreases financial risk due to cash\n7:56\ndeployment. The special dividend\n7:58\nscenario is also value transfer to\n8:00\nremaining shareholders uh via reduced\n8:03\nshare count or direct distribution which\n8:04\nagain increases financial risk due to\n8:06\ncash deployment. uh debt deleveraging is\n8:09\nvalue creation through reduced interest\n8:12\nexpense and improved balance sheet\n8:13\nnumbers which reduces financial risk.\n8:16\nThis is our most conservative scenario.\n8:18\nAnd then the strategic investment is\n8:20\nvalue creation through new earnings from\n8:22\nsuccessful investments and this is\n8:25\nincreased financial risk due to cash\n8:28\ndeployment. Uh in summary uh my primary\n8:32\nrecommendation as an independent\n8:35\nuh analyst is to utilize the strategic\n8:38\ninvestment scenario. The data confirms\n8:42\nthat this is the only scenario that has\n8:45\ngenuine value creation not like that the\n8:48\nleveraging scenario. Uh the financial\n8:50\nimpact of this scenario is by deploying\n8:55\ncapital into high return on investment\n8:57\nuh growth we achieve the highest\n8:59\npossible EPS of 6.52.\n9:01\nUh it also has the most wealth for our\n9:04\nall parties and our stakeholder impact\n9:06\nis that they get their maximum earnings\n9:08\ngrowth and employees also see their\n9:10\noption value skyrocket to 25.45.\n9:15\nAnd as for signaling, this scenario\n9:17\nsignals to the market that Apple is on\n9:19\nan aggressive growth phase and has found\n9:21\nopportunities where the ROI exceeds our\n9:24\ncost of capital. Uh the second best\n9:27\noption is the share buyback, which was\n9:30\nthe uh proposal we were asked to\n9:32\nanalyze. If there's no viable\n9:34\nacquisitions to do our strategic\n9:36\ninvestment into the 90 the $90 billion\n9:40\nshare buyback is the superior fallback\n9:42\nscenario. Uh it is also accretive uh in\n9:45\nthe EPS realm as it raises EPS from the\n9:49\nbaseline to 6.37.\n9:51\nIt also increases net leverage. Uh\n9:55\nhowever, it's not that big of a deal\n9:57\nbecause the net leverage of 0.27 is uh\n10:02\nvery conservative compared to industry\n10:04\npeers like Amazon potentially. Uh and\n10:08\nfor the value nature, this one is not\n10:10\nvalue creation, but rather value\n10:12\ntransfer because we're not building new\n10:14\ncapacity. Uh rather optimizing the\n10:16\ndenominator of the share count to\n10:18\nbenefit remaining shareholders.\n10:21\nAs for the options we're going to be\n10:23\nrejecting, uh those are the debt\n10:24\ndeleveraging and special dividend\n10:26\nscenario. Uh I strongly advise against\n10:29\nthese alternatives. Uh on one hand you\n10:32\nwould like to reject the debt\n10:34\ndeleveraging scenario because net\n10:37\nleverage is already negative meaning we\n10:38\nare cash positive. Uh therefore using\n10:41\nliquidity to pay down debt only raises\n10:43\nEPS to 6.22 and it's an inefficient use\n10:46\nof capital. Uh and this is solving a\n10:49\nsolveny problem we don't have because we\n10:51\nhave more cash than debt. As for this\n10:54\nspecial dividend scenario, as we saw\n10:56\nfrom the EPS, this is the only scenario\n10:59\nthat had a lower EPS than our baseline\n11:02\nand it's the worst performing option. Uh\n11:05\nfurthermore, it essentially offers zero\n11:08\nstructural improvement to the business.\n11:11\nUh now to talk about more the agency\n11:14\nconsiderations.\n11:15\nUh there's a huge confl conflict in\n11:18\nregards to the employee option value\n11:21\ncolumn. Uh this was the column that\n11:23\nstayed steady at 15\n11:26\nin the debt deleveraging and\n11:31\nuh buyback scenario and then it\n11:33\nincreased to 25.5 in the strategic\n11:36\ninvestment\n11:38\nscenario and it decreased to nine with\n11:40\nthe uh special dividend scenario. The\n11:43\nconflict here is that management has a\n11:45\nsignificant financial disincentive to\n11:47\npay a special dividend uh because\n11:49\ndividends drop the stock price. The\n11:51\ndividend scenario as mentioned crashes\n11:53\nthe employee option value to $9.\n11:56\nUh on the other hand, the buyback\n11:58\nprotects option value at 15 and\n12:00\nincreases CEO ownership concentration.\n12:03\nUh so overall, the board must be aware\n12:06\nthat management might lobby for the\n12:07\nbuyback over the dividend, not because\n12:10\nof the shareholder benefit, but just to\n12:12\nprotect their own compensation packages.\n12:15\nSo although we proved with the math that\n12:17\nthe buyback is superior to the dividend\n12:20\nscenario for all shareholders\n12:23\nuh it is important to note that uh the\n12:26\nmanagement has a personal incentive for\n12:29\nthat scenario as well.\n12:31\nAnd lasting lastly before we wrap things\n12:34\nup, uh market perceptions.\n12:37\nUh if uh Apple chooses the strategic\n12:40\ninvestment path, they're signaling\n12:43\nconfidence and innovation and future\n12:44\ncash flows. If Apple chooses the share\n12:48\nbuyback method, they're signaling that\n12:50\nthey're a mature and stable and\n12:53\nprofitable uh but lacking in explosive\n12:56\nand organic growth uh ideas. the special\n13:01\ndividend idea uh lacks it signals a lack\n13:05\nof imagination\n13:07\nand that they're not Apple is running\n13:09\nout of ideas what to do with their cash\n13:12\nand lastly the debt deleveraging as I\n13:14\nmentioned earlier it's by far the most\n13:16\nconservative option and it's also\n13:18\nunnecessary given\n13:21\nhow much debt Apple has in 110 billion\n13:26\nwhereas they have $165 billion in cash\n13:29\nultimately Uh, my recommendation is to\n13:33\nlook for a strategic investment.\n13:36\nThis is the greatest value creator and\n13:37\nit yields the highest possible EPS.\n13:39\nThank you so much for your time and I\n13:41\nhope you learned something from this\n13:43\nvideo."
