So starting off our define\n00:00:08.800 and discover. So our goal is we need to\n00:00:10.719 decide the best way to spend $90 billion\n00:00:13.679 of Apple's cash. The problem is do we\n00:00:17.279 buy back our own stock, pay a dividend,\n00:00:19.680 or buy another company? The data that I\n00:00:22.800 got from the assignment. So our cash\n00:00:24.960 available is $165 billion and this\n00:00:27.680 generates hundred billion a year but we\n00:00:30.240 will use roughly $90 billion for this\n00:00:32.238 decision. The share price is $185. The\n00:00:35.680 total shares is $15.5 billion. Our\n00:00:38.879 profits to earning ratio is 30 and our\n00:00:42.480 alternatives are buyback versus special\n00:00:45.040 dividend versus acquisition which is\n00:00:47.280 like growth. And then some hidden\n00:00:49.760 numbers that the um assignment didn't\n00:00:52.320 find. Um so we didn't get net income\n00:00:55.440 directly but we found it. So for EPS is\n00:00:59.600 price divided by price to earnings and\n00:01:02.559 that will be $185 by 30. So it will be\n00:01:06.960 100 it would be $6.17\n00:01:09.600 $6.17 per share and then our total\n00:01:12.640 income would be $6.17*\n00:01:15.680 15.5 billion which is approximately\n00:01:18.000 $95.6 billion. And then our\n00:01:21.280 stakeholders, so shareholders, um, they\n00:01:24.000 want stock price up, so capital gains.\n00:01:27.119 Employees, they want job security and\n00:01:29.600 R&D, so long-term growth. Bond holders,\n00:01:32.640 they want capital to keep cash to pay\n00:01:34.240 debts safely.\n00:01:36.240 Um, or like safety, sorry. And then\n00:01:38.960 management, they want higher EPS, often\n00:01:41.759 tied to bonuses.\n00:01:44.320 So um what we're going to do is we will\n00:01:47.920 um model five scenarios to see who\n00:01:49.759 brings who wins and who loses. So\n00:01:52.960 buyback this would be like financial\n00:01:54.399 engineering. So the EPS focus special\n00:01:57.040 dividend which is like cash payout or\n00:01:58.799 yield focus. Acquisition which is buying\n00:02:00.960 growth which is high risk high reward.\n00:02:03.840 Debt um debt payown which reduces risk\n00:02:06.719 or safety focus. R&D injection which is\n00:02:09.840 inventing the future or long-term value.\n00:02:12.959 But our mental model, so like just to\n00:02:14.959 visualize it all, so imagine apple is\n00:02:17.120 like a pizza. Um buyback is we cut the\n00:02:20.400 pizza into fewer slices and then the\n00:02:22.400 remaining slices or the shares, they get\n00:02:25.360 bigger. Um which would be a higher EPS.\n00:02:28.400 And then dividend we would just hand\n00:02:30.560 cash the people holding the slices. So\n00:02:33.040 the pizza size stays the same. Or an\n00:02:36.000 acquisition, we use the cash to buy more\n00:02:38.000 pizza ingredients, which would be like\n00:02:39.840 another company. um hoping the whole\n00:02:42.319 pizza gets bigger in the future.\n00:02:45.120 So, implementing this, I went into\n00:02:48.480 Gemini, I'll show you. And I said, my\n00:02:52.800 prompt was create a Python code that\n00:02:54.480 answers an assignment using the KISS\n00:02:56.000 principle in the driver method to make\n00:02:58.000 it super easy to understand and teach to\n00:03:00.000 someone with financial knowledge. So, it\n00:03:01.680 popped me out of code, which is right\n00:03:04.000 here, and I will run it. Um, check mark.\n00:03:07.680 So, we're all good.\n00:03:09.519 So starting off this was just like\n00:03:11.440 values all from the case um that you can\n00:03:15.120 just look at the assignment and get and\n00:03:16.640 then like for um our implied metrics\n00:03:19.920 here that was the um earnings um the\n00:03:24.000 sorry like the net income that we found\n00:03:26.879 ourself when I stated the define and\n00:03:29.680 discover part of this video and um that\n00:03:33.760 was right here that we calculated\n00:03:35.519 ourselves and then the assumptions are\n00:03:37.040 just more from the case and then um\n00:03:39.840 other assumptions that we made as well.\n00:03:42.480 But we are calculating the EPS leverage\n00:03:45.280 and return on investment capital right\n00:03:47.840 here. And we're going to be doing this\n00:03:49.760 for all the categories such as baseline\n00:03:53.120 buyback, dividend acquisition, debt\n00:03:55.120 payown, and R&D injection. Um but these\n00:03:59.040 are all going to be for each category.\n00:04:01.519 Um leverage also something to know.\n00:04:03.519 Financial leverage amplifies both\n00:04:05.599 returns and risk to equity holders. So,\n00:04:07.599 a higher leverage would indicate higher\n00:04:09.519 risk and higher potential returns. Um,\n00:04:13.599 and then continuing on, as you can see,\n00:04:15.920 we do it for all the categories, which I\n00:04:18.079 explained.\n00:04:19.600 Um, and then they're also going to come\n00:04:21.120 out with like a takeaway as well as like\n00:04:23.199 what that means, um, based off their\n00:04:27.520 numbers. And then, um, we're going to\n00:04:31.520 get into stakeholder comparison. and\n00:04:34.240 it's going to say who like wins or loses\n00:04:36.479 based off the analysis and the numbers.\n00:04:38.960 So I'm going to run it again. As you can\n00:04:41.280 see, it works. So just going off this,\n00:04:44.800 here's our little matrix that popped\n00:04:47.280 out. So some of the takeaways, I'll just\n00:04:49.040 read buyback. It boosts EPS and has a\n00:04:51.040 high agency benefit. For dividend, there\n00:04:54.240 is a high trans there's a sorry for\n00:04:57.520 dividend there's a value transfer to\n00:04:58.960 owners and it's a neutral EPS\n00:05:01.199 acquisition. They have growth play and\n00:05:02.880 exit. quiz uh sorry execution has um\n00:05:06.720 execution risk is high debt payown has\n00:05:09.600 lowers risk and their bond holders love\n00:05:12.400 this R&D injection they have high\n00:05:14.960 innovation and long-term payoff and our\n00:05:18.320 win losses analysis for buyback the\n00:05:21.199 winner would be the CEO which is the EPS\n00:05:23.600 bonus and the loser would be the bond\n00:05:25.600 holders because of the less cash and\n00:05:27.919 cushion dividend the winner is the\n00:05:30.080 retail yield investors and the loser is\n00:05:31.919 the growth investors\n00:05:33.280 debt pay. The winner is bond holders for\n00:05:35.440 the safety and the loser is aggressive\n00:05:37.840 investors. R&D and acquisition are um\n00:05:41.360 the winner is employees in future growth\n00:05:43.759 and the loser would be short-term\n00:05:45.280 traders.\n00:05:46.800 So that is our output. Um so just\n00:05:50.960 looking at everything so buyback result\n00:05:52.800 we set 90 billion. So the buyback will\n00:05:55.600 show the highest EPS which is likely\n00:05:58.000 greater than $6.40.\n00:06:00.560 So this validates that value transfer or\n00:06:03.919 slicing the pizza differently rather\n00:06:05.680 than value creation. And the shares\n00:06:08.319 bought approximately 48 um 48 billion\n00:06:13.199 billion which is the new account\n00:06:14.800 approximately um 15.02 billion and then\n00:06:19.440 the new EPS should be higher because we\n00:06:22.240 divide income by fewer shares for um\n00:06:26.240 also the debt payown will show the\n00:06:28.400 lowest leverage. Um for dividend result\n00:06:32.479 the EPS drops slightly because we lost\n00:06:35.039 the in interest income on that cash but\n00:06:38.080 shareholders get cash in hand for\n00:06:40.880 acquisition results if the new company\n00:06:43.360 is profitable so 10% return the net\n00:06:46.240 income jumps up and EPS goes up without\n00:06:49.520 reducing shares and then the acquisition\n00:06:52.080 should show the highest return on\n00:06:54.080 investment capital um if we assume that\n00:06:56.479 acquisition is good and then ending off\n00:06:59.680 So the evolve section, so the\n00:07:01.520 stakeholder analysis, who wins? So if\n00:07:04.880 the CEO or like the agency, so they\n00:07:07.599 prefer the buyback because it boosts EPS\n00:07:09.759 from $6.17 to roughly $645.\n00:07:14.800 So CEOs are often paid bonuses based on\n00:07:17.840 EPS growth. Um conflict here is CEOs\n00:07:21.520 incentives might not match the company's\n00:07:23.360 long-term health and the data. So the\n00:07:26.560 CEO owns 3 million shares and has\n00:07:28.479 options. So some motivation is if Apple\n00:07:31.680 does a buyback, the share price usually\n00:07:34.319 jumps immediately and the CEO's CEO's\n00:07:37.039 personal wealth increases instantly. If\n00:07:39.759 Apple does R&D, the payoff might take 5\n00:07:42.479 to 10 years and the CEO might be retired\n00:07:45.199 by then. But as a result, management is\n00:07:48.080 naturally biased toward buybacks because\n00:07:50.560 it boosts their bonuses or the EPS\n00:07:52.880 targets and stock value today. even if\n00:07:55.919 R&D is better for the next decade.\n00:07:58.720 For in regards to retail investors, um\n00:08:02.240 they might prefer dividend for\n00:08:03.599 guaranteed income or buyback if they\n00:08:05.599 want tax deferred gains. We aren't\n00:08:08.000 making the company better. We are just\n00:08:09.440 moving cash from corporate bank account\n00:08:11.039 to the shareholders pockets. It's like\n00:08:13.440 slicing the pizza into fewer pieces.\n00:08:16.080 Like I mentioned before, um employees so\n00:08:19.199 they prefer acquisition growth or\n00:08:21.360 keeping the cash or the safety. um\n00:08:24.720 buybacks don't help them directly and we\n00:08:27.680 are trying to build a bigger company. So\n00:08:29.520 this is just harder um but it creates\n00:08:32.399 real wealth.\n00:08:34.399 So signaling effect so what the decision\n00:08:37.039 tells the world or what are we\n00:08:38.399 whispering to like the market. So a\n00:08:40.719 buyback signal it could be like we are\n00:08:42.958 confident. So translation we believe our\n00:08:45.519 stock is undervalued and we are buying\n00:08:47.440 it because it's a bargain. But like the\n00:08:49.760 side um the um negative side is it can\n00:08:53.519 also signal we are out of ideas and we\n00:08:55.839 have no iPhones to invent so we're just\n00:08:57.760 giving cash back. For a dividend signal\n00:09:00.800 it could be we are stable. So this would\n00:09:02.720 mean we are reliable cash machine like a\n00:09:05.040 utility company. Um you could count on\n00:09:07.200 us for rent money. A negative side would\n00:09:09.519 be don't expect us to double in size\n00:09:11.600 anymore. Acquisition signal could be we\n00:09:14.560 are hungry. So that could mean we are\n00:09:16.480 getting big on the future AI and VR. The\n00:09:20.399 negative would be we are desperate for\n00:09:22.320 growth and might overpay for it. So\n00:09:25.040 reflecting on everything um my final ver\n00:09:27.920 verdict is I recommend a hybrid\n00:09:30.320 approach. So everything that we saw says\n00:09:33.440 buy back is the easiest but leadership\n00:09:35.839 requires balancing today's stock price\n00:09:37.600 with tomorrow's innovation. So a\n00:09:40.080 balanced approach protects all\n00:09:42.000 stakeholders.\n00:09:43.519 We can execute a $16 billion buyback to\n00:09:46.320 support the share price and satisfy\n00:09:48.080 agency incentives. We can also allocate\n00:09:50.640 $30 billion to strategic acquisition in\n00:09:53.200 AI. And then also a pure buyback signals\n00:09:56.959 a lack of motivation while a pure acquis\n00:09:59.920 acquisition is too risky.\n00:10:03.519 So digging a little deeper, satisfying\n00:10:05.920 the market shortterm\n00:10:07.839 um with allocating $60 billion to\n00:10:10.640 buybacks. This will just keep the share\n00:10:12.480 price high satisfying the CEO's need to\n00:10:14.720 performance metrics. So the EPS and also\n00:10:17.440 our returns excess cash that we can't\n00:10:21.519 efficiently spend elsewhere. Um we could\n00:10:24.720 also protect the future long term. So we\n00:10:26.720 reserve $30 billion for strategic growth\n00:10:29.360 with um acquisitions or R&D. This will\n00:10:32.560 give us 100% buyback and it's as a\n00:10:35.040 signal that Apple has stopped\n00:10:36.480 innovating. Um, by keeping some powder\n00:10:39.920 dry for AR VR investments, we signal\n00:10:42.560 that we are still a growth company. And\n00:10:44.959 then lastly for governance governance\n00:10:47.040 check, we must ensure the co isn't just\n00:10:49.279 boosting EPS to hit a bonus target, but\n00:10:52.399 the board should require the R&D\n00:10:54.240 spending does not drop while this\n00:10:56.000 buyback is happening. But that is all\n00:10:59.360 for my assignment. Thank you."
