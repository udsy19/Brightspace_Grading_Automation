  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies both sides of the trade-off: interest tax shields and increased financial distress risk. They discuss how practitioners quantify these and provide multiple examples/models, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains that leverage boosts potential returns while increasing fixed interest obligations and distress risk, and supports it with an ROE comparison across leverage levels. Given the moderate standard, the conceptual depth plus applied examples/models meets a thorough treatment of how financing choice impacts risk and return.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates validated code execution by showing code presence, stating the code was run, and reporting specific numeric results across multiple examples (ROE values, project recoveries, stakeholder outcomes). These elements across IMPLEMENT and VALIDATE stages meet introductory requirements and show the outputs match the described analyses.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Shows correct conceptual grasp of shareholder–bondholder conflicts and asset substitution, with implemented examples. However, coverage is incomplete: minimal, non-specific identification of winners/losers across options; little on management, employees, or large holders; and no buyback-linked risk-shifting. Depth and stakeholder breadth fall short of a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: Student covers financing value impact (tax shields, distress) and value transfer between stakeholders (asset substitution), supported by implemented examples. However, they do not address signaling effects of buybacks vs dividends vs acquisitions, leaving a noticeable gap, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly discusses key factors (tax shields, distress costs) and illustrates them with models, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not propose a directional capital structure preference (e.g., reduce debt vs. buybacks) supported by those factors. Thus, coverage is correct but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.",
