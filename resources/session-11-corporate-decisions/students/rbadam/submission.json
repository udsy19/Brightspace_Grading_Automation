  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Ronaksai and today I'm\ngoing through my session 11 assignment.\nOkay, so today during my session 11\nassignment, I will show how financing\nchoices creates incentives that shape\ncorporate behavior and then I'll\ndemonstrate three quick models that I\nused uh AI to help me create on Google\nthat quantify the the effects that I'll\ntalk through. So starting with the core\nintuition intuition, financing is not in\ncontrol. Debt amplifies returns to\nequity owners when things go well but\nimposes fixi fixed obligations interest\nthat increases the possibility and cost\nof financial distress when things go\npoorly that creates predictable\nincentive conflicts shareholders\nshareholders as residual claimants offer\nprefer riskier projects because they\ncapture upside while bond holders bear\ndownside. Bond holders therefore demand\nprotections higher yield comments or\ncollateral to counteract that that\nasymmetry. In practice, CFOs and credit\nanalysis analysis\nconfront these trade-offs\nsystematically. They quantify tax\nshields from interest, estimate expected\ncost of distress and stress test cash\nflows across macro scenarios. They also\ndesigned governance mechanisms,\ncovenants,\nboard composition and uh comp\ncomposition executive compensation\nto and um all of this to align\nincentives. So now let me walk through\nmy uh first examples on screen. So you\ncan already see I have um example one on\nscreen. So first it's going to be\nleverage and ro comparison. Um so this\nso far the code that uh that I utilized\nthey had to help me create. So now to\nexplain uh example one. So example one\nis a simple leverage roe comparison. Um\nwe fix a firm's assets EBIT and compare\nROE under no debt, moderate debt and\nhigh debt. This highlights how leverage\namplifies ROE and downside risk. So we\ncan see that down here where ROE under\nleveraged profile. So under no debt the\nroe is is um\nis 20%. Um under moderate debt our roe\nis 32%.\nAnd then under high debt um\nour roe was unable to be computed. So\nNA%\nmoving on to our example two. So these\nare models that uh the classic asset\nsubstitution problem using two different\nproject two projects with different\npayoff distributions. So we compound\nexpected payoffs for share shareholders\nand bond holders and show which project\neach stakeholder prefers. So this makes\nincentive conf incentive conflict\nexpedition. So let's now look at example\ntwo which is asset substitution. So I\nalready ran it. So project A project B\nproject A debt recovery 90,000 B 150,000\nexpected equity residual $0. So\ninterpreter shareholders prefer the\nproject with higher expected equity\nresidual here A and B both have zero.\nAnd then bond holders prefer the project\nwith higher expected debt recovery here\nA 90,000 B 150,000. So B is better for\nbond holders. Okay, now moving on to our\nlast example which is example three. Let\nme scroll down so you guys can see the\ncode here that AI help me write. Um, so\nAI is a restructuring case inspired by\nthe Stormax example. So here we're going\nto parame uh parameterize\ncurrent debt equity and simulate\nthroughruct restructuring options debt\nfor equity swap refinancing at a lower\nrate and asset sales and compute key\nmetrics interest expense net income\nequity dilution or roe. We also print a\nstakeholder impact summary so a\nboardroom viewer can quickly see who\nwins and who loses. So here we can see\nthat our scenarios are up there. Option\none, shareholders diluted ownership but\nlower interest. Option two, no dilution.\nOption three, no dilution at smaller\nfirm. So now we look at our sensitivity\nof option one to conversion amounts and\nthat's our roe. So now that's my session\n11. Thank you.\n\nAllFor you"
