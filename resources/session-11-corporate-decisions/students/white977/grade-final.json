  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly connected the decision to management incentives (EPS optics, option value) and explicitly contrasted preferences across stakeholders, implying potential management–shareholder conflicts and short-term vs long-term trade-offs. Multiple concrete examples (CEO, Berkshire, retail, employees) across DRIVER stages show a strong conceptual grasp appropriate for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly described what the charts/tables showed, citing specific scenario results (EPS impacts, strategic fit ratings, primary goals) and stakeholder impacts. They also verbally explained scenarios and units/calculations, satisfying the criterion at a thorough level across Implement, Validate, and Evolve stages.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the task, objectives, and stakeholder incentives at the start (Discover) and documents represent-stage definitions and stakeholder impacts \"before I dive into my code,\" with implementation described afterward. There is no indication the Discover stage was created post-hoc, so the criterion is met.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission does not identify the interest tax shield or explain that more debt increases financial risk/distress costs. While debt and leverage are mentioned, there is no substantive trade-off analysis, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies divergent incentives for large shareholders, CEO/option holders, employees, and retail investors across buybacks, R&D, acquisitions, and dividends. However, they omit bondholder agency conflicts and do not explain asset substitution or risk-shifting tied to leverage/buybacks, despite noting debt and “leverage” metrics. Given solid but incomplete coverage, this merits a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student briefly mentions “leverage impact” and generic “higher risk/higher reward,” but provides no explanation of how leverage amplifies returns and losses nor how debt adds fixed interest obligations and default risk. Given the lack of depth and missing discussion of debt-driven risk, this falls short of the criterion under a moderate standard.",
