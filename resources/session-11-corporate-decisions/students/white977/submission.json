  "transcript": "Hello, I'm Harry White and today I'll be\ngoing over my session 11 assignment. For\nthis assignment, uh we were tasked with\nevaluating Apple's hypothetical 90\nbillion share purchase using Driver. Uh\nwe were supposed to act as an\nindependent analyst who must determine\nwhether the buyback creates value\nrelative to alternative uses of cash\nwhile balancing stakeholder incentives.\nfor the situation uh liquidity we have\n$165 billion cash in investments and\nhundred billion annual free cash flow.\nThe commod uh the market context we have\n$185 share price. Our price earnings\nratio is 30. Uh the dividend yield is\n0.5% and we have currently 15.5 billion\nshares outstanding.\nUm, for the balance sheet, we have 110\nbillion bad debt. Burks around 6%. Our\nCEO holds 3 million shares. Retail\ninvestors average 100 shares. And\nemployees have $170 strike options. Uh,\nthe proposal, the main one that we were\ngiven is a $90 billion buyback executed\nover one year, which equals 10% of\nmarket cap. and um alternatives. The\nsituations that we have are a $6 special\ndividend, a strategic AI/VR\nacquisition, which we would refer to as\nacquisition throughout this project, a\ndebt reduction alternative, and an\nincremental research and development. Um\nso for my represent stage, basically\njust going over the simple terms, share\nrepurchase is when a company uses cash\nto buy its own outstanding shares in the\nmarket. Um, this is what the $90 million\nbuyback is. And, uh, this increases\nearnings per share for current\nstockholders and often hints towards a\ncompany's confidence and how they are\ndoing. Um, this is one of the situations\nI did. I grew out. Um, so\nfor uh, the buyback impact and basically\nso it goes over each stakeholder group.\nBreakshshire uh, their incentives for\nthis is value appreciation.\num stocks that they currently own will\nappreciate because they own more of the\ncompany now um economic gain tax\nefficient ownership consolidation\nand the impact over here is gain\nlong-term growth to protect the price\nearnings ratio. The CEO who also holds\nthree million who owns $3 million worth\nof shares or sorry has three million\nshares. uh the incentive of stock\noptions, economic gain for the buyback,\nuh earnings per share growth and\nincreases option value and then for over\nhere the risk uh higher risk but higher\nreward if successful in this situation.\nUh retail investors 100 average shares\nhave liquidity income. Uh the economic\ngain provides immediate exit at\nsupported price and it's a risk because\nthere's no immediate return risk of\ngrowth payoff in the future. And then\nthe employees with $170 strike options.\nUm the incentive is stock\noption/retention\neconomic gain over here for the buyback\nimpact. that increases option value,\npushes stock price above strike price\nand over here that's a gain more options\nfor projects and resources and provides\njob security if research and development\nand investment on bigger projects were\ndone. Um, so it can be assumed for\nbefore going over the code that I did in\nGoogle Collab. Um, just some thick quick\nthings to go over. It can be assumed\nthat Berkshire would prioritize the\nbuyback because it increases their\nownership stakes and makes them money.\nEmployees would prefer research and\ndevelopment because it makes their mob\ntheir job more interesting and they are\nthe ones being invested in. In that\nscenario, CEO would also prefer buyback\nbecause it boosts the earnings per share\nmaking them look better in the eyes of\nthe shareholders. And the CEO also owns\nthree million shares\nas you can see over here. Um, given to\nus somewhere right here.\nYep. The CEO holds 3 million shares. Um,\nand\nsorry and retail investors would prefer\nthe special dividend because it provides\nthem with an immediate cash payment. The\naverage price earnings ratio is noted in\nthe market is 20 to 25. So Apple's is\nvery high. This can be seen as promising\nbecause it shows a high estimation of\ngrowth but can scare many away and\novervaluation.\nApple faces pressure to place large\namounts of capital into projects that\ncan deliver high returns in order to\njustify their valuation and the positive\nlight that they see currently in the\nmarket. Um, so this is all the stuff I\nwanted to go over before I dive into my\ncode and calculate and see what the best\ncourse of action as an independent\nanalyst I would choose and tell Apple to\ndo as asked for right here.\nUm so for my implementation Google\ncollab asked it to make me code and\nbasically\num it gave me the\nchanges that all of this over here is\nthe buyback alter or the buyback\nscenario and then the uh dividend\nacquisition debt reduction research and\ndevelopment scenarios and what it does\nto the EPS impact ownership changes\nreturn on investing capital leverage\nstrategic fit ranked and the primary\ngoal of each situation. So as you can\nsee um basically to sum this all up um\nit finds that the acquisition rated as a\nfive at the one out of five strategic\nfit and research and development is a\nfour which are the two highest the\nothers seen as three and two um and it\nshows that buyback the primary goal is\nshare price support and EPS boost over\nhere platform and market expansion the\ngrowth in the future and research and\ndevelopment long- term term organic\ngrowth uh which is important in a market\nlike the tech industry because it is\ncontinuously evolving and innovation is\nneeded to in order to be successful\nlong-term in this market. So this is\nwhat I found as you can see the EPS\nimpact 3.2 here dividend it does not\nchange but acquisition shoots up to\n12.6%\nreduction is only 3.1% and research and\ndevelopment shoots up to 21.4%.\nSo for my validation, I just wanted to\nmake sure all these numbers were correct\nand all of the information associated\nwith it was correct. So obviously\ncalculate the EPS for uh the buyback. Uh\n3.2 is what it got here. And basically I\ncalculated this divide the 90 billion\nbuyback by $185 per stock. Then you\nsorry and then you divide this by the\n15.5 billion shares outstanding and you\nget to 3.2 two rounded which is exactly\nwhat I got. EPS impact, ownership\nchanges, return on investment capital\nimpact, leverage impact. All of these\nmake sense under the circumstances. The\nstrategic fit increases with EPS impact.\nAs you can see here, the two highest\nstrategic fits are with these two. And\nobviously factors in risk and other\nfactors, but uh one of the main goals\nand one of the biggest things shooting\nup strategic fit is the EPS growth.\num and and return on investment capital\nincreases with the addition of new\nphysical investments.\nUm for my evolve stage and basically\njust breaking down what all this says\nand what I took from it and my suggested\npath. Um the 90 billion buyback is\nfinancially is a financially stable move\nand very safe and is also extremely\nappealing to parties like the CEO who\nowns shares and Birkshshire who owns 6%\nof the company originally. Due to the\nhigh price earnings ratio of 30, it is\nbetter to create an approach that mixes\nthe research and development and\nacquisition of alternatives which were\nseen as higher strategic fits. And what\nI agree with in a company like Apple who\ndominates the tech industry but needs to\ncontinue to do so. Um it is better to\ncreate an approach that mixes both\nresearch and development and acquisition\nuh of alternatives to secure higher\nlong-term value creation. It is shown in\nour code that EPS for acquisition and\nR&D provide higher returns than the\nbuyback scenario and the investors and\nthe inventions of new innovative\nproducts that can solidify Apple's\nposition as a long-term competitor in\nthe market. The buyback scenario favors\nshareholder returns over long-term\nsuccess. But this proposition of\nbalancing acquisition and research and\ndevelopment maximize long-term success\nwith shareholder returns because they\nstill are seeing a return if the company\nsucceeds in the long run.\nAnd it is very likely that with putting\nmore\nuh stock or sorry not stock but putting\nmore effort into research and\ndevelopment and\nuh acquisition can help the company out\nmuch better in the long term especially\nwith the high uh price earnings ratio of\n30. They have to solidify themselves\nbecause they clearly right now are\nvalued as a very good company and they\nhave to back up this price earnings\nratio. So as a investment analyst my I\nwould see that um mixing acquisition and\nresearch and development\num is more ideal than executing the $90\nbillion buyback scenario because it\nbenefits the company better in the long\nterm. For my reflection uh in this\nproject I learned the large difference\nbetween value creation and value\ntransfer in corporate finance. Value\ncreation explores a suggestion I\nprovided as an analyst into investing in\nthe future and possible large returns.\nUm I talked about it already but in the\ntech industry that's very important. Uh\nvalue transfer explains the buyback\nscenario where a large portion of\ncompany value is paid to shareholders.\nThe price earning value pay plays a\nlarge part in evaluating this because\nwhen a company holds a large price\nearnings value it means that the company\nis expecting large growth but can also\nbe seen as an overvaluation.\nUm, overall I did enjoy this project. I\nlike diving into a large cong\nconglomerate like Apple who doesn't have\na monopoly on the market but can is seen\nas one of the biggest competitors in the\ntech industry currently. Um, it took a\nlot of tweaks in my code and process. I\nprobably went over three different times\nmaking sure the information was right,\nmaking sure that it's calculating what I\nwanted to and making sure that it is um\ncorrect information that I can interpret\nand turn into my own thoughts.\nUm\nI learned how to deal with large\ncorporations deciding their next course\nof action. And I think this is very\nimportant for me personally, not only\nfor personal investments, but in a\ncareer that I could possibly get into in\nfinance in the future."
