  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly explains how leverage increases ROE by shrinking the equity base while introducing fixed interest obligations and greater distress risk. Multiple DRIVER stages substantiate understanding through modeled scenarios, computations, and theoretical validation, meeting the moderate category’s standard for depth.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly states the Define/Discover stage and documents objectives and fixed inputs (EBIT, tax rate) before describing Representation and Implementation. That clear, chronological demonstration meets the strict requirement that Discover be completed and recorded prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined models, scenarios, and key data inputs before coding (Discover + Represent) and then implemented those specifics in the code (Implement). The transcript shows a direct linkage from planned scenarios and metrics to the implemented calculations and outputs, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly identifies the increased financial risk/distress from debt. However, while taxes are calculated, they never explicitly state the tax benefit/interest tax shield from using debt. Given the moderate standard, this shows correct but incomplete treatment of the trade-off.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies divergent incentives and who benefits or loses from leverage among shareholders, lenders, and managers, linking higher ROE to greater distress risk. However, they do not address employees or large holders, nor do they explain asset substitution, risk-shifting, or buybacks. The treatment is conceptually sound but incomplete, warranting a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly frames financing vs. operating effects and implies value transfer (higher ROE without added operating profit). However, they do not discuss signaling effects of buybacks vs. dividends vs. acquisitions at all. Given the missing signaling coverage, this meets a correct but incomplete standard, warranting PARTIAL.",
