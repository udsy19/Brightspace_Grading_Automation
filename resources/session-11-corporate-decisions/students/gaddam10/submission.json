  "transcript": "0:00\nSo today we'll look at a corporate\n0:01\nfinancial decision analysis for Apple.\n0:04\nSo our first stage to find discover\n0:07\nwe're going to set clear financial\n0:09\nobjectives.\n0:10\nSo the primary objective is to evaluate\n0:13\nApple's hypothetical 9 90 billion share\n0:17\nrepurchase against four alternatives to\n0:19\ndetermine if it creates value for the\n0:21\nfirm and it stakeholders or if it merely\n0:25\ntransfers value while considering agency\n0:27\nand governance implications.\n0:30\nSo some key objectives that we have is\n0:33\nvalue creation. So we have to determine\n0:35\nif the buyback will increase intrinsic\n0:38\nvalue per share\n0:40\num more effectively than the\n0:42\nalternatives. And then two, we have to\n0:44\nlook at the stakeholder impact. So we're\n0:47\ngoing to quantify the immediate and\n0:49\nlong-term effects on retail\n0:51\nshareholders, institutional holders,\n0:54\nmanagement, employees, and also bond\n0:56\nholders.\n0:58\nAnd third, we'll look at capital\n1:00\nstructure and efficiency. So we'll see\n1:02\nhow the buyback and each alternative\n1:04\naffect key metrics like EPS, ROIC, and\n1:08\nleverage such as debt to equity and debt\n1:12\nto EBIT TDA. And then fourth, we'll look\n1:16\nat agency and signaling. So we'll see\n1:19\nhow the governance and signaling\n1:21\nimplications of each capital allocation\n1:23\nchoice. And then is the buyback\n1:26\nprimarily a result of a free cash flow\n1:28\nproblem or a value enhancing\n1:30\nopportunity?\n1:32\nAnd for the code\n1:35\nand the outline, I used Gemini, but I\n1:38\nfilled in the analysis and made sure\n1:40\nthat the calculations were correct and\n1:42\nthe analysis was accurate.\n1:45\nSo some inputs and assumptions. This was\n1:48\nthe data that we were given. So we have\n1:51\nour different metrics\n1:53\nsuch as cash, annual free cash flow,\n1:56\ncurrent share price. So this was the\n1:59\ninformation that we're given and we're\n2:02\ngoing to use these values for our\n2:04\ncalculations and our overall analysis of\n2:07\nwhat Apple should do. Next, our\n2:09\nrepresent stage. So this stage will map\n2:11\nout the model an analysis structure\n2:14\nand so our modeling approach and\n2:17\nparameterization. So first our baseline\n2:20\nmodel. We're going to calculate current\n2:21\nnet income, market cap, and enterprise\n2:24\nvalue. And then second, our buyback\n2:26\nscenario. We're going to calculate new\n2:28\nshares outstanding, new EPS, and new\n2:31\nleverage. And we're going to assume that\n2:33\nbuyback is funded by cash, which would\n2:36\nreduce cost. And then our alternative\n2:39\nscenarios, we're going to model the\n2:41\nimpact of the dividend debt reduction\n2:43\nand a simplified\n2:45\num research and design slacquisition\n2:48\non the same core metrics. And then\n2:51\nfourth, we're going to look at\n2:52\nstakeholder analysis. So we're going to\n2:54\ncalculate ownership percentage changes\n2:56\nfor shareholders and liquidity/solveny\n2:59\nchanges for bond holders. So for our key\n3:02\nformulas, we'll be calculating current\n3:04\nnet income, current EPS, shares we\n3:06\npurchased, new shares outstanding, new\n3:09\nEPS, and the debt to equity ratio. And I\n3:14\nhave the equations listed out here. And\n3:17\nthen next implement that is our code. So\n3:21\nI can show you the code. I already ran\n3:23\nit. So we can see our well, let me\n3:27\nexplain the code first. So here are the\n3:30\ninitial parameters.\n3:32\nSo the value for everything. So our\n3:35\nprice to equity ratio that's 30. Our\n3:38\nexisting debt cash investments. And so\n3:41\nthese are the inputs that we're going to\n3:42\nuse to calculate um our different\n3:45\nequations.\n3:48\nSo we have those calculations here.\n3:51\nAnd then our different scenarios. So\n3:53\nthis one's the buyback scenario\n3:54\nanalysis.\n3:57\nand our alternatives. We have all those\n4:00\nlisted out and then we'll be able to\n4:03\ncalculate the values and then use those\n4:06\nvalues to determine which proposal we\n4:08\nshould go with.\n4:10\nAnd so once we run the code, here are\n4:12\nour values. So our current net income is\n4:14\n95.58\n4:17\nbillion. Our current EPS is $6.17.\n4:22\nOur current market cap is 2,867.5\n4:29\nbillion. And then our current debt to\n4:32\nequity ratio is 0.0384.\n4:36\nAnd then for our buyback proposal, our\n4:39\nshares we purchased um it's about 3.14%.\n4:45\nAnd then our new shares outstanding is\n4:48\naround 15 billion. Our new EPS is $6.37.\n4:54\nOur new debt to equity ratio is 0.0396.\n4:58\nAnd then our Birkshshire ownership is\n5:02\nsix 6.19%.\n5:05\nAnd then down here is our comparative\n5:07\nscenario analysis. So here's our\n5:09\ndifferent scenarios. our shares\n5:11\noutstanding, our EPS, our EPS change\n5:14\npercentage, our equity, our debt to\n5:16\nequity ratio and our value dynamics for\n5:19\neach one.\n5:21\nSo we can see how our shares outstanding\n5:24\ndiffer for each option as well as the\n5:26\nEPS and our EPS change percentage as\n5:29\nwell as the debt to equity ratio\n5:32\nvalidation. So we're going to verify\n5:34\nthat our solutions work correctly. And\n5:37\nso our calculations in the implement\n5:39\nstage mostly verified against financial\n5:42\nprinciples.\n5:43\nSo our shares outstanding\n5:46\num that decreases for the buyback and\n5:48\nit's um around constant with our\n5:50\ndividend. And so um these variables show\n5:54\nthat it's correct. same for EPS and debt\n5:58\nto equity ratio with slightly different\n6:02\nreactions for each category, but they're\n6:06\nall correct.\n6:08\nAnd um so our by our buyback EPS\n6:12\nvalidation, the increase in EPS is\n6:14\npurely mechanical, fewer shares, and\n6:17\ndoes not create firm value. It accretes\n6:19\nvalue per share only if the shares were\n6:21\nundervalued.\n6:22\nAnd the calculation confirms a\n6:24\nmechanical EPS boost. and then dividend\n6:26\nstock price validation. The stock price\n6:29\nis expected to drop by the dividend\n6:31\namount of $6. And this would lead to a\n6:34\nhigher debt to equity ratio or a lower\n6:36\nequity value which the calculation\n6:38\ncorrectly models and then debt reduction\n6:41\nvalidation. The EPS increase is\n6:44\ncorrectly attributed to the reduction in\n6:46\ninterest expense and the debt to equity\n6:48\nratio drops significantly which is the\n6:51\nexpected outcome of deleveraging.\n6:54\nAnd so with our validation, we know that\n6:57\nour model is structurally sound and\n6:59\nadheres to the principles of capital\n7:01\nstructure analysis.\n7:04\nSo now of all we're going to optimize\n7:06\nand improve continuously. So the initial\n7:08\nmodel assumed that constant net income\n7:11\nfor the buyback and a key improvement is\n7:13\nto incorporate the opportunity cost and\n7:16\na more robust value creation versus\n7:18\ntransfer test. So the improvement we are\n7:21\ngoing to incorporate cost of cash and\n7:24\nROIC.\n7:26\nSo the 90 billion cash could have been\n7:29\nused to reduce the existing 110 billion\n7:32\ndebt which has an implicit cost and a\n7:36\ntruly value creating buyback requires\n7:38\nthe firm's ROIC to be greater than its\n7:40\nweighted average cost of capital or in\n7:43\nthis context the stock's implied forward\n7:45\nearnings yield\n7:47\nand this appears to be less than the\n7:49\nfirm's ROIC.\n7:51\nSo the buyback is primarily a value\n7:53\ntransfer from the firm's balance sheet\n7:55\nto the remaining st to the remaining\n7:58\nshareholders and it's value creating\n8:01\nonly if the stock is significantly\n8:03\nundervalued\n8:04\ngiven the price to equity ratio of 30\n8:08\nand so using this value we can see that\n8:11\nthe stock is likely fairly is likely\n8:14\nfair or overvalued so our R&D slash\n8:18\nacquisition\n8:20\nthis is the only option with explicit\n8:21\nvalue creation potential as it targets\n8:24\nfundamental growth and higher future net\n8:26\nincome. Now we'll move on to the reflect\n8:28\nstage. So we're going to be looking at\n8:30\nour recommendation in our overall\n8:32\nconclusion. So our $90 billion share\n8:36\npurchase is the worst value creation\n8:38\nchoice among the five options despite\n8:40\nproviding the highest mechanical EPS\n8:42\naccretion shortterm. It is primarily an\n8:45\nact of value transfer from the balance\n8:47\nsheet um lowering cash reserves to the\n8:50\nremaining shareholders and it signals a\n8:52\nlack of high return investment\n8:54\nopportunities.\n8:55\nSo here's a little table for each\n8:57\noption. So for a buyback proposal the\n9:00\nvalue dynamics the value transfer is\n9:03\naround neutral and it does not leverage\n9:05\nthe firm.\n9:08\nSo the share the stakeholder impact\n9:09\nsummary. So shareholders they increase\n9:12\nownership employees manager and\n9:16\nmanagement they get an increase for EPS\n9:18\nwhich boosts stock price and um benefits\n9:21\nare other options. Bond holders their\n9:24\nsafety decreases as the debt to equity\n9:26\nratio increases.\n9:28\nSo next agency and signaling um there's\n9:32\na lack of growth opportunities and it\n9:35\nsatisfies short-term activist demands.\n9:38\nSo next for our special dividends um our\n9:42\nvalue dynamics it's a pure value\n9:43\ntransfer so immediate payout and then\n9:46\nstock price will drop and then our\n9:49\nshareholders they'll receive their cash\n9:52\nimmediately.\n9:54\nUm for bond holders their debt to equity\n9:56\nratio will go up as there's a lower\n9:58\nmarket cap and then management um\n10:01\nthey'll have less cash for future\n10:04\noptions\n10:05\nand then this is a highly disciplined\n10:07\ncapital return. So high tax cost for\n10:10\nretail shareholders\n10:12\nand then so our strategic R&D\n10:15\nslashacquisition\n10:17\nthis is the strongest value creation\n10:19\npotential so this targets fundamental\n10:21\ngrowth so shareholders this will\n10:24\nincrease long-term value and it has the\n10:26\nhighest EPS and our modeled scenario\n10:30\nand then bond holders they'll have\n10:32\nunchanged leverage initially and an\n10:34\nincrease in safety long term then\n10:37\nemployees SLmanagement.\n10:39\nUm, it aligns with our incentives for\n10:41\nlong-term firm growth. And then our\n10:44\nsignaling, discipline, strategic\n10:46\nattempt, and confidence in future\n10:48\ngrowth, which is our best long-term\n10:50\nchoice. And then debt reduction. There\n10:53\nis a value creation and risk reduction.\n10:56\nUm, saves interest expense with a higher\n10:59\nnet income. So, bond holders increase in\n11:02\nsafety as there as this option has the\n11:04\nlowest debt to equity ratio.\n11:07\nand then shareholders increase in EPS\n11:09\nfrom interest savings and a decrease in\n11:11\nrisk and then management. There's an\n11:14\nincrease in flexibility for future\n11:16\nstrategic debt use and then financial\n11:19\nprudence and commitment to a strong\n11:20\ncredit rating which is our second best\n11:22\nchoice. So now our final recommendation.\n11:25\nSo our final recommendation is to reject\n11:27\nthe $90 billion share buyback\n11:31\nand the strategic R&D/acquisition\n11:34\nwhich is a second alternative is the\n11:36\npreferred choice as is the only option\n11:38\nthat directly addresses value creation\n11:40\nby funding future growth and innovation\n11:43\nwhich is the hallmark of Apple's\n11:44\nhistorical success. And this choice best\n11:48\naligns the incentives of management with\n11:51\nall shareholders and provides the\n11:53\nstrongest positive long-term market\n11:55\nsignal. And if the firm cannot identify\n11:58\na high ROI acquisition, the debt\n12:01\nreduction, which is the third\n12:02\nalternative, is the most prudent\n12:04\nfinancial action. It creates value\n12:06\nthrough interest savings, significantly\n12:08\nreduces financial risk which because it\n12:10\nhas the lowest debt to equity ratio\n12:14\nand maintains a strong cash position for\n12:16\nfuture opportunities\n12:18\ndemonstrate and it also demonstrates\n12:20\nexcellent capital allocation discipline.\n12:23\nSo this is my driver corporate financial\n12:25\ndecision analysis for Apple. Thank you."
