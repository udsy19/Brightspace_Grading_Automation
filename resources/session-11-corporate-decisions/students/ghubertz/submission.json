  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Graham Hubertz doing the\nsession 11 assignment for Management 310.\nSo our assignment today is to evaluate Apple's\nhypothetical $90 billion share repurchase\nusing Driver, act as an independent analyst\nwho must determine whether the buyback\ncreates value relative to alternative uses of\ncash while balancing stakeholder incentives.\nSo our capital allocation snapshot,\nwe have our liquidity, which is $165\nbillion cash and investments, $100\nbillion annual free cash flow, our\nmarket context is $185 share price,\nour PE 30, dividend yield 0.5%,\n$15.5 billion shares outstanding,\nour balance sheet is $110 billion debt,\nBerkshire owns 6%, CEO holds 3 million shares,\nretail investors average 100 shares.\nEmployees have $170 strike options. So our\nproposal is a $90 billion buyback executed\nover one year, 10% of market cap. Our\nalternatives are a $6 special dividend, strategic\nAR slash VR acquisition, debt reduction,\nand incremental R&D. So we must deliver\na recommendation that explains stakeholder\nimpacts, agency considerations, and value\ncreation versus value transfer outcomes.\nso our driver framework requirement driver\nis our analytical work process we begin\nwith to find and discover map your plan and\nrepresent and progress through implement\nvalidate evolve and reflect so I put all this\ninto Google Gemini I said have I have an\nassignment that I need to get done today\nuse the driver framework and kiss principle\nwhen doing this and create Python code\nthat can be exported into collab so i had to\nexport it into collab and i'll go over it\nso number one discover which is understanding\nthe problem in context gold our goals\nto determine if apple's hypothetical 90\nbillion dollar share repurchase creates more\nvalue than alternatives our special dividend\nmna debt reduction r d while balancing\nstocks stakeholder interests so here's our\nkey data snapshot as we already went over.\nSo two, we go into represent modeling\nand defining metrics. Our KISS\nprinciple applied. So we'll focus on the\nimmediate quantifiable impacts and key\nvalidative qualitative, excuse me,\nconsiderations. So our metric is shares are\ntired. Our calculation slash definition is\nbuyback amount and share price. Our rationales\nmeasures the immediate ownership\nconcentration effect our new shares which is our\ncurrent shares minus shares retired core\ninput for eps and ownership change our eps\nimpact is annual fcf over new shares outstanding\nminus current eps which our kiss here\nkeep as simple and stupid as use fcf as\nproxy for earnings for quick and dirty comparison\nour current eps which equals fcf over\nshares outstanding which which equals $100\nbillion over $15.5 billion, which is $6.45.\nOur leverage change, it's debt over\ncash minus buyback amount, which\nmeasures the change in the net cash\nposition. Our ROIC slash P is return\non investment capital over project,\nwhich is a proxy for efficiency of\ncash deployment. Our value creation is\nIRR of the alternative more than WAC,\ntrue long-term value creation versus\nmere financial engineering. So\nthree, implement our Python analysis.\nSo here's our Python\ncode that goes over it,\nour special dividend analysis as well,\nour key metrics, dividend impact on\nshare price, our comparison of alternatives,\nand our alternative debt reduction.\nSo we go into validate, which\nis checking the numbers.\nSo our buyback is $90 billion over $185 per\nshare, which equals 486.5 million shares.\nOur shares outstanding is $15.5 billion\nminus $0.4865 billion, which equals $15.0135\nbillion. Our new EPS is $100 billion over\n$15.0135 billion, which is $6.66. dollars.\nOur EPS accretion is 6.66 minus 6.45, which\nequals 21 cents. The calculated results\nare mathematically sound based on the\ngiven snapshot in FCF as earnings proxy. The\nEPS accretion is guaranteed in a buyback\nwhen the company is buying back shares\nat a lower PE, 30 times the implied PE of\nthe new earnings base, which is always the\ncase in a peer reduction scenario, which\nis assuming constant earnings. So evaluate.\nWe have a recommendation stock stakeholder\nimpact, as this part was hard to read,\nso I'm going to read it off of Gemini.\nSo a pure $90 billion buyback is financially\nattractive, but strategically defensive.\nA $90 billion investment in a high-growth\nR&D slash M&A offers the highest potential\nlong-term value creation but with highest\nrisk the best approach is a hybrid model\ncommit 40 billion dollars to the buyback\nmaintaining discipline and dedicate the\nremaining 50 billion to strategic r d and ai\nvr to drive long-term competitive advantage\nso our stakeholder and agency impact analysis\nwe have our stakeholder buyback impact\nour dividend impact and r d and m a impact\nso our retail shareholders average 100\nshares we have a positive impact as it's\nvalue transfer, immediate EPS boost slash\nhigher share price, taxable event when sold.\nIt's very positive with the dividend\nimpact, immediate certain cash in hand,\n$600 taxed as income, and we have a\nmixed impact, which is for R&D and M&A.\nWe have a high long-term upside\nwith a low negative short-term\nreturns, no immediate cash.\nFor institutional Berkshire, which is 6%\nownership, we have a positive impact. for\nbuyback which our ownership increases from six\npercent to six point three percent we have\na positive impact for dividends which is\nlarge immediate cash infusion and we have\na mixed slash positive impact for R&D and\nM&A which is aligns with long-term value\n-oriented investing so we have for management\nwhich is our CEO three million shares and\nhundred seventy dollar options we have a\nhighly positive impact for buybacks which is\nour EPS accretion is directly improves key\ncompensation metrics, increased chance of\nthe in-the-money options due to higher stock\nprice. We have a positive impact for\ndividends, which is our immediate cash dividend,\nlower tax risk than selling shares, and\nwe have a mixed-slash -neutral impact for R\n&D and M&A, which is no immediate EPS boost.\nThe focus shifts to long-term performance\ntargets. So our employees, we have $170\nstrike options. We have a positive impact for\nbuybacks, which is the immediate share\nprice support slash increase makes their\noptions more valuable. We have a neutral slash\nnegative impact for dividends, which is\nno direct cash benefit to option holders,\ntheoretical price dip, and we have a positive\nimpact for R&D and M&A, which is\npotential for career growth and retention due\nto new strategic focus. For bondholders,\nour $110 debt, $10 billion debt, we have a\nneutral slash slightly negative impact\nfor buybacks, which is the massive cash\ncushion is reduced slightly, increasing leverage\nrisk, which is though still very low.\nWe have a neutral slash slightly negative\nimpact for dividends, which is the same\nreason as buyback, and we have a neutral\nimpact for R&D and M &A, which preserves cash\nwith business risk, increases with R&D.\nSo I'll go back over.\nSo our value creation versus value transfer.\nOur buyback slash dividend value\ntransfer, these are primarily financial engineering\ntools. They transfer value from the\ncompany's balance sheet cash to shareholder\nstock price over cash. They create value\nonly if the company's stock is significantly\nundervalued, which is debatable at\na 30 times P&E, or if the WAC is higher\nthan the return from alternatives. Our R&D\nand M&A value creation, these are strategic\ninvestments. They create new long-term\neconomic value by developing new products,\nmarkets, or defensive capabilities. This\nis a true capital allocation discipline.\nSo our signaling and agency implications.\nOur buyback, we think our stock is cheap.\nAs the market sees us as a confidence\nin stable cash flow, It's a very high risk.\nOur special dividend, we have too much\ncash and you know best how to spend it.\nHighly shareholder friendly, but signals a\nlack of strategic investment opportunities.\nIt's a low risk. And our R&D and M&A, we are\ninvesting for the future and defending our\ncompetitive moat. Signals aggression and a\nfocus on long-term growth. And this is a low\nslash moderate risk. So we go into reflect.\nI'll show that reflection as well for this.\nSo we go into reflector key takeaways. The\n$90 billion buyback is the kiss option,\nsimple, quick EPS accretion, and guaranteed\nshareholder support. However, it represents a\nmissed opportunity to leverage Apple's massive\ncash pile to secure its long-term strategic\nposition in key areas like AI and VR.\nThe ideal capital allocation considering\ncompetitive threats is a blend that balances\nimmediate financial gratification with critical\nfuture-focused investment. And here's the\nrest of my pipeline code, so I'll show it.\nAnd that's it. Thank you for watching.\nThis was my session 11th assignment video."
