  "transcript": "Hey guys, today I'll be doing math session 11 corporate financial decision assignment. So for define and discover the decision problem that we're given is that Apple is considering a $90 billion share repurchase which is roughly 10% of the market cap. So we need to determine does this create firm value or merely transfer value and is it superior to alternative uses of cashes and then the given financial data that we're given is that cash and investment is 165 billion annual free cash flow is 100 billion the share price is 185 each share and then shares outstanding is 15.5 billion the PE value is 30 dividend yield is 0.5% and total debt that Apple has is 110 billion. The key financial questions that we need to discover is what is the EPS impact? What are the leverage changes, ownership consideration shifts, who gains and who loses and then value creation versus value transfer. Okay. So to represent this um I am going to use the inputs which is the share price, the shares outstanding, the buyback amount, the net income, the debt level and then using that I'll get outputs which would be the new share count, the new EPS, ownership percent changes, the debt ratios and the stakeholder wealth effects. So key assumptions would be the buyback executed at 185% per share buyback funded with net first then um debt if needed net income assumed constant in year 1 there's no immediate operating sign from alternatives and the options are in the economy above 170%. Okay now I'll implement the information that we already know into Gemini. So I told Gemini the scenarios that I'm building a corporate financial capital allocation model in in Python to analyze Apple's hypothetical $90 billion share repunk purchase and then I gave it all the datas and then I also told it things that I need and then um to use only pandas numpy and mattpot lib and to not use these um stuff. Okay. And then it gave me the code and then the code. Okay. So I'm going to analyze the code for a bit. So this is like the share price share outstanding um the PE ratio, capital to deploy, the total debt that Apple has, cash on hand, CEO shares owned and the Brookshshire um stake percentage and then this is like all the formulas that it all uses to calculate all the stuff. Okay. So, basically this is the things that I got and now I am going to go onto here and I'm going explain all of this that it gave me. So, based on all of this information, it shows that this model compares five ways Apple could deploy 90 bill 90 billion at a $185 share price. And the five ways are these five. Um the buyback increases EPS from about $6.17 to $6.37 purely by reducing the share count and not raising profits. The other four options leaves EPS flat in short-term because they don't affect shares outstanding. The debt equity rises under the buyback meaning slightly higher financial risk while debt reduction sharply lowers risk. the CEO and Brookshshire um percentages rise under the buyback without buying more shares showing that ownership concentration and agency incentives and then the bar chart confirms visually that only the buyback boost EPS since it is the highest buyback share. So um does EPS rise without operating improvement? Yes, because of the denominator effect. Does leverage increase with depth funded buyback? Yes. Do bond holders face higher risk? Yes. And do option holders benefit from price support? And that's a yes as well. So now I can evolve on this because of the things that I already know. Agency considerations. Select management benefits from higher EPS and stock price driven compensation. The CEO benefits from the 3 million shares appreciating that the CEO has. And then the potential conflict is that buyback may prioritize short-term optics over long-term innovation. The signaling effects is that for the buyback signals, the stock may be over undervalued or Apple lacks high return um reinvestment opportunities. And then the long-term strategy comparison is that the R&D and AI supports competitive mode um acquisition can redefine growth and depth um payown strengthens the balance sheets. So to reflect on everything that I learned and the prompt that um I entered in Gemini and then the Python code that it gave me. So I learned to do not deploy the full 90 billion exclusively to buybacks. So I would recommend doing a partial buyback of roughly 40 billion, a debt reduction roughly 30 billion and then the R&D and AI expansion of 20 billion. Um so why this is superior? Um it preserves the EPS support, reduces the financial risk, maximizes the long-term value creation and aligns management incentives with firm growth. And then it also avoids pure value transfer optics. So the thing I learned is that buybacks often improve metrics without improving operations. Um they also redistribute wealth among stakeholders and governance quality directly affects um valuation outcomes. Thank you."
