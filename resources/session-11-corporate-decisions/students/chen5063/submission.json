So to start with, this is to define the goal is to determine if the 90 billion buyback creates long-term value for the firm or merely transfers it while balancing the conflicting interests of shareholders, management, employees, and bond holders. Here's what represent. We'll be using two equations. First is return on equity with leverage are which is calculated by earning before interest in tax minus interest over equity. And our second equation is degree of financial leverage which is calculated by earning before interest and taxes divided by earning before interest in taxes minus interest. Here's our current input which is also a current matrix. So we have an estimated EBIT of $125 billion. Our interest expense is estimated to $5 billion. Our net income has a is a $120 billion. Our share outstanding is 15.5 billion. Our share price is $185 and our equity value is 2.8675 trillion dollars. Our total asset is estimated to $500 billion. Our tax rate is an employed of 20%. Here's our buyback plan which is also base case of $90 billion. So shares purchased is $486 million. Our new shares outstanding is 15.014 billion. Here's a financing assumption. The $90 billion is funded by cash and investments leading to a directed reduction in the equity components of the balance sheet. So this is a code that I asked Google Gemini to help me um create that represents the cases different options that Apple can use. So um to start with the shareholder and management incentives which are EPS focused we have our first option option A or first option which is a base option buyback. The model shows the buyback yields a significant EPS increase of 3.24% making it immediately accurative. And here our second case is option C um which our acquisition is that it assumes a high ROIC the acquisition provides the largest EPS boost which is approximately 9.38%. And our third is option D which is R&D. Um this is the model shows the R&D option is highly dilutive in the short term with a drop of approximately 75% because R&D is an immediate expense. So from the shareholders and management incentives our model confirmed that why the buyback is so popular among shareholders and management it provides an immediate guarantee boost to the EPS matrix directly benefiting stock option value. Conversely, R&D despite its potential for long-term value creation is a financial non-starter for management due to its massive short-term EPS hit. And our other options are bond holder incentives which are leverage risk focused. So we have a depth deduction option B. The model shows that it is only option that me measurably reduces financial leverage which DFL improves from 1.04 to 1.01 making the firm safer and more secure for bond holders and other options such as buyback acquisition or R&D. These options leave the formulaic DF unchanged but we validate that the buyback inherently increases the balance sheet risk. So from the bond holders perspective the DAP reduction option is the undis undisputed winner. It reduces the formula financial leverage and improves credit matrix reducing the risk of their investment. The buyback conversely is viewed negatively as it pulls capital out of the firm making the depth structure relatively riskier. And going to the validate part. So the first step of validation is to ensure the model's mass is logically consistent with our assumption. We validated the small EPS increase from depth reduction is correctly smaller than the bybacks EPS boost. This is consistent because depth reduction is benefits that depth reduction benefit is on the only excuse me the only interest tax shield saving whereas the buyback benefits from both tax shield loss and fewer shares outstanding. SN or to acquisition validation. We validate the acquisition's high EPS entirely dependent on our assumption of a high ROIC. If the ROIC is low, that option immediately becomes dilutive. The quantitative outcome validates the execution risk we assign to that option. And the sec the next step in validation is cross-checking the calculated financial impacts that the predicted ch shareholders behavior. The quantitative data from the implement step perfectly validates our incentive map. The option that maximize short-term financial matrix which are BPAC buyback acquisition are preferred by those with short-term compensation incentive which are in this case are management and employees while the option that maximize financial safety which are depth reduction is preferred by the lowrisk creditors which in this case are bond holders. So here's is another visualization that I asked Google Gemini to generate for me. Um so this is a dual axis visualization comparing EPS which are shareholder focus and DFL which are bond holder focus across all options. So the visual analy analysis serves as a final validation. It clearly maps the stakeholder conflicts. We see the um depth reduction option sitting at the lowest DF outl but lower EPS. Meanwhile, the buyback and acquisition sit high on the EPS axis confirming that one cannot optimize for both maximum maximum return EP and minimum risk. And simultaneously the chart sorry. So um we confirmed that one cannot optimize for both maximum return and minimum risk simultaneously. This geographically confirms the trade-offs we established. Going on to evolve. So the analysis reveals the core agency conflict which first of all is the managers versus shareholders. So the buyback is attractive to management and employees because the of the immediate EPS accretion and the share price support boost their compensation at the expense of long-term R&D investment but in this case it also harms short-term EPS and shareholders versus bond holders. So the buybacks increase in financial leverage is a negative signal to the bond holders increasing the risk without a corresponding increase in yield. Depth reduction is optimal outcome for bond holders. The buyback appears to be a value transfer from the cash balance to current shareholders and management or employees by using financial engineering to inflate EPS rather than a true value creation activity which such as the high ROIC acquisition or R&D. This highlights a lack of capital allocation discipline discipline if Apple truly has a high ROIC internal project. So coming to our reflection first our final recommendation is that Apple should pursue option B which are depth reduction or option C which are strategic AI/VR acquisition and not the $90 billion buyback. And the reasons why is that first depth reduction is this is the most financially disciplined choice. It reduces agency cost of depth and financial distress risk which is a form of value creation by securing the firm's financial flexibility and cre um and reducing the weighted average cost of capital. It satisfies bond holders and maintains a conservative capital structure. And second, the strategic acquisition if and only if a high ROIC target can be identified. This rep this option represents the highest potential for value creation. This aligns with the long-term strategic growth and satisfies the shareholders desire for innovation despite the higher execution risk. So to conclude on the buyback, the buyback is a defensive short-term mechan mechanism that serves the immediate interest of management which are EPS linked compensation and shareholders seeking a tax efficient return but it increases the firm's financial risk and may indicate a failure of governments to enforce the pursuit of high ROIC growth projects. a primarily a it is primarily a value transfer mechanism. Thank you so much."
