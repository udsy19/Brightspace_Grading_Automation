  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly states the objective, scope, stakeholders, constraints, and labels the Defined/Discover stages before announcing the Represent stage and baseline calculations. This clear, sequential documentation satisfies the criterion that Define & Discover were completed and documented prior to modeling.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly specified scenarios, success metrics, and data needs before implementation and then carried those into concrete calculations (net income/EPS), with validation of results. This shows a systematic plan-to-implementation linkage consistent with the DRIVER framework.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student shows a clear plan (Represent), carries out specific, traceable calculations in the Implement stage, and performs validation checks tying results back to goals and theory. This systematic workflow meets the moderate standard for implementation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student recognizes that leverage increases financial risk and implicitly applies the interest tax effect via after-tax interest savings. However, they do not explicitly articulate debt’s tax shield as a benefit or discuss distress costs, and the treatment is brief. Under moderate standards, this supports a correct but basic understanding—hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies divergent incentives for buybacks (management/employees benefit via options and dilution reduction; bondholders lose as leverage/risk rises) and ties this to risk-shifting. However, they do not comprehensively cover who gains/loses across the other options (dividend, debt paydown, R&D, acquisition), do not discuss large holders, and do not explain asset substitution dynamics. Thus, understanding is present but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly notes that leverage raises risk and shows EPS effects, indicating a basic understanding of how financing choices affect return and risk. However, the treatment is not thorough: it lacks explicit discussion that debt adds fixed interest obligations and increases default risk, and includes some confusion about financing with no new debt. Thus, the coverage is correct but basic, warranting PARTIAL.",
