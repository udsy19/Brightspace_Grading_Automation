So we're\ndeciding what formulas\n\n33\n00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,810\nwe need to calculate\nearnings per share,\n\n34\n00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,910\nhow our share count\nchanged under buybacks,\n\n35\n00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,400\nhow dividends\nreduce cash, and how\n\n36\n00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,350\ndebt reduction lowers\nour interest expense\n\n37\n00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,570\nand how stakeholder\nwealth changes.\n\n38\n00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,350\nSo we're building\na framework\n\n39\n00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,470\nthat can run multiple\nscenarios and\n\n40\n00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,050\ncompare them\napples to apples.\n\n41\n00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,290\nSo here we go.\nHere's all our cases.\n\n42\n00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,730\nHere's all our formulas.\n\n43\n00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,750\nuh,\n\n44\n00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,270\net cetera, et cetera,\n\n45\n00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,930\net cetera. So now that\nwe are, let's keep\n\n46\n00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,050\ngoing. So now we are\ngoing to, uh, run our\n\n47\n00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,390\nscenarios. So again,\nwe have our, we do\n\n48\n00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,650\nnothing. We buy back\nshares. We do dividends,\n\n49\n00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,950\ndebt reduction, we\nacquire new companies,\n\n50\n00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,670\nor we have R and D.\nSo for For each one of\n\n51\n00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,090\nthese, for each of\nthe six scenarios, we\n\n52\n00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,670\nneed to calculate\nearnings per share, our\n\n53\n00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,370\nshare price, our market\ncap, our cash and debt\n\n54\n00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,530\nlevels, our net cash,\nour leverage, and\n\n55\n00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,970\nthe value added to\neach stakeholder group.\n\n56\n00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,830\nSo now we're\ngoing to validate.\n\n57\n00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,150\nSo do our results\nmake sense?\n\n58\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,230\nSo do stakeholder\nvalues behave logically?\n\n59\n00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,750\nDoes our earnings\nper share go\n\n60\n00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,750\nup after buybacks?\nshould do high\n\n61\n00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,090\nROI investments,\nbeat buybacks.\n\n62\n00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,310\nSo basically, we're\nmaking sure our\n\n63\n00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,490\nmodel isn't giving\nnonsense results.\n\n64\n00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,790\nWe're sure our\nmath is right.\n\n65\n00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,310\nSo now we're evolving.\n\n66\n00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,090\nWe are exploring,\nso we're going\n\n67\n00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,070\nbeyond. We're exploring\nwhat-if scenarios,\n\n68\n00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,650\nlike what if\nApple bought back\n\n69\n00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,430\n$30 billion instead\nof $90 billion?\n\n70\n00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,810\nwhat if the ROIC was\n\n71\n00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,890\nonly 8% instead of 12%?\n\n72\n00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,010\nWhat if our\nentrance rates rise?\n\n73\n00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,370\nSo we're showing our\nability here to adapt\n\n74\n00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,390\nthe model and analyze\nmore realistic,\n\n75\n00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,830\nchallenging scenarios\nthat we could face.\n\n76\n00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,250\nAnd now we're\ngoing to reflect.\n\n77\n00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,970\nSo as we're\nreflecting, we are...\n\n78\n00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,410\nwe are deciding\nwhat we should\n\n79\n00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,210\ndo and so basically\nwe need to\n\n80\n00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:22,090\nprioritize high\nROI investments\n\n81\n00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,670\nso that could be AI,\nVR, or research and\n\n82\n00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,270\ndevelopment and then\nafter those we try to\n\n83\n00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,450\nmaintain a smaller\nongoing share buyback.\n\n84\n00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,410\nSo we don't want to buy\nback $90 billion all\n\n85\n00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,670\nat once. So the buyback\nhas a weak return,\n\n86\n00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:48,980\nonly 3.3%. As we see\nhere, that is below\n\n87\n00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,550\nour ROICs on our\ninvestments, which are\n\n88\n00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,650\nlike 12 and 15%. So\nthat's not... However,\n\n89\n00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,030\nour high ROIC investments\ncan create real\n\n90\n00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,650\nvalue as we see every\ndollar invested at 12\n\n91\n00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,170\nto 15% ROIC come\ncompounds far faster than\n\n92\n00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,690\nthe dollars used to\nbuy back our stock\n\n93\n00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,030\nthe 90 billion dollar\nbuyback really only\n\n94\n00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:24,270\nbenefits the inside like\nworkers stuff Employee\n\n95\n00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,650\nstock options, CEOs,\nstuff like that.\n\n96\n00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,430\nThat is really only\nwhat the buyback does.\n\n97\n00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,290\nThe debt reduction\nisn't bad. It\n\n98\n00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,320\nsaves on interest\ncosts, but it doesn't\n\n99\n00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,770\nsave enough to\njustify doing it.\n\n100\n00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,710\nAnd our special\ndividend to pay another\n\n101\n00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,890\ndividend is the\nleast strategic.\n\n102\n00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,070\nIt gives shareholders\ncash, but it\n\n103\n00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,030\ndoesn't improve our\nearnings per share.\n\n104\n00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,170\nIt doesn't change\nany innovation.\n\n105\n00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,630\nWe're basically\nsaying we're done.\n\n106\n00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,030\nSo we want to\ninvest heavily\n\n107\n00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,630\nin high ROIC investments.\n\n108\n00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,570\nWe want to run some\nbuyback programs, which\n\n109\n00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,470\nprevents dilution and\nreturns excess cash.\n\n110\n00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,690\nYeah, that's basically\nit. So thank you."
