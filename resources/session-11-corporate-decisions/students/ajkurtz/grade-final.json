  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes a base set of scenarios plus explicit sensitivity checks (e.g., $90B vs $30B buyback, ROIC 8% vs 12%, interest-rate changes) and quantifies comparative returns (buyback 3.3% vs investments 12–15%). The student also draws stakeholder-impact conclusions and contrasts outcomes, satisfying the requirement to identify where preferences shift (favoring high-ROIC investment over large buybacks).\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly captures the Define/Discover stage up front (problem, goal, stakeholders/data gathering) and then states the Represent stage where the modeling approach is defined, meeting the requirement that D-stage is completed and documented before modeling. Evidence shows clear, sequential DRIVER stage articulation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly described the models, scenarios, metrics, and specific data inputs before running analyses and then tied those planned elements to the implemented scenario runs and computed outputs. This systematic mapping from representation to implementation meets the moderate-standard PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student never identifies the interest tax shield from debt nor the increased financial risk/distress costs, only noting that debt reduction saves interest. Despite mentioning leverage and debt levels, the capital structure trade-off is not discussed, so the criterion is not met.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies who benefits under certain options (insiders via buybacks, shareholders via dividends) and gestures at stakeholder trade-offs, but coverage is incomplete and lacks depth. They do not discuss bondholders, large holders, or explain asset substitution/risk-shifting tied to leverage and buybacks, so the treatment is basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student notes interest expense and intends to calculate leverage, but does not explain how leverage amplifies returns (EPS/ROE) and risks, nor do they mention that debt’s fixed interest increases default/bankruptcy risk. Given the lack of discussion on leverage’s risk-return amplification, this falls short of the required conceptual coverage.",
