  "transcript": "Okay, so this is session number 11.\nUm, so we were tasked with Apple sits on\na $165 billion in liquidity with 100\nbillion annual FCF. Um, the proposal is\na $90 billion share repurchase, which is\napproximately 10% of the market cap. And\nwe must determine if this creates\nintrinsic value or just transfers it. So\nI have a stakeholder map. Um so we have\nmanagement institutions, retail\ninvestors and bond holders. So\nmanagement's interest stock price and\nEPS and their incentive is high because\noption strike is $170\nand buybacks mechanically boost EPS and\nsupport price floors.\num institutions interest is ownership\npercentage and their incentive is also\nhigh because they prefer buybacks to\navoid taxes on dividends and increase\npercent ownership for free. So for\nretail investors their interest is\nincome versus growth. um their incentive\nis mixed because some want cash and\nothers want capital gains\nand bond holders their interest is\nsolveny and their incentive is neutral.\nUm $165 billion cash buffer means $90\nbillion spend creates a zero default\nrisk. So the question is does buying\nback stock at a three times PE ratio\ngenerate better returns than a special\ndividend or strategic acquisition.\nSo for um I took an analytical approach\num I'm comparing the status quo against\nthree capital allocation alternatives\nusing a Python model to test the EPS\naccretion and shareholder yield. So for\nmy logic model um the inputs are share\nprice which is $185\nshares are 15.5 billion billion shares\nand net income is implied from the PE um\nmechanism. So new share count equals the\nold count minus cash used divided by\nshare price\nand a creative EPS equals net income\ndivided by new share count. Um so the\nscenarios are scenario A which is the\nbuyback. Um scenario B which is special\ndividend and scenario C which is\nstrategic acquisition.\nSo for my implementation I have this\nPython code.\nSorry\nI'm going to run it again.\nThere it is.\nUm, so here we're just defining our\ninputs and assumptions. Our current\nprice is $185. Just like I said, here\nare shares outstanding. P ratio is 30\nand our cash deployment is 90 billion.\nSo some of our derived metrics from what\nwe were given, our current EPS is our\ncurrent price divided by the PE ratio.\nWe also have net income equaling um\ncurrent EPS times shares outstanding.\nThen we also have current market cap\nequaling current price times shares\noutstanding.\nThen we also have some scenario\ncalculations.\nUm so for scenario A, you can see here's\nour calculations for that. So, we're\ndoing shares repurchased equaling cash\ndeployment divided by current price. New\nshares buyback equaling shares\noutstanding minus shares repurchased.\nAnd the EPS buyback equaling net income\ndivided by new shares buyback.\nUm so we also have an ownership\nconcentration increase um for those\ninstitutions.\nSo ownership increase PCT\num is shares outstanding divided by new\nshares buyback minus one.\nOkay. So we also have scenario B which\nis our special dividend. Um so share\naccount stays the same. Shareholders get\ncash. So, we're just calculating our\ndividend per share, our EPS dividend,\nand our total value dividend. You can\nsee\nthose um formulas there.\nUm our operations don't change for that\nEPS dividend. It's just the current EPS.\nAnd the theory behind the total value\ndividend is price drops by dividend\namount, but total wealth is the sum.\nSo scenario C, strategic acquisition.\nUm, so our assumption is that the\nacquisition generates 10% ROIC.\nUm,\nit's also a riskier assumption than a\nbuyback.\nSo you can see our formulas for added\nearnings, which is cash deployment times\n0.1. And then we also have our EPS for\nthe acquisition which is net income plus\nadded earnings divided by shares\noutstanding.\nSo then you can just see that's going to\nbe printed out into the output data\nframe and we also have visualization.\nSo\nokay. So as you can see here we have\nmetric status quo buyback and special\ndividend\nand then the acquisition got put down\nhere.\nUm so as you can see the EPS for the\nstatus quo 6.17 buyback act 6.37\nspecial dividend still still 6.17 cuz\nthat does not change and the acquisition\nis 6.75.\nThe share count is the same for\neverything except for the buyback which\nis 15.01 01\nand the shareholder yield is\n0.5\n3.6\n3.6 and NA.\nSo then we also have an impact on\nearnings per share by strategy um little\nchart. So as you can see here\num the highest EPS is with the\nacquisition and the lowest is status quo\nand the buyback is somewhere in the\nmiddle.\nSo it's just a helpful chart to\nvisualize.\nSo as you can I put the same Python code\nthat was outputed into a table in here\nis the same one.\nUm so the buyback guarantees a\n20 cent EPS increase risk-free. Um the\nacquisition looks superior but assumes\nperfect integration and immediate\nprofitability and so this carries a high\nexecution risk.\nUm the dividend offers immediate cash\nbut forces a taxable event on\nshareholders and offers no structural\nimprovement\num to the financial ratios.\nSo there's some there's just a valuation\nrisk. So buying back stock at three\ntimes earnings is expensive. Um\nthe risk um is if the market corrects\nand the PE drops to 20 times. Um then we\nspent $90 billion buying overvalued\npaper essentially. Um the mitigate to\nthis is that we're reducing the float\nwhich theoretically supports the floor\nprice. So my final recommendation is to\napprove the buyback with with some\nmodifications.\nUm so I would execute a $60 billion\nbuyback and reserve $30 billion for\nstrategic R&D/acquisitions.\nUm my justification for this so it\naligns with our stakeholders. Um it\nsatisi satisfies management and\ninstitutional investors better than a\ndividend would. Um for value transfer it\nsafely transfers cash to shareholders by\nincreasing their percent ownership.\nAnd for risk management, avoiding a full\n$90 billion spend preserves some cash\nfor investments which mitigates\nsignaling signaling to investors that\nApple is not growing. So that is session\nnumber 11."
