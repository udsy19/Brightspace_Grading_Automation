  "transcript": "0:05\nHi, I'm Addison Nichols. This is my\n0:06\nsession 11 assignment. So, the goal of\n0:09\nthis assignment is to evaluate Apple's\n0:10\nhypothetical 90 billion share\n0:12\nrepurchase. So, we want to determine\n0:14\nwhether it creates value relative to\n0:16\nalternative uses of cash while balancing\n0:18\nstakeholder incentives and give a final\n0:21\ndecision as to which one is the best to\n0:22\nchoose. So parameters that we're given\n0:25\num our liquidity is 165 billion in cash\n0:28\ninvestments and we have 100 billion in\n0:30\nannual free cash flow. Our market\n0:33\ncontext is that it is currently 185\n0:35\nshare price um PE of30 dividend yield\n0:38\nof.5%\n0:40\n15.5 billion shares outstanding um and\n0:43\nwe currently have 110 billion of debt.\n0:45\nBirkshshire owns 6% the CEO holds 3\n0:48\nmillion shares. Retail investors average\n0:50\n100 shares and employees have $170 in\n0:53\nstrike options. Our current proposal is\n0:56\n90 billion buyback executed over one\n0:58\nyear which is about 10% of the market\n1:00\ncap with the alternatives of a $6\n1:02\nspecial dividend strategic AR or VR\n1:05\nacquisition debt res debt res debt\n1:08\nreduction increment and incremental\n1:10\nresearch and development. So our market\n1:13\ncap is our share price times the amount\n1:15\nof shares outstanding which ends up\n1:17\nbeing about 2.87 87 trillion. Our\n1:19\nearnings per share are calculated as the\n1:21\nshare price divided by our P/E, which is\n1:24\n$6.17.\n1:26\nAnd so therefore, our applied implied\n1:28\nnet income is 6.7, which is that um\n1:31\nearnings per share times our outstanding\n1:34\nshares, which ends up being $95.6\n1:36\nbillion. So that's it for the define and\n1:38\ndiscover portion. Moving on to the\n1:40\nrepresent, we're just going to go over\n1:41\nthe scenarios and kind of what they\n1:43\nmean. So in the buyback scenario, we\n1:45\nhave our cash, we buy the shares, our\n1:47\nshare count then drops, our shares\n1:49\noutstanding, which um usually means the\n1:51\nearnings per share and the share price\n1:53\nrises because there's more of a scarcity\n1:55\nof them and because of that the share\n1:57\nprice will rise. In our dividend\n1:59\nscenario, we take that cash, pay the\n2:01\nshare, no change in share count. Um and\n2:04\nthen the stock price will usually drop\n2:06\nby the dividend amount. In our strategic\n2:08\nacquisition, we will buy that tech with\n2:10\nthe cash with and that will result in a\n2:13\nhigh risk with a potential return on\n2:14\ninvested capital, but there's no way to\n2:16\nknow for sure. In debt reduction, we\n2:19\nwill take that cash and pay off our\n2:20\nportion of the debt. Um, so we will have\n2:23\n20 billion in debt remaining after that.\n2:25\nAnd what that benefit is is obviously\n2:28\nhaving less debt and also saving tax on\n2:31\nthat debt. Um and then our incremental\n2:33\nresearch and development. We would use\n2:35\nthat cash to invest in research and\n2:37\ndevelopment over time which does have a\n2:39\npotential for return on invested\n2:41\ncapital. However, it does have risk with\n2:43\na potential long-term cash flow. So how\n2:46\neach like kind of investor feels about\n2:48\nthis retail shareholders are pretty\n2:50\nneutral on the buyback. They would enjoy\n2:52\nthe dividend. Um, and then they for the\n2:57\nAI/VR, they would be pretty neutral\n2:59\nsince it is a risky take on for the debt\n3:01\npayment. They wouldn't be as big of a\n3:04\nfan as it because they don't gain\n3:05\nanything from it. And for the incre\n3:07\nincremental development, again, they\n3:09\ndon't really gain anything out of it.\n3:11\nInstitutional holders would enjoy the\n3:13\nbuyback. Um, their share price would go\n3:15\nup and then they could sell it at a\n3:16\nhigher value. For a dividend, they don't\n3:18\nreally benefit from that as much. the AI\n3:21\nVR acquisition. Again, it's more of a\n3:24\nrisk that they're taking on. Um, and\n3:26\nthen for the debt, they would feel more\n3:28\nnegatively about it. They don't gain\n3:30\nanything. And same with the incremental.\n3:32\nUm, regarding the buyback, that would be\n3:35\nsomething that management would\n3:36\nappreciate, especially since we do know\n3:38\nthat they have the $170 strike options.\n3:41\nSo, when the market context or the share\n3:44\nprice goes up, they can sell those for\n3:46\nmore of a profit. They get more of a\n3:48\nprofit out of that. um dividends they\n3:51\nwouldn't feel as positively about um and\n3:54\nthey would enjoy the AI or VR or the\n3:56\nincremental because that could create\n3:58\nmore opportunities for them since it's\n4:00\nwithin the company internally and then\n4:02\nfor the debt they would feel pretty\n4:03\nneutral about it. Um employees would\n4:06\nenjoy the buyback, the AR and VR\n4:08\nacquisition in the incremental. Um the\n4:11\nAR and VR acquisition and the research\n4:13\nand development would again create more\n4:15\nopportunities and have the potential for\n4:17\ngrowth for the company. And the buyback\n4:19\nagain with the um\n4:23\nwith the um strike options, they would\n4:26\nget more of a profit when the share\n4:28\nprice goes up. And then regarding the\n4:30\ndividend and the debt, they're pretty\n4:31\nneutral towards that. bond holders would\n4:34\nonly really appreciate the debt because\n4:36\nthat means there's less of a risk in\n4:37\ntheir bond holding. They the company\n4:40\nlikely won't default on what they're\n4:42\nowed and then everything else they don't\n4:44\nreally gain a lot from. So they feel\n4:46\nmore negatively about those. So the\n4:48\nimpact of each of these scenarios just\n4:51\nto lay that out for the represent\n4:53\nportion buyback will increase our EPS\n4:55\nimpact. It will concentrate ownership\n4:57\nchanges to shareholders. It will\n5:00\nartificially boost our return on\n5:01\ninvested capital. There will be a slight\n5:04\nincrease in leverage. Um and then with a\n5:06\nstrategic fit, it will return cash with\n5:09\nslow internal growth and it signals to\n5:12\nlike people looking that they believe\n5:14\nthey are undervalued and it will\n5:16\ntransfer value. Dividends will not\n5:18\nreally have an EPS impact or ownership\n5:20\nchange or return on invested income\n5:22\nimpact. It will slightly increase\n5:24\nleverage. It will signal commitment to\n5:27\nshareholders and it will say that we are\n5:29\nstable and committed to regular investor\n5:31\nincome regarding signaling and transfer\n5:34\nof value. The AI and VR acquisition will\n5:37\nincrease EPS if successful. There won't\n5:39\nbe a change in ownership. Um and it will\n5:42\nhave the highest potential for return on\n5:44\ninvested capital leverage. It could be\n5:47\noffset by new assets. It just depends\n5:49\nhow it goes. The strategic fit it is\n5:51\naggressive growth and it basically says\n5:53\nwe see a huge growth opportunity and\n5:55\ncreates value. Debt will have a slight\n5:58\nincrease in EPS won't really affect\n6:00\nownersship changes. The return on\n6:02\ninvested capital is the interest rate\n6:04\nsaved will decrease leverage since there\n6:06\nis less debt. Um strategically it's\n6:09\nsafety and risk management and it\n6:11\nsignals that they're too risky of a\n6:13\ncompany and so it will create value\n6:15\nbecause it reduced cost of capital. The\n6:18\nincremental research and development\n6:20\nwill have a minimal impact on EPS. Won't\n6:22\nhave an impact on ownership. Um has a\n6:25\nhigh potential for return on invested\n6:27\ncapital. Again, has a risk of failure.\n6:30\nLeverage could be offset by the new\n6:31\nassets. Gradual growth is the strategic\n6:34\nfit and it says that we are confident in\n6:36\nthe future and technology technological\n6:39\nsuperiority. So it will create value. So\n6:42\nmoving on from that, those are basically\n6:44\nthe scenarios laid out and how each one\n6:46\naffects people who invest regardless of\n6:49\nkind of if they're bond holders,\n6:51\nshareholders, employees or anything else\n6:53\nand how it impacts certain business\n6:55\nmetrics. So moving on to the implement\n6:56\nportion, we are going to look at um how\n7:01\nthis kind of presents itself. So for\n7:03\nApple cash investments or this first\n7:05\ncell, it'll basically lay out what we\n7:08\nare told in the parameters. So this is\n7:10\nstuff that we went over in the define\n7:11\nportion. Going through here, um it's\n7:14\ngoing to use financial functions to\n7:16\ncalculate a few different parameters\n7:18\nusing those given things. Um so we're\n7:20\ngoing to get shares repurchase, shares\n7:22\noutstanding, the new one, new earnings\n7:24\nper share, and those will present in the\n7:28\nnext one from the buyback scenario\n7:30\nanalysis. So what this will do is it'll\n7:32\ngive us our baseline net income, which\n7:34\nis about 95 billion. the shares\n7:37\nrepurchased like how much we can afford\n7:38\nto repurchase with that 90 billion is\n7:40\ngoing to be 486\n7:43\nmillionish\n7:45\nsomewhere like 48.6\n7:48\n486.5 million about that um that's how\n7:52\nmuch we're going to repurchase. So after\n7:55\nthat, our new shares outstanding is\n7:57\nabout 15 billion and our new earnings\n8:00\nper share is $6.37\n8:02\nand we have a new debt to equity figure\n8:04\nratio of 04. So that's just kind of the\n8:08\nparameters for the buyback scenario how\n8:09\nit shows itself. Um and then what this\n8:13\ncell will do is look at the dividend and\n8:15\ndebt reduction scenarios. So total\n8:18\ndividend payout is going to be about 93\n8:20\nbillion. So our new total, so our X\n8:23\ndividend share price is $179.\n8:26\nAnd then regarding the debt reduction,\n8:29\nwe will have 20 billion in debt after we\n8:31\nuse all of that 90 billion cuz we start\n8:33\nwith 110 billion in debt. Um we are\n8:36\nassuming an interest rate of 3.5 on the\n8:39\ndebt. We're not given any. So this is\n8:41\njust an assumption. We would save about\n8:43\n3 billion on annual interest and then\n8:46\nour new debt to equity ratio for that\n8:48\nwould be 01.\n8:50\nSo then looking at a graph um our debt\n8:53\nto equity ratio comparison across\n8:56\nscenarios we see the highest with the\n8:57\nshare buyback and the lowest with the\n8:59\ndebt reduction. Um so then moving on to\n9:03\nanother graph we're going to look at the\n9:05\nearnings per share and then we see the\n9:08\nhighest with the share buyback as\n9:09\ncompared to the baseline. So again, our\n9:11\nbaseline earnings per share is $6.17.\n9:16\nAnd then for our new buyback scenario,\n9:19\nit ends up being $6.37.\n9:22\nThen our next graph, it's going to show\n9:24\nshares outstanding across scenarios. Um\n9:27\npretty basically we just see lower\n9:29\nshares outstanding with the share\n9:30\nbuyback because we have um taken them\n9:34\nback from shareholders bought them back\n9:37\nand therefore we have less outstanding.\n9:40\nSo moving on from the implement portion\n9:43\nfor the validate portion I thought I'd\n9:45\njust do kind of like a sanity check. So\n9:47\nwe have $165 billion in cash. We're\n9:50\nspending 90 billion. That means we have\n9:51\n75 billion left. So we make h 100red\n9:54\nbillion every year. So after spending\n9:56\n90, we still have 75 which can run the\n9:59\ncompany without going bankrupt. So this\n10:00\nscenario is solveny validated. Like this\n10:03\nisn't an unrealistic thing to be looking\n10:05\nat with spending the $90 billion.\n10:11\nRegarding the evolve portion, I think\n10:13\nthis can be looked at as a mix of\n10:15\nscenarios instead of just choosing one\n10:17\nbecause 90 billion is a lot and we don't\n10:20\nhave to put that all into one scenario.\n10:22\nSo, you know, each scenario has its\n10:24\nbenefits and drawbacks. None of them are\n10:26\ngoing to make everyone absolutely happy.\n10:28\nSo, what we could do is we could buy\n10:30\nback less shares and we could invest a\n10:32\nlittle bit in research and development\n10:34\nor the AI in VR. And that way we create\n10:37\nkind of um this potential future cash\n10:39\nflow, but we're not putting all of our\n10:41\neggs in one basket. It's like when you\n10:43\nbuy stocks, you don't put all your money\n10:45\ninto one stock. You spread it out across\n10:47\nlike an index fund. So I think that's\n10:49\nsomething that could be looked at for\n10:51\nthis evolve portion and something that\n10:53\nwould be beneficial with such a large\n10:54\nsum like $90 billion. Um but regarding\n10:59\nthe reflect portion my final red\n11:01\nrecommendation would be to approve the\n11:03\n90 billion buyback. So what this does it\n11:05\nbalances the needs of stakeholder\n11:07\nwithout introducing unnecessary risk.\n11:09\nAgain, 90 billion is a lot to be putting\n11:12\ninto an AI or VR acquisition in itself\n11:15\nand that could just be totally\n11:16\nincinerated if it doesn't work out. Um,\n11:19\nit also has the most efficient value\n11:20\ntransfer. So, the dividend reduc\n11:23\nintroduces um taxes, but it doesn't\n11:27\nintroduce this with the buyback because\n11:29\nwhen shareholders decide to sell their\n11:31\nstock, that's when they're paying those\n11:33\ntaxes. So, it's up to them instead of\n11:36\njust immediately happening on the\n11:37\ndividend. we're losing a lot of money to\n11:39\nthat. Um, it manages risk, it can't fail\n11:42\nlike the research and development and\n11:45\nthe AI and VR scenario. And because\n11:47\nApple will continue to generate annual\n11:50\nrevenue, they can still invest in\n11:51\nresearch and development if that's\n11:53\nsomething they believe would be\n11:54\nbeneficial or even um put some of that\n11:58\ninto debt reduction or into special\n12:00\ndividends. It keeps the door open for a\n12:03\nlot of these, which I think is something\n12:04\nthat should be considered. Um so\n12:07\ncomparing it directly to the scenarios\n12:10\nfor the dividends IRS takes a cut which\n12:13\nleaves billions on taxes and nobody pays\n12:16\ntaxes immediately in buyback research\n12:18\nand development it's a gamble and if it\n12:20\nfails the money is gone it's the same\n12:22\nway for the AI and VR buybacks are\n12:25\nmathematically safe and regarding debt\n12:27\nApple is cheap and investors want equity\n12:30\ngrowth not safety um so for my final\n12:35\nrecommendation is to the buyback. Um,\n12:38\nreflecting on this, the most challenging\n12:40\npart of this assignment, I think, would\n12:41\nbe weighing the conflict between\n12:43\nshort-term earnings per share boost and\n12:45\nlong-term investments. I think it's\n12:47\nimportant to invest in new things, but I\n12:50\ndon't know if it's necessarily worth\n12:52\nputting all 90 billion into it. And then\n12:55\nsomething I learned from this is that\n12:56\nbuyback provides a guaranteed EPS boost\n12:59\nwhile acquisition in research and\n13:00\ndevelopment adds in a risk or a hurdle\n13:02\nrate. So for a mature company the path\n13:04\nof least resistance is going to be\n13:06\nbuyback. So again just to reiterate my\n13:08\nfinal recommendation is to approve the\n13:10\nbuyback because it balances the needs of\n13:13\nstakeholders and leaves the door open\n13:15\nfor these other scenarios just not with\n13:17\nthe pretty sizable investment of 90\n13:20\nbillion. So that was my assignment.\n13:23Thank you."
