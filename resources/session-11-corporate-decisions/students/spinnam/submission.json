  "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Fri Pinamarajio.\n0:03\nThis is my management 310 assignment\n0:05\nnumber 11 called Apple Buyback. This\n0:09\npresentation is going to analysize\n0:11\nApple's proposed 90 billion share\n0:14\npayback using the driver framework to\n0:18\nunderstand whether that buyback method\n0:22\nis going to create long-term value for\n0:26\num\n0:27\nthe firm or it transfers value between\n0:31\nstakeholders.\n0:34\nWe're going to be going through the\n0:36\ndriver stage. Start with define,\n0:37\ndiscover, represent, implement,\n0:39\nvalidate. And then we're going to do our\n0:42\nevolve and reflect. Starting with our\n0:45\ndefine and discover. The core question\n0:47\nis whether Apple's 90 billion buyback\n0:50\ncreates true long-term firm value or\n0:53\nwhether it transfers value between\n0:55\nstakeholders, managers, and bond\n0:58\nholders. So\n1:01\nwe have this capital allocation snapshot\n1:03\nand these are a couple of values that we\n1:06\nhave to keep in mind because these are\n1:09\nall things that we have to compare. So\n1:12\nwe have to compare the buyback\n1:16\nagainst the liquidity, the market\n1:19\ncontext, balance sheet, proposals and\n1:21\nalternatives. Um, we're going to be\n1:24\ncomparing the buyback specifically\n1:26\nagainst the $6 special dividend, the\n1:28\nstrategic AI VR acquisition, depth\n1:31\nreduction, and incremental R&D. And the\n1:36\nkey stakeholder in this decision are all\n1:38\nof the shareholders, institutional\n1:40\nshareholders like like Birkshshire,\n1:43\nHathway, Apple CEO and senior management\n1:46\nand employees with stock options and\n1:49\neven bond holders.\n1:51\nSo moving on\n1:54\num this is some of our available capital\n1:59\nconstraints\n2:00\nand given the financial snapshot we have\n2:05\na cash and investments of 65\n2:08\nbillion. We have a free cash flow of 100\n2:11\nbillion annually, an existing debt of\n2:14\n110 billion, shares outstanding to be\n2:17\n15.5 billion, and um a share price of\n2:22\n185 and a PE ratio\n2:26\nof 30 and a dividend yield of 0.5. So\n2:31\nsome key stakeholders that we have to\n2:34\nanalyze are retail shareholders,\n2:37\ninstitutional shareholders, management,\n2:40\nemployees and bond holders. And some of\n2:43\nour primary evaluation metrics are going\n2:45\nto be our EPS share count leverage, our\n2:48\nROIC, ownership concentration, financial\n2:51\nflexibility, agency effects, and um\n2:54\nsignaling to other markets. And some of\n2:57\nthe um core financial theories that are\n2:59\ngoing to be uh looked at is the capital\n3:02\nstructure theory, agency theory,\n3:04\nsignical signaling theory, and value\n3:06\ncreation versus value transfer and\n3:08\nstakeholder incentive alignment.\n3:13\nMoving on to our represent stage. In the\n3:17\nrepresent stage, I'm going to map out\n3:19\nhow Apple's 90 billion decision flow\n3:22\nthrough the firm. So, you're going to\n3:23\nhave um the decision. It's going to go\n3:26\nthrough the financial mechanics. It's\n3:28\ngoing to have a market response. It's\n3:29\ngoing to have a stakeholder incentives.\n3:31\nAnd then you'll see if there's going to\n3:34\nbe a long-term value. So today, Apple's\n3:37\ngoing to be starting with 165 billion in\n3:40\ncash, 110 billion in debt, and 15\n3:43\nmillion 15.5 billion shares outstanding.\n3:48\nOnce capital allocation\n3:50\nuh choice is made whether it's buyback,\n3:53\ndividend or debt reduction, R&D or\n3:56\nacquisition,\n3:58\nit's going to change the cash levels\n4:02\nand leverage and share count. So these\n4:05\nchanges affect the EPS and credit risk\n4:09\nin the short term which then is going to\n4:13\nchange the incentives for shareholders,\n4:16\nmanagement, employees, and bond holders.\n4:19\nOver the long run, these changes are\n4:22\ngoing to basically determine whether the\n4:24\ndecision creates the firm value or just\n4:27\nredistributes the value between the\n4:29\nstakeholders.\n4:31\nSo\n4:33\nwe'll be able to\n4:35\nunderstand\n4:37\num you know\n4:39\nhow each different uh choice is going to\n4:45\nchange based on if it's a short-term\n4:49\nmarket effect. So it's 0 to 12 months.\n4:52\nUsually for buyback the EPS will go up\n4:54\nand stock prices will support. Dividend\n4:57\nthere's going to be a onetime cash\n4:58\npayout. debt payout, the credit risk\n5:00\nwill go down. R&D, it's not going to\n5:03\nchange the EPS\n5:06\num immediately. Acquisition is going to\n5:09\nbe uncertainty plus it's going to have\n5:11\nanother re-evaluation. And then our\n5:14\nstakeholders are going to have different\n5:15\ntypes of shifts or incentives.\n5:19\nAnd you can see that over here looking\n5:22\nat our stakeholders return versus risk\n5:24\ntradeoff. CEO like wealth and\n5:27\ncompensation alignments. Employees are\n5:30\ngoing to try and look at their options\n5:31\nvalue and job securities and bond\n5:33\nholders are going to look for their\n5:34\ncredit safety and risk. And then the\n5:38\nlong-term impact we'd be looking at two\n5:40\nto five years. And you could see that\n5:43\nvalue creation is like R&D and suful\n5:47\nsuccessful ac acquisition. And then\n5:50\nvalue transfer has buybacks and\n5:52\ndividends. And financial stability is\n5:55\nactually going to be debt reduction.\n5:58\nAnd our capital allocation choice, we're\n6:00\ngoing to have to choose one one of the\n6:03\noptions here. So, it's going to either\n6:05\nbe a 90 billion buyback, $6 special\n6:09\ndividend, a debt reduction, an RND\n6:11\ninvestment, or strategic acquisition.\n6:16\nAll right, moving on to our another\n6:17\nrepresent slide. This table is going to\n6:19\nsummarize how each capital allocation\n6:22\noption actually affects stakeholders\n6:24\nincentives. So rather than just looking\n6:26\nat the ESP or cash flows amount, it\n6:28\nactually shows um how the same decision\n6:32\nshifts risk reward and behavior for\n6:35\nshareholders, management, employees, and\n6:37\nbond holders. And the final um column\n6:41\nactually is going to show you which\n6:42\ngroup has the strongest um incentive or\n6:45\nreason to support each option. And this\n6:48\nis important for understanding how\n6:51\nagency can conflict with governance and\n6:55\nthe pressure in real corporate finance\n6:58\ndecisions. So you can see in the buyback\n7:01\noption the ESP increases and ownership\n7:04\nincreases and for shareholders the\n7:07\nwealth increases for the CEO employees\n7:09\noptions also go up and for risk um bond\n7:14\nfor bond holders risk actually\n7:15\nincreases. So\n7:18\nshareholders and CEOs would want to do\n7:20\nthe buyback method. Dividends,\n7:23\nstakeholders would have cash payout.\n7:25\nCEOs are a little bit neutral. Employees\n7:27\nare also neutral. And um risk is still\n7:32\nhigh. So this dividend option would\n7:35\nactually be preferred by retail\n7:37\nshareholders. A debt payout, the\n7:40\nshareholders risk is down. stability\n7:44\nwould be going up for um the CEO.\n7:47\nEmployees would have a higher job\n7:49\nsecurity and bond holders are actually\n7:51\ngoing to be um safe and so the primary\n7:54\nincentive winner is probably going to be\n7:56\nbond holders. R&D the shareholders going\n8:00\nto show long-term growth. The CE is\n8:01\ngoing to pick um strategy and innovation\n8:04\nis going to be high for employees and\n8:07\nbond holders are going to be neutral. So\n8:10\nemployees are going to like this option\n8:12\nbecause of the innovation acquisition.\n8:15\nShareholders are going to have high\n8:16\nrisk. The CEO is going to have a lot of\n8:18\npower. Employees will have some growth\n8:20\nand then bond holders are going to have\n8:22\nhigh risk. So this acquisition model\n8:24\nonly looks enticing towards the CEO.\n8:28\nMoving on to our represents uh slides.\n8:32\nSo these formulas are going to be\n8:34\nshowing relationships how buybacks\n8:38\nreduce shared and increase ESP and how\n8:41\nthese changes happen with equity and\n8:44\ndebt and how ownership concentration and\n8:46\noption value are going to be affected.\n8:49\nSo in our represent we're going to go\n8:51\nthrough our shared and repurchased which\n8:54\nis going to be our buyback divided by\n8:55\nour price. Then we're going to be also\n8:57\nlooking at our new shares outstanding,\n8:59\nwhich is basically um our old shares\n9:03\nminus our shared purchase repurchased.\n9:07\nAnd then next we're going to be looking\n9:08\nat\n9:10\nthe ESP relationship\n9:13\num structure. So that's going to be our\n9:15\nnet income divided by the amount of\n9:17\nshares we have. Then we have our\n9:18\nownership concentration\n9:21\num formula and that's going to be the\n9:23\nshares held divided by total shares.\n9:27\nAnd then next we're going to be looking\n9:29\nat our cash impact.\n9:34\nSo this is going to be old cash minus\n9:36\nbuyback cash. And then we're going to be\n9:39\nlooking at our leverage direction. And\n9:41\nthat's going to be debt divided by\n9:43\nequity.\n9:46\nAnd then we're going to look at our\n9:47\nemployee option value. And that's going\n9:50\nto be our max\n9:53\nuh max multiplied by our price minus\n9:57\nlike uh strikes and then um comma zero.\n10:03\nSo we're going to see that and then\n10:05\nthese are are all of the formulas that\n10:08\nshow all the relationships about how\n10:11\nbuybacks can reduce the shares increase\n10:13\nin ESP and how changes can happen. So\n10:17\nwe're going to be doing the ESP\n10:18\nbaseline.\n10:20\num formula which is price divided by PE\n10:23\nnet income which is ESP times shares\n10:26\nshares repurchase buyback divided by\n10:28\nprice new shares which is going to be\n10:30\nold minus repurchase shares new ESP and\n10:33\nI divide by new shares um then we're\n10:36\ngoing to do dividends divide by shares\n10:39\nthen we're going to do retail payout\n10:42\ndebt after payown\n10:44\ninterest savings leverage and option\n10:46\nvalue and ownership percent Now, we're\n10:49\ngoing to be moving on to our implement\n10:51\nsection. And in this implement section,\n10:54\nI had made code that has all of the base\n10:58\ninputs of our price, our PE amount, our\n11:01\nshare outs, our cash, our debt, our\n11:03\ninterest rate, and our stakeholder\n11:05\nspecific inputs, 6% of shares, CEO\n11:09\nshareholdings, and average retail\n11:10\ninvestor holdings, and employee option\n11:13\nstrike price. Right? And then we're\n11:15\ngoing to have our baseline metrics,\n11:16\nwhich is our ESP firm price and PE, our\n11:19\nnet income implied by ESP and shares,\n11:22\nour market capitalization, our simple\n11:24\nleverage proxy, our ownership\n11:26\npercentages, and then we're going to be\n11:29\ndoing um we're going to be using all of\n11:32\nthat information and we're going to be\n11:34\nputting it through all of the different\n11:36\ntypes of scenarios. So, we're going to\n11:38\nhave it put in through the buyback\n11:39\nscenario, the dividend scenario, the\n11:42\ndebt payown scenario over here, the\n11:44\nsimple scenario. Then, we're going to\n11:46\nhave a simple scenario summary of all of\n11:49\nthe different um scenarios. So, you're\n11:52\ngoing to have your baseline state, your\n11:54\nbuyback scenario, and your dividend\n11:56\nscenario, and your debt payown scenario.\n11:58\nThis is going to be all of the summary\n11:59\nthat we have over here. Then, we're\n12:01\ngoing to have our validation checks. And\n12:03\nover here, we're going to have our\n12:04\nvalidation checks. And you can see that\n12:06\nwe have code here that's basically going\n12:09\nto um summarize\n12:13\nhow each of our values are actually\n12:16\ngoing to be true because of um\n12:22\ntheory. So\n12:26\nif for example if we see here the check\n12:31\nthe option intrinsic base is greater\n12:34\nthan or equal to zero. So employee\n12:37\noption intrinsic value is non- negative\n12:39\nat the current price. So\n12:42\nemployee option intrinsic value is non-\n12:45\nnegative at the current price. So that\n12:47\nmakes sense. It is correct. Right.\n12:50\nMoving on. Next, I'm going to basically\n12:52\ncalculate the baseline metrics\n12:55\nbefore any decision is made. So, using\n12:58\nthe price dividend by PE, I basically\n13:01\nget the implied EPS,\n13:04\nright? Then I multiply the shares to get\n13:07\nnet income. I compute Apple's market cap\n13:10\nand a simple leverage ratio using the\n13:13\ndebt divided by market cap.\n13:17\nAnd then I also compute Birkshshire's\n13:19\nand the CEO's ownership percentages and\n13:22\nthe intrinsic value of employee options\n13:24\nat the current price. This is going to\n13:27\nbasically show us the before picture so\n13:29\nwe can compare the impact of each\n13:31\nscenario.\n13:34\nNext in the buyback scenario I basically\n13:37\nallocate 90 billion to repurchase shares\n13:40\nat the current price. So the code\n13:42\ncomputes how many shares are actually\n13:44\nremoved reduced reduces the total shares\n13:47\noutstanding then computes the ESP using\n13:50\nthe same net income over smaller share\n13:52\nbase. It also updates Apple's cash\n13:55\nbalance and leverage and shows that\n13:57\nBirkshshire's and the CEO's ownership\n14:00\npercentages increase because they hold\n14:02\nthe same number of shares but there are\n14:05\nactually fewer overall shares. So this\n14:08\nis going to quantify how buybacks boost\n14:11\nESP and concentrates ownership. Next up\n14:17\nin the dividend scenario, I'm basically\n14:19\ngoing to assume that a $6 per share\n14:23\nspecial dividend. The model is going to\n14:25\ncalculate the total cash paid out and\n14:27\nthe new cash balance, but the ESP and\n14:30\nleverage stay the same because neither\n14:32\nnet income nor the share count changes.\n14:35\nSo I actually ate their payout to a\n14:38\ntypical retail investor holding a 100\n14:40\nshares to show how the decision directly\n14:43\nputs cash in their hands unlike a\n14:46\npayback.\n14:48\nIn this method, the debt payown\n14:50\nscenario, I'm going to allocate the same\n14:52\n90 billion to reduce Apple's debt. This\n14:56\nlowers interest expense. So, I calculate\n14:58\ninterest savings and then I add that\n15:01\nback to net income. Then I'm going to um\n15:04\nrecalculate the ESP and find that\n15:08\nshareholders get a good amount of bump\n15:13\nin their earnings\n15:15\nand um they also get significantly lower\n15:20\nfinancial risk because the leverage\n15:22\nratio drops. So, this scenario, the debt\n15:25\npayown scenario, really favors bond\n15:28\nholders and long-term stability rather\n15:31\nthan short ESP options.\n15:35\nMoving on, I'm going to consolidate all\n15:39\nof the scenarios into a pandas data\n15:41\nframe. So, for each the baseline, we\n15:45\nhave a baseline, a buyback, a dividend,\n15:48\nand a debt payown case. I'm going to\n15:50\nstore the ESP, the debt, cash, leverage,\n15:54\nand ownership percentages in this frame.\n15:57\nI then am going to format the results.\n16:00\nSo leverage and ownership can show as\n16:03\npercentages and ESP shows with two\n16:05\ndecimal places. This is going to um this\n16:09\nlast code line here is going to\n16:12\nsummarize is going to print out our\n16:14\nsummary table and um is what I'm going\n16:18\nto use to in the next few steps to\n16:22\nvalidate and evolve and kind of compare\n16:25\nwhich option actually improves ESPS and\n16:28\nwhich reduces risk and which\n16:30\nstakeholders actually benefit the best.\n16:35\nAll right. So over here in the implement\n16:39\nstage, I used all of those formulas to\n16:43\num made and made a working Python model.\n16:47\nAnd then\n16:49\nas you can see here, these are all of\n16:52\nour results. I started from Apple's\n16:56\nobserved price NPE back to the um\n17:00\nlooking at their baseline EPS and net\n17:02\nincome. Then I coded three main\n17:04\nscenarios. A 90 billion buyback, a $6\n17:08\nper share special dividend, and a 90\n17:11\nbillion debt payown. And then for each\n17:14\nscenario, the model recomputes the EPS,\n17:16\nthe cash, the leverage, and ownership\n17:18\nconcentration for Birkshshire and the\n17:20\nCEO. And then finally, this whole entire\n17:25\nscenario summary table are the results.\n17:28\nand you can like see and compare um all\n17:33\nof the different values and whether\n17:36\nbuyback is actually creating value or if\n17:38\nit's just transferring it between\n17:40\nstakeholders.\n17:42\nAnother thing that I wanted to talk\n17:43\nabout was our validate um slide. In the\n17:47\nvalidate stage, I basically run a lot of\n17:50\ndifferent automated checks in Python to\n17:52\nmake sure the model is actually behaving\n17:56\nconsistently with those corporate\n17:58\nfinances theories that we talked about\n18:00\nin the beginning. So the validation\n18:02\nblock basically confirms that the base\n18:05\nline ESP and PE\n18:08\nreconstruct the observed stock prices\n18:10\nand that the share counts are um like\n18:14\nnormal before and after the buyback and\n18:18\nthat the ESP rises under the buyback but\n18:21\nstays unchanged\n18:24\nlike under a dividend. It also verifies\n18:26\nthat the leverage increases after the\n18:29\nbuyback and falls after debt payown\n18:34\nand that Birkshshire's ownership and\n18:35\nconcentration rises when shares are\n18:38\nrepurchased. So all of these checks over\n18:42\nhere. So the B baseline ESP time PE\n18:47\nreconstructs the price and then the\n18:50\nshares after buyback plus shares\n18:52\nrepurchased equals original shares\n18:54\nwithin routing. So that makes sense. The\n18:56\nESP after buyback is 6.37 is higher than\n19:00\nthe baseline of 6.17.\n19:03\nESP under dividends near 6.17 equals\n19:07\nbaseline of 6.17.\n19:10\nLeverage after buyback is 3.96 is higher\n19:13\nthan the baseline of 3.84.\n19:16\nLeverage after debt payown is 0.7 is\n19:20\nlower than the baseline of 3.84\n19:23\nwhich is also okay. And then we have\n19:26\nBirkshshire ownership after buyback is\n19:28\n6.19 which is higher than the baseline\n19:31\nof 6.00\n19:33\nwhich that's also okay. And then our\n19:35\nemployee option intrinsic value is going\n19:38\nis a non- negative at the current price\n19:40\nof $15. So that also makes sense. And so\n19:44\nthese checks are going to give me\n19:45\nconfidence that the numbers that I used\n19:48\nin the of um numbers that I got from my\n19:51\nimplement section and um are going to be\n19:55\nconsistent and actually theoretically\n19:57\nsound. All right, moving on to our\n20:00\nevolve stage. These are different ways\n20:01\nthat we can actually make the project um\n20:05\nimprove or change it up a bit. So we can\n20:08\nactually change up the economic\n20:10\nenvironment and see if our results are\n20:12\ngoing to be the same. So imagine we\n20:15\nactually did a recession scenario.\n20:17\nYou're going to see that the ESP drops\n20:19\n15%. Stock price drops and we're going\n20:23\nto have to ask ourselves, is the buyback\n20:26\nmethod still smart when cash is really\n20:28\nlow? Something else that we could\n20:31\nactually look at is maybe this is going\n20:33\nto be a new environment and say we have\n20:37\na new environment of high growth and AI\n20:39\nscenarios. So apparently the ESP is\n20:42\ngoing to grow 12% and stock prices are\n20:44\ngoing to increase but we have to ask\n20:47\nourselves was spending 90 billion on\n20:49\nbuybacks a missed growth opportunity.\n20:52\nSo that could be a new environment that\n20:57\nwe could look on. um if we wanted to\n21:00\ninvolve this project. So when you do\n21:02\nlook at the model um in a recession,\n21:06\nyou're going to see that it has high\n21:08\ngrowth scenarios, but buybacks actually\n21:10\nbecome riskier during downturns. And um\n21:15\nthey're going to kind of maybe deter\n21:18\ninnovation during growth periods. And\n21:22\nyou know, was spending 90 billion on\n21:24\nbuybacks a misgrowth opportunity?\n21:26\nbuybacks\n21:28\num they kind of signal undervaluation.\n21:31\nSo\n21:33\nit shows like that the dividends have a\n21:35\nlimited growth and debt payown signals\n21:38\nlike some conservative\n21:40\num and R&D signals innovation. So that's\n21:44\ngoing to shape investor perception be\n21:46\nbeyond the raw numbers.\n21:49\nSo you'll be able to kind of see how\n21:53\neverything kind of works, right?\n21:56\nUm in the opposite area, buybacks can\n21:59\nalso increase the relative power of\n22:01\nexecutives and other investors and a\n22:06\ndebt payown can strengthen bond holders\n22:09\nand actually protect them and cause\n22:12\nfinancial stability. But if we look at\n22:15\nthis project in different um financial\n22:17\nenvironments, our results could actually\n22:19\nchange a lot. But moving on to our\n22:21\nresults. So these are our different\n22:25\nscenarios. We have the baseline,\n22:26\nbuyback, dividend and debt payown. And\n22:29\nthen we have the ESP, the depth, the\n22:31\ncash and leverage, the Bershire percent,\n22:34\nand CEO percent. So the baseline\n22:37\nanalysis shows that Apple's implied\n22:39\nearnings per share is 6.17 with a total\n22:42\nnet income of approximately 95.6\n22:45\nbillion, a market capitalization of 2.8\n22:48\n8 trillion 100 billion 110 billion in\n22:53\ndebt and 165 billion in cash. So under\n22:56\nthe 90 billion payback scenario, Apple\n22:59\nrepurchases roughly around 483 million\n23:02\nshares, reducing total shares\n23:04\noutstanding to about 15.01 billion and\n23:08\nmechanically is going to increase the\n23:10\nESP to 6.37.\n23:13\nSo while leverages rises from 3.84 84 to\n23:18\n4.01\n23:22\ncash declines to 75 billion.\n23:26\nSo the dividend scenario is assuming\n23:29\nthat a $6 per share special dividend is\n23:33\nthere and that results in immediate cash\n23:36\npayout of 93 billion and that reduces\n23:40\ncash to 72 billion but leaving the ESP\n23:43\nand leverage unchanged to 6.17 and 3.84.\n23:49\nUm, in contrast, using 90 billion to pay\n23:52\ndown debt reduces the total debt from\n23:54\n110 billion to 20 billion and it\n23:57\ngenerates approximately 4.5 billion in\n24:00\nannual interest savings while increasing\n24:02\nnet income and producing the highest EPS\n24:05\noutcome of $6.46 46\n24:10\nwhile dramatically also lowering the\n24:12\nleverage to just 0.7%.\n24:18\nAnd um that sounds pretty good. Overall,\n24:22\ntheir results are going to show that the\n24:25\nbuyback method primarily transfers value\n24:28\nto equity holders through EPS expansion\n24:31\nand ownership um concentration whereas\n24:34\nthe debt reduction\n24:37\nactually delivers both earnings um to\n24:40\nimprovement and the um financial risk\n24:44\nreduction. So in result,\n24:48\nthe ESP growth can come from financial\n24:51\num engineering and not real business\n24:53\nimprovement. Um debt reduction can\n24:56\nincrease earnings and dramatically lower\n24:59\nrisk at the same time. Dividends can\n25:02\npurely transfer value and they don't\n25:05\nimprove long-term firm performance and\n25:08\ndifferent stakeholders actually prefer\n25:11\ndifferent outcomes based on their own\n25:13\nincentives and I would say there's no\n25:16\nuniversal best capital allocation choice\n25:20\nonly um you have to look at the risks\n25:23\nand the stakeholder trade-offs to make a\n25:25\ndecision and then um one thing that I\n25:28\nlearned from this assignment is real\n25:30\ncorporate finance decisions require a\n25:32\nlot of different balancing of numbers\n25:34\nincentives and long-term strategies.\n25:38\nSo\n25:41\nwe can see that Apple's 90 back 90\n25:44\nbillion buyback boost short-term ESP\n25:46\nthrough financial engineering creating a\n25:49\nbigger portion of capital towards debt\n25:51\nreduction\n25:52\num creates superior long-term value by\n25:57\nsimultaneously improving earnings and\n25:59\nlowering their financial risk. Right?\n26:03\nBut this project showed me that a higher\n26:05\nEPS does not always mean real value\n26:08\ncreation since the buyback increases ESP\n26:12\nEPS\n26:13\nwithout improving Apple's underlying\n26:15\noperations. I learned that debt\n26:18\nreduction can be one of the only\n26:20\nstrategies that simultaneously improves\n26:22\nearnings and reduces financial risk. And\n26:25\nthen the dividends result reinforced\n26:27\nthat some financial\n26:29\num decisions are purely about\n26:31\nredistributing value, not growing it.\n26:34\nBut most importantly, I learned that\n26:36\ncapital allocation decisions are shaped\n26:39\nby looking at stakeholder incentives.\n26:42\nAnd that means there is never one\n26:44\ncorrect answer, only trade-offs that\n26:46\nmust be managed strategically.\n26:48\nBut I would say in result going back to\n26:52\nour main question which is does the 90\n26:56\nback 90 billion buyback create long-term\n26:58\nfirm value or does it mainly transfer\n27:01\nvalue between stakeholders compared to\n27:03\nalternative uses of cash.\n27:06\nUm\n27:09\nin result it says that the debt\n27:12\nreduction can be one of the only\n27:14\nstrategies that can improve earnings and\n27:17\nreduces financial risk. Right? The\n27:21\nbuyback increases EPS but it does not\n27:24\nimprove Apple's underlying operations.\n27:28Thank you for listening."
