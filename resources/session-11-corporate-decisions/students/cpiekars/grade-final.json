  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student thoroughly identifies winners and losers across shareholders, large holders, management, employees, and bondholders with concrete, scenario-tied explanations (EPS optics, option incentives, ownership changes, credit risk). They conceptually capture risk-shifting via higher leverage harming bondholders and benefiting equity, and note debt reduction as the counter-case. Evidence spans Implement and Reflect stages, showing depth beyond a surface listing.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key factors influencing optimal capital structure—cash/debt levels, leverage risk, liquidity/financial flexibility, and stakeholder impacts—and links them to outcomes. They propose a clear directional preference to moderate buybacks and maintain net cash (and consider debt reduction), supported by their analysis across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly separates value creation from value transfer, showing buybacks boost EPS without adding enterprise value and that stakeholders (bondholders) are worse off. They address opportunity cost and long-term impact by proposing R&D/M&A and debt reduction as higher-ROIC, stability-enhancing alternatives within the Evolve stage. Overall treatment is thorough across DRIVER stages and alternatives.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies that increased debt/leverage raises financial risk and distress costs. However, they never note the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield). Given the incomplete trade-off treatment, this meets a correct-but-incomplete standard, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates that leverage (via buybacks) boosts returns (EPS) and raises risk (credit risk, higher leverage), satisfying the core concept. However, they do not explicitly connect debt to fixed interest obligations as the mechanism increasing default risk, and the treatment lacks full depth. Therefore, this meets a correct but basic standard appropriate for a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes financing-driven value transfer from true value creation and notes enterprise value is largely unchanged—strong on value impact vs. transfer. However, they do not substantively discuss signaling differences among buybacks, dividends, and acquisitions on price/perception. Given this gap, the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.",
