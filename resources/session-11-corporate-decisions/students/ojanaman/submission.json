This is my\n\n2\n00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,490\nManagement 310, Session\n11, Corporate Financial\n\n3\n00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,690\nDecision Analysis\nassignment for corporate\n\n4\n00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,550\ndecisions and incentives.\nSo our assignment\n\n5\n00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,290\nhere is to evaluate\nApple's hypothetical\n\n6\n00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,930\n90 billion share\nrepurchase using the\n\n7\n00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,750\ndriver framework, where\nI'm going to be playing\n\n8\n00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,850\nthe role of an\nindependent analyst who\n\n9\n00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,150\nmust determine whether\nthe buyback of these\n\n10\n00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,850\nshares creates value\nrelative to alternative\n\n11\n00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,110\nuse cases of the cash\nthat we have to rebuy\n\n12\n00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,050\nwhile balancing\nstakeholder incentives.\n\n13\n00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,310\nSo, let's get\nstarted. Our library\n\n14\n00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,470\nis already\nimported. We have D,\n\n15\n00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,330\ndefine, and discover\nthe problem.\n\n16\n00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,950\nSo, obviously, the\ncompany we're trying to\n\n17\n00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,930\nassess is Apple. I'm\nan independent analyst.\n\n18\n00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,410\nThe decision is\ncapital allocation\n\n19\n00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,150\nstrategy with a time of\none year of execution\n\n20\n00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,230\nand five years of\npost-impact, where\n\n21\n00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,290\nthe current financial\nposition we have\n\n22\n00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,470\nis cash and investments,\n$165 billion,\n\n23\n00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,790\nannual free cash\nflow, $100 billion,\n\n24\n00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,170\ntotal debt is\n$110 billion, and\n\n25\n00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,190\nnet cash positive\nis $55 billion.\n\n26\n00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,190\nThe market context is\nthat we have a share\n\n27\n00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,890\nprice of $185 per share.\nThe price-to-earnings\n\n28\n00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,010\nratio, or P.E., is\n30. Dividend yield,\n\n29\n00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,690\n0.5%. Shares outstanding\nis $15.5 billion.\n\n30\n00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,830\nMarket capitalization\nis $2.867 billion.\n\n31\n00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,410\nAnd then the\nenterprise value of\n\n32\n00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,750\nApple itself is\n$2.9 trillion,\n\n33\n00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,900\nalmost $3 trillion.\nSo the stakeholder\n\n34\n00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,430\nownership structure\nright now of Apple is\n\n35\n00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,310\n6% to Berkshire\nHathaway. The CEO holds\n\n36\n00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,830\n$3 million in shares\nworth $551 million.\n\n37\n00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,630\nThe average retailer\ninvestor has\n\n38\n00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,170\n100 shares of flat\n-faced $18,500.\n\n39\n00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,970\nEmployee stock\noptions, the strike\n\n40\n00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,970\nprice of that is $170.\nAnd the bondholders\n\n41\n00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,570\nhave $110 billion\nof debt exposure.\n\n42\n00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,610\nSo for capital allocation\n\n43\n00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,890\noptions, we have\nmultiple options.\n\n44\n00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,130\nOption one being\nmaintaining the current\n\n45\n00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,930\nstrategy. So what\nwe're doing currently,\n\n46\n00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,690\nkeep it all the same,\nno changes at all.\n\n47\n00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,910\nOption two is a $90\nbillion share repurchase\n\n48\n00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,210\nprogram as intended\nin the problem\n\n49\n00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,930\nwith a total investment\nof $90 billion in\n\n50\n00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,020\none year's time where\neach share is $185.\n\n51\n00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,330\nSo the shares\nto repurchase\n\n52\n00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,750\nwould be 486\nmillion shares.\n\n53\n00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,050\nAnd the remaining\ncash we're going to\n\n54\n00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,390\nhave is $75 billion\nafter this purchase.\n\n55\n00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,450\nAnother option,\noption three, is $6\n\n56\n00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,990\nspecial dividend per\nshare as the total\n\n57\n00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,690\npayout of $93\nbillion for $16.5\n\n58\n00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,530\nbillion shares at $6\neach as a dividend.\n\n59\n00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,590\nOption four\nis a strategic\n\n60\n00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,270\nAI slash VR acquisition.\n\n61\n00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,210\nSo we buy a lot of\nAI and VR technology\n\n62\n00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,090\ncompanies with\nthe $90 billion\n\n63\n00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,370\nthat we have slated\non our budget.\n\n64\n00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,230\nOption five is\ndebt reduction.\n\n65\n00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,290\nSo use the $90 billion,\npay off our debt.\n\n66\n00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,910\nwe'd end up with $20\nbillion in remaining\n\n67\n00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,530\ndebt, which is pretty\ngood of an idea.\n\n68\n00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,950\nOption six is\nincremental research and\n\n69\n00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,790\ndevelopment investment.\nSo that's just another\n\n70\n00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,990\navenue where we can\ninvest our money. Our\n\n71\n00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,730\ncritical question is,\ndoes the $90 billion\n\n72\n00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,790\nbuyback create a value\nor merely just transfer\n\n73\n00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,570\nit among the stakeholders\nwho already have\n\n74\n00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,650\ntheir investments and\ntheir money into Apple\n\n75\n00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,470\nitself as a corporation?\nhow does each\n\n76\n00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,410\ncapital allocation\noption impact the key\n\n77\n00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,390\nstakeholder group what\nagency conflicts conflicts\n\n78\n00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,610\nexist between management\nincentives and\n\n79\n00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,130\nstakeholder interests\nand then what signal\n\n80\n00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,310\ndoes the buyback send\nversus alternatives given\n\n81\n00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,650\napple's current valuation\nso the alternative\n\n82\n00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,350\nof what we're supposed\nto do with our\n\n83\n00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,390\n90 billion dollars and\nthe key stakeholders\n\n84\n00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,010\nthat we're trying to\ncompare is management\n\n85\n00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,950\nagainst shareholders\nretail against institutions\n\n86\n00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,510\nequity versus debt\nshort-term and long\n\n87\n00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,150\n-term investors and\nthen the current and\n\n88\n00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,370\nfuture stakeholders so\nthat's just d defined\n\n89\n00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,510\nthat we got the context\nfor our problem of\n\n90\n00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,450\nwhat we're trying to\ndo we're trying to find\n\n91\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,450\nis taking the 90\nbillion that we have a\n\n92\n00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,470\ngood investment into\nbuying back the shares\n\n93\n00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,350\nof apple the company\nnext we have our\n\n94\n00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,990\nrepresent so in this\nstage what i've done is\n\n95\n00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,610\ntry to represent the\nstakeholder impact\n\n96\n00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,810\nframework for each of\nthe options presented\n\n97\n00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,710\nso again as we know\nwe have the current\n\n98\n00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,890\nshare price as 185\ndollars per share we have\n\n99\n00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,490\n15.5 billion shares\noutstanding that we'd\n\n100\n00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,230\nlike to rebuy with\nour 90 billion dollars\n\n101\n00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,270\nuh and then we have\nobviously our cash\n\n102\n00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,130\nposition depth income\nand the capitalization\n\n103\n00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,130\nof the market that\nwe have right now so\n\n104\n00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,310\noption one status quo\nwe stay the same the\n\n105\n00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,430\nbaseline we still have\n15.5 billion shares\n\n106\n00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,190\noutstanding our cash\nposition is still\n\n107\n00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,870\n165 billion dollars\nand our depth to equity\n\n108\n00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,430\nratio would be 3.84\npercent option two\n\n109\n00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,230\nsay we actually did\ngo ahead and buy the\n\n110\n00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,990\n90 billion dollars\nworth of shares well\n\n111\n00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,490\nwe'd repurchase 486\nmillion of shares which\n\n112\n00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,670\nis 3.1 percent of the\noutstanding meaning\n\n113\n00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,170\nour new share coin\nshare count would be\n\n114\n00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,460\nvery close to $15\nbillion, so we just cut\n\n115\n00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,550\noff around 500 million\nshares, roughly.\n\n116\n00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,550\nOur debt-to-equity\nratio increases to\n\n117\n00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,370\n3.96%, and then cash\nafter the buyback\n\n118\n00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,870\nthat we have is\n$75 billion left.\n\n119\n00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,910\nOption three, $6 of\nspecial dividends to each\n\n120\n00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,330\nshareholder, which\ngives us a payout of\n\n121\n00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,390\n93 billion it improves\nour dividend yield to\n\n122\n00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,050\n3.24 percent and uh\noption four is we just\n\n123\n00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,680\nuse the 90 billion to\npay off some our debt\n\n124\n00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,010\nwhich leaves us with\nonly 20 billion in debt\n\n125\n00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,550\nwhich is pretty good\nand gets our debt to\n\n126\n00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,030\nequity ratio down to 0\n.7 percent which seems\n\n127\n00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,870\nlike a very strong move\nuh then stakeholder\n\n128\n00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,110\nwealth impact analysis\nthat we're going to\n\n129\n00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,950\ndo uh which is basically\nall the people who\n\n130\n00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,760\nonly share in apple\nand what each um option\n\n131\n00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,170\nis going to impact\nthem in this case where\n\n132\n00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,640\nin terms of buyback\nthe ownership changes\n\n133\n00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,590\nwhere berkshire hathaway\nand the ceo um they\n\n134\n00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,250\nboth increase their\nactual ownership of shares\n\n135\n00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,670\nwith the shares that\nwe just bought back\n\n136\n00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,730\nand the monetary\nvalues of how much the\n\n137\n00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,190\nvalue is and then how much\nis the cash is received\n\n138\n00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,050\ndependent on this\nbuyback that we do and\n\n139\n00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,690\nthen the cap capital\nallocation options\n\n140\n00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,850\nthat we have are as such\nand how much each of\n\n141\n00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,950\nthese are going to\ncost depending on doing\n\n142\n00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,710\nabsolutely nothing,\nbuying back our shares,\n\n143\n00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,050\nemploying a\ndividend strategy,\n\n144\n00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,830\nor debt deduction itself.\n\n145\n00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,730\nSo obviously we have\nmany pathways to go\n\n146\n00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,390\ndown, some more beneficial\nthan others, but\n\n147\n00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,990\nwe're trying to see what\nis going to bring back\n\n148\n00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,430\nthe most amount of\nvalue, value creation,\n\n149\n00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,710\nand support our current\nand hopefully future\n\n150\n00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,970\nstakeholders so in i\nimplement we did a five\n\n151\n00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,370\nyear projection of the\ncalculations of what\n\n152\n00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,110\nhappens if we spend\nour 90 billion in each\n\n153\n00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,990\nof the options so option\none not much changes\n\n154\n00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,810\nthe shares outstanding\nare roughly going\n\n155\n00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,030\nto be the same the\nshare price is going to\n\n156\n00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,680\nincrease the cash\nposition we have increases\n\n157\n00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,030\nand as apple continues\nto grow our market\n\n158\n00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,570\ncap is going to increase\nas well not much is\n\n159\n00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,910\ngoing to change option\ntwo is we actually\n\n160\n00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,210\nbuy back the 90 billion\ndollars of shares\n\n161\n00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,970\nwhich uh just makes changes\nour shares outstanding\n\n162\n00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,210\nto 15 billion flat\nroughly and everything\n\n163\n00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,870\nelse as expected\ncontinues to increase our\n\n164\n00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,770\nshare price cash\nposition market cap all\n\n165\n00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,070\ngo up respectfully\noption three six dollars\n\n166\n00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,050\nof dividends which um\nis looking at the same\n\n167\n00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,350\ntrajectory as option\none in terms of shares\n\n168\n00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,930\noutstanding it stays\nmore or less the same\n\n169\n00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,430\ndecreases a little and\neverything increases\n\n170\n00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,110\nrespectively uh option\nfour debt reduction\n\n171\n00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,390\nso a five-year trajectory\nwould mean that\n\n172\n00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,090\num we paid down 90\nbillion we have remaining\n\n173\n00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,990\n20 billion and the\nannual interest savings\n\n174\n00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,150\nwe have is 3.6 billion\ndollars for paying\n\n175\n00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,070\non our debt with the\ninterest that we have\n\n176\n00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,690\nour debt level or our\ndebt ceiling is capped\n\n177\n00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,090\nat 20 billion our\ndebt to equity ratio\n\n178\n00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:31,050\ngoes down to 0.01 percent\nour share price as\n\n179\n00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,230\nalways continues to\ngo up but that seems\n\n180\n00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,910\nlike a very good cleaning\nof the books if you\n\n181\n00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,170\nwill in our case um\nso this uh stakeholder\n\n182\n00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,930\nwealth impact for that\nfive uh year comparison\n\n183\n00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,250\nof how much return\nthey'd be making in\n\n184\n00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,290\neach option uh\nberkshire hathaway would\n\n185\n00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,310\ncontinuously keep making\nuh roughly around 200\n\n186\n00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,590\nbillion 250 billion\nacross the five years\n\n187\n00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,310\nsame thing with uh the\nceo the ceo's shares\n\n188\n00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,670\nwould appreciate in\nvalue retail investors\n\n189\n00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,710\nwould shoot an increase\nof how much money\n\n190\n00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,910\nthey'd make employer\noptions um would rise\n\n191\n00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,910\nbut rise but they'd\nalso fluctuate a lot\n\n192\n00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,570\nbecause depending on\nthe company it could\n\n193\n00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,410\nincrease it could decrease\nit just depends on\n\n194\n00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,230\nhow the market and how\napple is performing\n\n195\n00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,510\nuh at the moment and\nthen comparing all of\n\n196\n00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,350\nthese we basically\ndetermined that at the\n\n197\n00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,310\ncurrent price earnings\nratio of 30 the buyback\n\n198\n00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,880\nearns less than\napple's um strategic\n\n199\n00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,030\ninvestments that they\nhave currently so the\n\n200\n00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,110\nbuyback actually would\ndestroy the value by\n\n201\n00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,110\ndeploying 90 billion\ndollars at 3.3 percent\n\n202\n00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,430\nof earnings yield when\nstrategic alternatives\n\n203\n00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,930\ncould earn us 15% in\nother investments.\n\n204\n00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,370\nThis value just transfers\nfrom the company\n\n205\n00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,670\nto existing shareholders,\nsubsidizing the\n\n206\n00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,050\nremaining shareholders\nas it is. So it doesn't\n\n207\n00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,930\nseem like this buyback\nis a very good decision\n\n208\n00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,870\nin our case, but we're\ngoing to check it\n\n209\n00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,330\nin V, our validation\nstep so um here we have\n\n210\n00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,790\nit uh let's see so\nhere we just have the\n\n211\n00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,510\npros and cons of each\noption staying the same\n\n212\n00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,230\nbuying back uh offering\na dividend or a debt\n\n213\n00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,470\nreduction in this case\nand we see obviously\n\n214\n00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,330\nthe pros the cons of\nmaking these decisions\n\n215\n00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,370\nbut at the end of the\nday we want to compare\n\n216\n00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,470\nthese for actual value\ncreation and value\n\n217\n00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,610\ntransfer so if we look\nat our next table here\n\n218\n00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,450\nit shows that um\nhow each thing uh is\n\n219\n00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,910\nimpacted did but the\nmost prominent thing that\n\n220\n00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,950\nactually does uh strike\nout for us is x high\n\n221\n00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,870\nfor 15 roic for gone\nnone means we could be\n\n222\n00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,790\nmaking a lot more\nmoney or at least a 15%\n\n223\n00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,070\nreturn in our other\nstrategic investments\n\n224\n00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,210\ncompared to actually\nbuying back these shares in\n\n225\n00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,610\nterms of value creation\nand value transferring\n\n226\n00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,850\nonto our current and\nfuture stakeholders\n\n227\n00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,910\nin this case, which\nit's basically the\n\n228\n00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,210\nprinciple of what we\nlearned two sessions ago in\n\n229\n00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,050\nthe lesson where we\nwant to make the most\n\n230\n00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,510\nmoney for our buck, for\nour one dollar where\n\n231\n00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,210\nyeah we could be\ninvesting in a lemon stand\n\n232\n00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,850\ntoday but we could\ninvest in um an actual\n\n233\n00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,270\nyou know tech company\nor tech startup that\n\n234\n00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,590\ncould be making us a lot\nmore money in the same\n\n235\n00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,550\namount of time so\nwhat's the best buck for\n\n236\n00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,030\nour money which shows\nin this case that uh\n\n237\n00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,890\nbuying back these shares\nis like not the most\n\n238\n00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,490\noptimal return for our\nmoney invested in it\n\n239\n00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,030\nand then uh stakeholders\nlike our winners\n\n240\n00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,710\nlosers is in this case\nit basically ends up\n\n241\n00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,300\nbeing whatever the\ncase may be is um that\n\n242\n00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,930\neveryone in this case\nis more or less either a\n\n243\n00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,950\nwinner or um neutral\nor in all cases of the\n\n244\n00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,310\nstakeholders berkshire\nceo retail investors\n\n245\n00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,710\nas like the general\npublic like or bondholders\n\n246\n00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,190\nsince whatever decision\nis made it impacts\n\n247\n00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,410\nall of them the only\nloser or neutral in\n\n248\n00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,610\nthis case would be\nthe employees who have\n\n249\n00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,470\nstock options they they\ndo not get infected\n\n250\n00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,710\naffected in any way\ninstead they just have no\n\n251\n00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,210\nchange no benefit they\njust have no impact\n\n252\n00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,050\nmiss the payout in this\ncase but yeah all this\n\n253\n00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,210\nanalysis as a whole\nshows that the buyback\n\n254\n00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,600\nof these shares for 90\nbillion dollars actually\n\n255\n00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,790\nis a very bad decision\nand it's a failure\n\n256\n00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,090\nand it has a lot of\nred flags um in the\n\n257\n00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,130\ncase where it's not\nworth the amount of money\n\n258\n00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,370\nwe're putting in for\nthis type of thing we'd\n\n259\n00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,890\nrather continue in\ngrowing and investing\n\n260\n00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,570\ninto other uh revenue\nstreams other ideas at\n\n261\n00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:45,030\napple to further um\npush the business and uh\n\n262\n00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,550\ncontinue growing the\ncompany doesn't seem\n\n263\n00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,510\nlike a good decision\num that there's a lot\n\n264\n00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,850\nof red flags even though\na lot of people are\n\n265\n00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,210\nbenefited just on a\nfinancial either because\n\n266\n00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,520\nthey're paid back\nfor the debt either\n\n267\n00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,770\nthey get paid more money\nas a result of these\n\n268\n00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,130\nshares um being bought\nback but there's\n\n269\n00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,250\nno actual real change\nor significant impact\n\n270\n00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,310\nin the growth of company\nfor us in this case\n\n271\n00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,930\nThen we move to E\nevolve, our next step.\n\n272\n00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:25,130\nHere we just run a few\nanalysis, comparisons,\n\n273\n00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,810\nand given our base\ncase, the buyback\n\n274\n00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,430\ndestroys the value given\nour PE, E value of 30.\n\n275\n00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,550\nbut what if our\nassumptions of this change\n\n276\n00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,410\nso we have these\nscenarios say at what PE\n\n277\n00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,650\nratio does our buyback\nactually create value\n\n278\n00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,810\nlike in what number\nof price earnings\n\n279\n00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,210\nratio would our buyback\nactually make sense\n\n280\n00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,270\nor be a good decision\nto go through where if\n\n281\n00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,790\nwe play with all the PE\nratios and the shares\n\n282\n00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,590\nand everything it\nshows that there is\n\n283\n00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,850\nnot really any condition\nthat um the buyback\n\n284\n00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,690\nis a good decision\nat all second we have\n\n285\n00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,970\nshare price scenarios\nso even in the uh case\n\n286\n00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,230\nwhere um we're in the\nmost optimal market\n\n287\n00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:30,170\nand we have 140 dollars\nuh what is it bear\n\n288\n00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,050\nso actually bears\nsorry Bear is the worst\n\n289\n00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,010\ncase scenario. We're\nin like $140 per share.\n\n290\n00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,010\nOur earnings yield is 4\n.4%, which is way below\n\n291\n00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,870\nour 8% cost of equity.\nSo the buyback still\n\n292\n00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,770\nremains value destructive\nand not profitable\n\n293\n00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,470\nfor Apple itself.\num scenario three\n\n294\n00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,270\nstrategic investment\nreturns which is what we've\n\n295\n00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,290\npredicted and found\nthat this is a good\n\n296\n00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,810\ninvestment where it shows\nthat over five years\n\n297\n00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,890\nthere's 75 billion in\nforegone value nearly\n\n298\n00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,630\nthe entire buyback\namount itself at the\n\n299\n00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,830\nopportunity cost if we\ndon't do this is where we\n\n300\n00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,530\nlose 15 billion per year\nin value creation if\n\n301\n00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,130\nwe don't choose this\noption because it's the\n\n302\n00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,050\nmost probable as we\nsee in like the table\n\n303\n00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,920\nwe have the check marks\nof how much money this\n\n304\n00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:30,010\nbuyback um would be\nlosing compared if we\n\n305\n00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,130\nactually just put it\ninto other investments\n\n306\n00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,470\nuh and then scenario\nfour and five is just\n\n307\n00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,190\nlike a risk and\nanalysis test that also\n\n308\n00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,610\nconclude to say that\nwe should reject the\n\n309\n00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,250\nbuyback and we'd rather\nchoose way other options\n\n310\n00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,590\nsuch as reducing\ndebt or investing in\n\n311\n00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,970\nother ventures but the\nfinal recommendation\n\n312\n00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,790\nbased off of that would\nbe if we wanted the\n\n313\n00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,790\nsafest bet we'd\nprobably choose debt\n\n314\n00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,790\nreduction and pay 90\nbillion down be left with\n\n315\n00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,550\n20 billion that would\nvery much help and\n\n316\n00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,310\nprofit our bondholders\nand the rest of our\n\n317\n00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,750\nstakeholders as a\nwhole decrease our debt\n\n318\n00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,560\nequity ratio and support\nthe company finally\n\n319\n00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,690\nin our reflection what\nexactly we learned\n\n320\n00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:25,790\nthrough this entire\nproblem I guess is that\n\n321\n00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,070\ndoes the 90 billion\ndollars create value or\n\n322\n00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,550\njust transfer it among\nthe stakeholders so\n\n323\n00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,870\nthe buyback transfers\nthe value so whatever\n\n324\n00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,290\ndecision we make it\ndoes impact all our\n\n325\n00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,570\nstakeholders but it\ndoesn't create any long\n\n326\n00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,390\n-term or short-term\nvalue for the company so\n\n327\n00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,250\nit's not very good of\na decision to make it\n\n328\n00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,210\njust impacts the the our\naccounts our financial\n\n329\n00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,250\nstatements but\ndoesn't really make a\n\n330\n00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,490\nreal impact for the\ncompany growth or for\n\n331\n00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,550\nanyone in the long run\nuh how does each capital\n\n332\n00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,150\nallocation partner\nimpact the stakeholders\n\n333\n00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,190\nso in all the cases\nas i discussed before\n\n334\n00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,530\nall the outside investors\nare winner the only\n\n335\n00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,670\npeople who end up losing\nor staying neutral\n\n336\n00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,310\nis the employees as\ntheir stock options\n\n337\n00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,730\ndon't really make such\na significant impact\n\n338\n00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,930\nthey more or less stay\nthe same if you look\n\n339\n00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,430\nat it on a numbers\nterm um what agency\n\n340\n00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,630\nconflicts exist between\nmanagement incentives and\n\n341\n00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,130\nstakeholder interests\nuh well at the end\n\n342\n00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,310\nof the day we realize\nthat the buyback of\n\n343\n00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,650\nthese shares is very\nirrational on an economic\n\n344\n00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,030\nbasis as it destroys\n10.5 billion dollars\n\n345\n00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,490\nper year even though it\nstrongly benefits like\n\n346\n00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,190\nmanagement operational\ncosts for us it\n\n347\n00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,750\ndoesn't actually progress\nand support the future\n\n348\n00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,830\nof the company and its\nprogression so it's\n\n349\n00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,150\nnot it's that great\nof a deal or impact\n\n350\n00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,550\nfor us so our at the\nend of the day looking\n\n351\n00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,950\nat all through of this\nanalysis we realized\n\n352\n00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,650\nthat yeah 90 billion\ndollars for us as apple\n\n353\n00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,770\ncan do a lot in terms\nof our separate options\n\n354\n00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,270\nof how we want to\nspend the money but the\n\n355\n00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,110\nrecommendation at\nthe end of the day if\n\n356\n00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,750\nour decision is buy back\n90 billion dollars of\n\n357\n00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,990\nshares we'd go to\nreject that decision\n\n358\n00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,950\nthat's not worth um a\ngood decision for apple\n\n359\n00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,410\njust because it doesn't\ncreate any value for\n\n360\n00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,990\nus as a company it\nonly transfers it to\n\n361\n00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,370\nshareholders well yeah\nit's a win in the short\n\n362\n00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,170\nterm but in the long\nterm it really does not\n\n363\n00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,430\ndo much so the alternative\nwould um either\n\n364\n00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,650\nbe one use the money\nto pay down the debt\n\n365\n00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,110\nget rid of our uh\nbondholders our debt holders\n\n366\n00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,330\nright now reduce our\ndebt to equity ratio\n\n367\n00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,430\nor even invest it in uh\nstrategic investments\n\n368\n00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,790\nother um ideas plans\nat apple that could\n\n369\n00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,470\nmake us more revenue\nmore money and make a\n\n370\n00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,910\nway better impact um\noverall to the company\n\n371\n00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,790\ncompared to just buying\nback shares in this\n\n372\n00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,730\ncase but yeah that's\nmy overall analysis on\n\n373\n00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,230\nthe corporate decisions\nand uh investment\n\n374\n00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,090\nincentives is problem\nfor my management 310\n\n375\n00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,450\nsession 11 assignment\ni think it's really\n\n376\n00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,890\ncool cool assignment\nto do is very heavy in\n\n377\n00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,660\nterms of like content\nfactors to think about\n\n378\n00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,010\nso i do see why you know\ncorporations do take\n\n379\n00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,270\na lot of time money\nthey consult a lot of\n\n380\n00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,810\npeople on decisions\nlike this before they\n\n381\n00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,430\nmake it because there\nis a lot of thought\n\n382\n00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,710\nprocess going behind\nit to make sure they're\n\n383\n00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,750\nmaking the right\ndecision but overall this\n\n384\n00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,930\ndid put me in that\nheadspace and i think it\n\n385\n00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,130\nwas a very cool segmentso thank you so much"
