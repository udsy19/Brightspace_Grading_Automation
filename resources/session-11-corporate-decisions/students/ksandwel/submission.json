  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Kyle Sandwell. This is\nmy corporate financial decision analysis\nfor management 310 session 11\nassignment. Today I'll be acting as an\nindependent analysis and I will evaluate\nApple's hypothetical $90 billion share\nrepurchase program using the driver\nframework.\nSo for phase one, we start we start to\nfind discover. Apple currently faces a\nhigh quality problem as an excess in\ncapital efficiency with 165 do billion\ndollars in liquidity and 100 billion in\nannual free cash flow. The company is\nsignificantly over capitalized is what\nthis means.\nThe objective for this is to determine\nthe optimal allocation for a $90 billion\ntransaction of this cash. The core\nconflict here is weighing the certainty\nof financial engineering specifically\nbuybacks against the risk and reward of\ngrowth through acquisition acquisition\nor R&D or income through divid\ndividends. To solve this, we must map\nthe stakeholder agency conflicts.\nThis conclude retail investors who are\ngenerally prefer rising share prices as\ndividends trigger immediate taxable\nevents for them. Um institutional\ninvestors like Birkshshire Hathway they\nstrongly prefer buybacks because their\npercentage ownership increases on a tax\ndeferred basis. Um management the CEO is\nincentivized by EPS targets. This means\nthat buybacks mechanically increase EPS\nwhich can trigger high higher\nperformance uh bonuses.\nAnd then employees this is critical for\nthem. There's an option option holders\nhave a strike price of $170 while the\ncurrent price is 185. So they have a $15\ndiscount compared to a non-emp employee.\nBuyback support the stock price which is\nkeeping those options in the money where\na dividend typically lowers the stock\nprice hurting employee compositions. So\na buyback supports the stock price at\n$185. But a uh dividend will lower this\nand potentially make the normal price be\nthe same price as the employees price.\nSome of our key variables for this\nanalysis are $165, $165 billion in cash,\na proposed spending of 90 billion, and a\ncurrent share of\n$185 at a PE ratio of 30 times.\nMoving to the represent phase, here's a\nthe logic map and the formulas. I\nestablished the model to model the\noutcomes. First, I established a\nbaseline derivative using the share\npricing PE ratio to find our starting\nEPS and net income, which is seen right\nhere. These are just the formulas that\nI'm going to go over.\nUm, next I modeled the buyback\nmechanics. It is important to note that\nwhen cash is spent, the company loses\nthe interest income that cash is\nearning. This is our opportunity cost.\nWe calculate the shares retired by\ndividing the budget by the share price,\nwhich you can see right here.\nUm,\nand then we adjust the net income for\nforegone interest to find the new EPS,\nwhich you can see right here. the new\nand com is divided by the current shares\nin shared retired. Finally, I modeled an\nacquisition alternative. Instead of\nbuying stock, we model buying a company\nwith an assumed 10% return on invested\ncapital or ROIC\nto see if growth outweighs financial\nengineering.\nThen move down to the implement and I\ndid code I did have a Python code for\nthis which I'll show you in a second.\nBut in the implement phase, I execute\nthese calculations. We'll have the\nPython model available. I'm going walk\nyou through this step, this specific\nmath here. So, you can see the baseline\nuh based on the inputs, our EPS, current\nEPS is $6.17.\nThis gives us a baseline net income of\n95.64\nbillion.\nAnd then in the buyback scenario, if we\ndeploy the $90 billion into buybacks, we\nretire 486 billion shares. However, we\nincur a cost. We lose the interest on\nthat cash, which amounts to $2.84 84\nbillion after tax. This drops our net\nincome just to 92.80 billion,\nwhich is down roughly 3 billion from the\nold net income.\nBut because the share count drops in to\n15.014 billion, our new EPS rises to\n$6.18.\nSo while the net income goes down, the\nEPS is going up for this one. And then\nthe acquisition scenario comparatively\nif we spent that 90 billion on a high\ngrowth acquisition yielding 10% we\ngenerate $7.11 billion in new profit.\nThis drives net income up to 99.91\nbillion and it keeping the shares the\nshare count constant. The new EPS would\nbe $645%.\nOr $645 sorry. So it's kind of an\nobvious choice\nI think. Move on over here. This is the\nPython code that Gemini gave me. You can\njust see the baseline net income and the\nEPS, the buyback scenario, shares\nretired in the new EPS, then the new EPS\nfor the acquisition scenario. It rounded\na little bit different, but if you\nexpanded this, it would round out to\n6.45.\nThen down to validate. Um, we validate\nwe validate these results through a\nvaluation versus transfer analysis. We\nmust ask ourselves, are we creating\nvalue or just moving money around? For\nthe value creation only occurs if the\nstock is undervalued. For example, if we\nbuy back stock at $185, but the\nintrinsic value is actually $200, we\nrepresent genuine value creation for\nmany shareholders like Birkshshire\nHathway.\nHowever, if the stock is overvalued, the\nbuyback destroys value. It becomes a\nvalue transfer, effectively moving\nwealth from one company to the\nshareholders who are selling at the high\nprice. Value transfer is not usually the\nbest option.\nTo ensure robustness,\nto ensure robustness, we evolve the\nmodel by looking at the risk. First, the\nrecession risk. If the share price drops\nto $150, the buyback actually becomes\nmore effective because that same $90\nbillion retires a larger number of\nshares.\nSecond is innovation risk or opportunity\ncost. The biggest risk here isn't\nfinancial but strategic. If Apple spends\n$90 billion on buybacks and misses the\nnext major AI shift, the safety of the\nbuyback becomes a liability because that\nliquidity is gone. So, it's more risky,\nbut it could be more it could be a\nbetter option, but it has a lot more\nrisk than the recession.\nFinally, um I want to reflect on and\noffer my recommendation. I recommend\nproceeding with the $90 billion share\nrepurchase program executed over 12\nmonths.\nUm, I justify this in a three-fold\nmodel. The risk profile, while the\nacquisition scenario yields a higher EPS\nat $645 compared to $68, the integration\nrisk of a $90 billion merger is extreme.\nThe buyback provides a risk-free Florida\nEPS. So, the buyback essentially has no\nrisk compared to the uh merger, which is\na very very expensive and high risk.\nSecond, the stakeholder alignment. Um\nthis decision satisfies institutional\ninvestors via tax efficiency and\nsupports the stock price for employee\noptions. And finally the capital\ndiscipline. Um this signals maturity and\nprevents management from empire building\nreturning excess cash to owners rather\nthan wasting on low return projects.\nThis is just making sure the money that\nwe make is going to the right things and\nnot just being wasted.\nSo I can come over here. I'll show you\nmy Gemini real quick. I asked it a few\nprompts. It helped me develop this. It\ngave me the code.\nIt just helped me really organize my\nthoughts.\nAnd yeah, it asked for the formulas\nbecause they're pro provided. I like\nseeing the formulas in front of me. So,\njust in code so I can make sense of what\nI'm seeing.\nAnd yeah, that is my video. Thank youfor your time."
