  "transcript": "Hello everybody. My name is Shane\nSchuman and today we're going to be um\nevaluating a proposal for Apple uh in\nthis question to execute a $90 billion\nshare purchase program. Um to ensure\nthis recommendation is obviously\nobjective and mathematically sound, we\nhave to use the driver framework. Um\nwe've obviously gone through all the\nframeworks here for define and discover\nto represent and validate\nor implement, validate, evolve and\nreflect. So, first we're going to go\nthrough the problem we have here. As you\nsee, we have uh 165 billion in cash\ninvestments 100 billion for uh free cash\nflow. For liquidity, we have our market\ncontext, $185 share.\nWe have our dividend yield.5%.\n5.5 billion shares outstanding. We have\na balance sheet or proposing alternative\nspecial dividend strategic AI/VR\nacquisition\nand to go through some driver framework\nwe have here\num we're going to be defining the\ntension which is Apple's obviously\nsitting on excess liquidity with $100\nbillion in annual free cash flow. The\nmarket is trading them at premium 30\ntimes earnings.\nSo, the question we're going to be\nlooking at here is does buying back the\nstock at all-time high create value or\nis it just moving wealth over? That's\nthe big thing.\nSo,\nto be going through a lot of this, we\nobviously have our representation and\nour implementation\nwhich is obviously through all of this.\nWe have some plans here, but a lot of\nour Python will be\num which was used through the KISS\nmethod, keep it simple, stupid.\nUm we have our model here to test the\nthe distinct capital allocation\nscenarios and the status quo.\nUm we have the buyback.\nLet's just move over here.\nLet me run it quickly.\nmight take a second.\nSome things we have to go through here.\nWe have the buyback which is when we\nretire shares at the current price of\n185.\nWe have our special dividend right here\nwhich is to flush the cash directly to\nstare the shareholders. We have a\nstrategic acquisition which is obviously\nmodeled at 10% ROIC\nand then it's obviously representing a\nhigh riskreward AI investment and we\nhave scenario E which is the debt\nreduction repaying 4% debt to delever\nthe balance sheet\ngoing through all of that we also have\nto validate some of this stuff going\nthrough some of the outputs\nlater down this table\nwe have um the validation of our\nhypothesis. As we can see in the um\nscroll down here really quickly\nas we can see in a lot of our questions\nand answers here.\nUh we have\num the buyback scenario which is a\nscenario B\nwhich is driving our EPS from roughly\n$6.17\nto $6.36\nwhich\nis a incremental jump of about 3.2%.\nWhich is obviously pretty good. We have\nour we have our scenario E which is only\nabout 4% which is about 4%.\nWhich means that paying it off barely\nmoves the needle on earnings. So it's a\ninefficient use of capital.\nWe also have the special dividend right\nover here which delivers immediate cash\nbut but leaves EPS flat which we see\nright there. So mathematically the\nbuyback does work if you believe the\nstock price will sustain its value but\nthe math isn't just all the things to\nlook at here going to evolve everything.\nLet's go through some of this stuff. We\nhave some more stuff to show.\nWe have to look at agency cost and\nincentives\nwhich can be kind of seen through all\nthese numbers.\nBut first, we're going to look at the\ninstitutional ownership like Birchshire\nHathaway\nand um the stakes ownership state\npassively increasing from 6% to 6.2%\nwithout them spending a dime.\nWe have some visual representation down\nhere.\nRight here we have some represent\nrepresentation but through the\nmanagement We have three million shares\nin an option of $170 strike. Obviously,\nmanagement is incentivized to choose the\nbuyback, but why? Because it supports\nthe stock price\nand obviously it boosts EPS.\nSo, without the execution risk of a\nmassive acquisition,\nthis is a classic agency conflict is\nwhat we're going to be going through,\nwhich we'll see through some of these.\nAnd then for the last part, we're going\nto have to reflect, which is going\nthrough some of our recommendations\nfor what to do.\nThe big re the big recommendation\nobviously is the $90 million buyback,\nbut we do have caveats.\nUm so the rationale that I've uh reached\nis obviously we have tax efficiency\nwhich is a 5.81 dividend creates an\nimmediate tax liability. We have\nsignaling which is it signals confidence\nin Apple's recurring the cash flow\nstability. We have our we also have the\nvaluation support for the P for E or\nPE30 is high which is reducing share\ncount by 3% and also we have strategic\nflexibility like unlike M&A we have um\nan execution risk or a dividend but we\ndo have some cautions the caveat here\nwhich is obviously the value transfer\nwhich is at 30x you're buying $1 of\nearning for $30. So if the earnings slow\nit'll destroy the value and then also\nour innovation lag which is for R&D not\nbeing starved\num hoping that Apple will generate\nenough\nFCF to do both.\nSo going through all this obviously we\nhave some\nuh we have some graphs here to visually\nrepresent everything we're we're saying\nwe have our status quo and the post\nbuyback which as we can see is the the\nbiggest increment we have our\nacquisition the buybacks we can see the\ndifference in pricing between all of\nthem especially on EPS\num and then back here we'll have some\nmore explanations here\nthrough\nthings like the EPS impact act being an\nincrease of about 19 cents which is a\nfinancial engineering and then we'll\nalso have some ownership dynamics with\nBerkshire Hathaway increasing from 6% to\n6.19%.\nSo\nobviously going through a lot of this we\ncan see that the $90 million buyback is\nthe best option\nbecause of um all the rationale we just\nwent over including you know the tax\nfish to the signaling\nand the um strategic flexibility and\nevaluation which is obviously seen here\nin our Python output compared to the\nother options\nand all the graphs. that we went through\nfor quantitatively and analy and through\nanalyzation financially we can see that\num the $90 million buyback is obviously\nthe best option back to the requirements\nthough so we'll go through some of these\nother things using the driving method I\nthought that the ability to visualize\nall of this\nstuff was really really cool obviously\nwe can see all the graphs here comparing\nour earnings per share status quo\nbuyback\nWe have a special dividend we\nacquisition and we have the debt payback\nwhich from there tells a different story\nthan what we actually know. We were post\nbuyback being such an increase.\nSo from all that we can come to the\nconclusion that the $90 million buyback\nis the best option to answer all\nquestions and satisfy\nall. Thank you.\n\nAll\n\nFor you\nRecently uploaded"
