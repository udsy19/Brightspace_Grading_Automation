  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses key capital structure factors—cash, debt, leverage, financial flexibility—and explains mechanisms (interest savings, EPS effects) influencing the choice. They propose a clear direction (balanced approach with debt reduction) supported by these factors, and the DRIVER stages show iterative validation and refinement toward optimal capital structure reasoning.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly distinguishes value creation from value transfer across alternatives (e.g., buybacks vs. ROIC-driven investments) and discusses stakeholder redistribution and balance-sheet effects. They also address opportunity cost and long-term strategy via ROIC sensitivities and a balanced capital allocation. Multiple options are evaluated with specific outcomes, satisfying a thorough, conceptually strong treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly covered shareholders (including types), management (execution risk), and bondholders, and briefly noted employees with options. They connected scenarios to stakeholder impacts (e.g., dividends for shareholders, debt reduction helping bondholders), satisfying completeness at an introductory level with sufficient depth for a PASS in this moderate category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified the risk side of capital structure (leverage and balance sheet strength) but did not address the tax benefit of debt (interest tax shield). Coverage is conceptually correct yet incomplete for the full trade-off, warranting a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies stakeholder groups and provides some gain/loss insights (e.g., dividends vs. bondholders; debt reduction helping bondholders; leverage added by buybacks). However, they do not analyze employees with options, large holders, or management incentives in depth, and they omit asset substitution/risk-shifting dynamics tied to leverage and buybacks. Coverage is conceptually sound but incomplete, fitting a Partial.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a correct conceptual link between financing choices and returns (EPS effects) and notes leverage implications and balance sheet strength. However, they do not explicitly explain that leverage amplifies both returns and risks nor state that debt’s fixed interest raises default risk. The treatment is correct but basic, fitting a PARTIAL under the moderate standard.",
