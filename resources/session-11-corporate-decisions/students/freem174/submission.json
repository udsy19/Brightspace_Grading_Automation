  "transcript": "0:02\nHello there. In this video, I'm using\n0:04\nthe driver framework to analyze Apple's\n0:06\nproposed 90 billion share buyback using\n0:09\nthe Python model. Driver works like a\n0:12\nGPS for financial problem solving. And\n0:14\nI'll walk through each step as I build\n0:16\nand evaluate the scenarios. D. Define\n0:18\nand discover. In the define and discover\n0:20\nstage, I'm setting my destination just\n0:23\nlike entering an address into a GPS. My\n0:26\ngoal is to decide whether Apple should\n0:28\nspend 90 billion on share repurchases or\n0:31\nwhether alternative uses of that cash\n0:33\nsuch as dividend, paying down debt,\n0:35\nmaking an AI VR acquisition or\n0:38\nincreasing R&D and creating more\n0:40\nlong-term value. I collected all the key\n0:42\nfacts from the assignment. 165 billion\n0:45\nin cash and investments. 100 billion\n0:48\nannual cash flow.\n0:50\nStock price 185 PE30\n0:55\num 15.5 billion shares outstanding 110\n0:59\nbillion in debt stakeholders include\n1:01\nBirkshshire Hathway with 6% the CEO with\n1:05\n3 million shares retail investors with\n1:07\nabout 100 shares each employees with\n1:10\noptions at $170 with and bond holders.\n1:14\nThis sets up our problem. What is the b\n1:16\nthe best financial route for Apple to\n1:18\ntake with the $90 billion?\n1:21\nMy objectives are to maximize long-term\n1:23\nper share value, not shortterm EPS\n1:26\ntricks. Maintain a strong financial\n1:29\nflexible balance sheet. Understand how\n1:31\neach option affects shareholders,\n1:33\nemployees, and bond holders. Identify\n1:35\nwhether the buyback creates real value\n1:37\nor just transfers it.\n1:41\nSo, this stage is how I know where I'm\n1:43\ngoing and why. The next is R, which is\n1:46\nrepresent.\n1:48\nThis is like the GPS showing the route\n1:49\nbefore I start driving. Here's the plan\n1:51\nfor my analysis. Build a Python model\n1:53\nthat computes key metrics for each\n1:55\nscenario. Net income, net out, shares,\n1:58\noutstanding, EPS, cash, net depth,\n2:01\ndebt,\n2:03\nEPS change base case. Use a data frame\n2:08\nto make comparisons easy. Generate a bar\n2:11\nchart that usually visually shows which\n2:13\noption creates the most EPS.\n2:16\nThen interpret the results from a\n2:17\nstrategic stakeholder point of view.\n2:19\nThis gives me a clear road map before I\n2:21\nstart coding.\n2:23\nI implement. Now I'm in the implement\n2:25\nstage. This is where I start driving and\n2:27\nfollow the route by running the Python\n2:29\ncode. So here is the full code that I\n2:31\nuse. I can you can see here and I have\n2:34\nall those numbers and everything I\n2:35\ntalked about earlier listed out.\n2:38\nAnd as we go back here\n2:41\nall the way down, you can see this is\n2:43\nthe information we get back. The base\n2:46\nback everything um as well as our visual\n2:49\nhere.\n2:50\nMe smaller so it's easier to see.\n2:55\nWhoops.\n2:57\nAll right. But there is the code for the\n3:00\nimplement stage.\n3:02\nSo when I run the code, here's what I\n3:04\nfind. hit the buyback as you can see\n3:07\nthere slightly from 6.17\n3:10\nto 6.21\n3:14\num special dividends EPS falls to 6.01\n3:17\nshareholders get cash now but it weakens\n3:19\nApple's balance sheet debt reduction EPS\n3:22\nrises to 6.36 Apple also strengthens its\n3:25\nfinancial position which helps bond\n3:27\nholders AIVR acquisition EPS rises the\n3:31\nmost 6.6 six. But this depends on\n3:34\nmanagement ex executing well at 10% ROIC\n3:38\nR&D EPS falls shortterm but it supports\n3:40\nApple's long-term innovation and\n3:42\ncompetitiveness. These results clearly\n3:44\nin the EPS bar chart. These appear\n3:47\nclearly in the EPS bar chart which was\n3:49\nproduced by the code. B is for validate.\n3:53\nIn the validate in the validate stage I\n3:56\nchecked that the model made sense. EPS\n3:58\nformulas were correct. Buyback increase\n4:00\nEPS mainly by shrinking shares, not by\n4:03\nimproving profit. Debt repayment\n4:05\nincreases EPS by saving interest.\n4:07\nAcquisition results depends heavily on\n4:09\nROIC assumption. R&D has a long-term\n4:12\nbenefit that doesn't show up in\n4:14\nshort-term EPS. I also tested different\n4:17\nvalues for ROIC and interest rates to\n4:19\nensure the model responded logically. E\n4:22\nis for evolve. In the evolve stage, I\n4:24\nimproved the final answer. Originally, I\n4:26\nthought the buyback might be the best\n4:27\noption because EPS went up. But once I\n4:31\nsaw how much leverage it added and how\n4:33\nstrong the acquisition and debt\n4:34\nrepayment results were, it became clear\n4:36\nthat a pure 90 billion buyback wasn't\n4:39\nthe best overall route. So, I evolved\n4:41\nthe plan into a balanced capital\n4:43\nallocation strategy.\n4:45\nReflect. Finally, in the reflect stage,\n4:48\nI summarized my recommendation and what\n4:50\nI learned. The final recommendation, a\n4:52\nmixed approach is best. 40 billion in\n4:55\nbuybacks to signal confidence, 30\n4:57\nbillion towards AIVR and R&D to support\n5:00\nlong-term value and 20 billion in debt\n5:03\nreduction to protect the balance sheet.\n5:06\nWhat I learned using Driver felt like a\n5:09\nGPS. Define and discover, set the\n5:11\ndestination, represent, see the route,\n5:14\nimplement, start driving, validate,\n5:16\nconfirm you're on track, evolve,\n5:19\nupdate to a better route, reflect, save\n5:21\nthe route for next time. This process\n5:22\nhelped me move from memorizing finance\n5:24\nconcepts to actually building and\n5:26\nexplaining a full capital allocation\n5:28\nanalysis.\n5:30\nThank you."
