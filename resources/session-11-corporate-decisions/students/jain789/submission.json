This is session 11\n0:03\nassignment and in this assignment we're\n0:06\ngoing to evaluate a $90 billion share\n0:08\nrepurchase plan against key capital\n0:10\nallocation alternatives which are\n0:12\nspecial dividend accusation debt\n0:14\nreduction R&D for the company Apple\n0:17\nwhile focusing on value creation\n0:19\nstockholder impact and agency\n0:20\nconsiderations. From this assignment, we\n0:23\nhave key financial market data such as\n0:25\nthe cash liquidity which is 165 billion.\n0:28\nAnnual FCF FCF 100 billion. We have the\n0:32\nratios and all that etc. As you can see\n0:34\ndown this list. So what we're going to\n0:37\ndo is we're going to map out the\n0:39\nanalytical approach. We're going to\n0:40\nexecute certain plans. We're going to\n0:41\ncheck results, discuss the broader\n0:44\nimplications and then give our\n0:45\nrecommendation. So the plan the buyback\n0:48\nimpact we're going to calculate\n0:50\nimmediate effect on shares outstanding\n0:52\nwe're going to calculate uh the impact\n0:54\nof special dividends debt reduction\n0:57\naccusations and R&D we're going to\n0:59\nquantify outcomes for shareholders we're\n1:01\ngoing to see value versus value creation\n1:02\nversus value transfer and agency and\n1:05\nsignaling so key metrics for comparison\n1:07\nwe're going to use earnings per share\n1:09\nformula which is net income divided by\n1:11\nshares outstanding ROI capital which is\n1:14\nnet profit after tax divided by\n1:16\ninvestment invested capital leverage u\n1:20\nwhich we know and from here now what\n1:22\nwe're going to do is we're going to take\n1:24\nour script and send it to collab we're\n1:27\ngoing to run our script to make sure it\n1:28\nworks as you can see here we're going to\n1:30\ncalculate buyback metrics we're going to\n1:32\nsee our formulas and from here we can\n1:35\nsee our u results where we have shares\n1:39\nof over 480 um million share reduction\n1:43\nis about 3.14% of shares\n1:45\nInitial EPS is $6.17.\n1:49\nNew EPS is $6.37. EPS exertion is $3.24.\n1:53\nAnd from the stakeholder ownership\n1:55\nchange, we can see Burke Shire Hathway\n1:57\ngo from 6 to 6.2%\n2:00\nand management CEO from about\n2:03\n0194 to 02.\n2:06\nNow, let's go back and we're going to\n2:09\nuse comparisons for alternatives. For\n2:11\nbuyback, we can do an alternative of 90\n2:14\nbillion per share, special dividend of\n2:16\n$6 accusations, debt reductions. And for\n2:20\ndebt reduction, EPS net income due to\n2:22\nlower interest expense making EPS\n2:24\nslightly debt reduction. We're going to\n2:27\nsee stakeholder impact summary where we\n2:30\ncan see the buyback impact for retail\n2:32\nshareholder is positive and\n2:34\ninstitutional holders for Birkshshire\n2:36\npositive. management co with three\n2:39\nmillion shares is very positive.\n2:40\nEmployees with 170 strike options is\n2:44\npositive. However, on the other hand,\n2:46\nbond holders is negative. Now, let's go\n2:49\non to our validation where we're going\n2:50\nto see value creation versus value\n2:52\ntransfer. Value creation occurs when a\n2:54\nbuyback is executed at a price below the\n2:56\nintrinsic value. Apple's PE of 30\n2:59\nsuggests the market views it as a high\n3:01\ngrowth company, so that the stock may be\n3:04\novervalued or fairly valued. If it's\n3:06\novervalued, the buyback is value\n3:08\ndestruction. However, on value transfer\n3:10\nthat primarily acts as value transfer\n3:12\nmechanism. It transfers cash for the\n3:14\ncompany balance sheet through the\n3:16\nsharing to selling shareholders. It\n3:19\ntransfers value from bond holders to\n3:22\nremaining shareholders as well as an\n3:24\noutside benefit to the management often\n3:26\nat the expense of long-term investment.\n3:28\nFrom this, we can conclude that the high\n3:30\nPE of 30, the buyback is more likely a\n3:32\nvalue transfer.\n3:35\nNow signaling effects in capital\n3:37\ndiscipline. We can see that buyback\n3:39\nsignals management believes the stock is\n3:42\na reasonable investment. Risk signals a\n3:44\nlack of value strategic investment\n3:47\nopportunities. Special dividends\n3:50\nimmediate return of shareholders.\n3:52\nAccusation strong signals strategic\n3:54\nlong-term focus. Debt reduction signals\n3:56\nprudence and financial convertism.\n3:59\nIncremental R&D signals confidence and\n4:02\ninternal organic growth. Now let's talk\n4:05\nabout the $90 million buyback. It's a\n4:07\nvery defensive financially driven thing\n4:10\nwhere Apple size liquidity of 165\n4:13\nbillion FCF of 100 billion. The optimal\n4:16\ncapital structure should balance\n4:17\nfinancial efficiency with strategic\n4:19\noptionility.\n4:22\nAgency consideration\n4:24\nuh the high immediate benefit to\n4:25\nmanagement creates a agency problem.\n4:27\nHowever, from this we should propose a\n4:29\nhybrid solution where we can balance all\n4:32\nof our things where we can have\n4:33\nstrategic acquisition of 50 billion to\n4:36\naddress strategic AI divided by VR which\n4:39\nis a long-term value creation\n4:40\nincremental R&D of 10 billion to support\n4:43\norganic growth shareholder repurchase of\n4:46\n30 billion to maintain dividend buyback\n4:48\npolicy and this way we have our total\n4:51\nallocation of 90 billion where our\n4:53\nbalance sheet remains strong but we're\n4:55\ngoing from 165 billion to 75 billion.\n4:57\nmillion. Through this hybrid model, we\n5:00\ncan see it addresses agency risk by\n5:02\nprioritizing strategic investment over\n5:04\npure financial engineering or RO ROIC\n5:08\nstrategic fit is much better by\n5:11\ninvesting in high growth areas. And by\n5:13\nallocating 30 billion to buybacks, we\n5:15\nmaintain shareholder returns. Now the 90\n5:18\nbillion share repurchase while excertive\n5:22\nto EPS immediately beneficial to\n5:24\nstakeholders is likely a value transfer\n5:26\nwhich we talked about before due to a\n5:28\nhigh PE ratio of 30. The biggest risk is\n5:31\nthe agency problem um due to the\n5:33\nprioritation of short-term EPS and value\n5:36\ncreation strategic growth. So from this\n5:38\nwe can see um all of our um calculations\n5:41\nand analytical data and from there I\n5:44\nwould strongly suggest to not approve\n5:46\nthe full $90 billion buyback. Instead go\n5:49\nthrough the go for a hybrid capital\n5:51\nallocation strategy what we talked about\n5:53\nwhich would address the long-term\n5:55\ncompetitive landscape. Even better,\n5:57\nallocate 50 billion to strategic AI\n6:00\naccusation to secure next generation of\n6:02\ngrowth, the 10 billion incremental R&D\n6:05\nuh and then the 30 billion to allocate\n6:07\nthe residual share repurchase program to\n6:10\nmaintain capital discipline and return\n6:12\nresidual cash to shareholders. This\n6:15\nstrategy would end up maximizing value\n6:17\ncreation, minimizing agency risk and\n6:19\nsend strong signal of commitment to both\n6:20\ninnovation and shareholders return. And\n6:23\nyeah, that is my final recommendation.\n6:25Thank you so much for listening."
