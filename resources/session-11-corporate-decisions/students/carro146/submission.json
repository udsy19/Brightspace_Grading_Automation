  "transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Abby and in this presentation I'm acting as an independent financial analyst evaluating Apple's proposed $90 billion share repurchase program. So I'm going to walk through the analysis using the driver framework which structures the workflow across define, discover, represent, implement, validate, evolve, and reflect. So, the question I'm ultimately answering is, does a $90 billion um dollar buy pack create more value for shareholders and stakeholders than other possible uses of cash, including a special dividend, a strategic AI/VR acquisition, debt reduction, or incremental R&D. And beyond the numbers, I'll h I'll highlight the stakeholder impacts, agency incentives, signaling effects, and whether each option creates value or simply transfers it. So I'll start with the defined stage. So in the define stage, um I identified this the decision, the objectives, and the stakeholders. So, the decision is whether Apple should proceed with a $90 billion buyback or reallocate the that capital to a dividend, investment, debt reduction, or R&D. The primary objective is maximizing long-term shareholder value. And then secondary objectives. There we go. Secondary objectives include maintaining a prudent capital structure, aligning with stakeholder incentives, preserving a strategic flexibility for future innovation, and sending a credible signal to markets regarding Apple's capital allocation discipline. And then stakeholders affected by this decision include retailer shareholders, institutional investors including Birkshshire Holloway, Hathaway, management and employees with stock or options, bond holders and the market which interprets capital allocation choices as signals or valuation of valuation and opportunity. So these priorities drive the entire analysis. So moving into the discover stage, I collected the key financial inputs from the stage or from the case. So Apple share price is 185. PE is 30 shares outstanding. Shares outstanding or 15.5 billion. Cash and investments total $165 billion and Apple generates around hundred billion in annual free cash flow. The company also has $110 billion in total debt. So using price divided by PE I calculated baseline um baseline EPS of $6.17 which implies net income of about $96 billion. I also documented the assumptions that the drive model is a 21% tax rate, 4% interest rate on debt, 12% ROIC assumption for potential acquisition, 5% baseline EPS growth, and for R&D, I modeled the effect of expensing the investment in year one and increasing long-term growth. I then grounded the analysis in several key theories. Capital structure theory, especially the brand, the trade-off between tax shield benefits and financial risk. Agency theory, recognizing that the management and employees have often have equity linked incentives that can bias the decision. Three, signaling theory, where capital allocation choices communicate managers expectations about future performances. and four the out or the value creation versus value transfer acknowledging that buyback only create value when executed below intrinsic value. So with the inputs and the theory established I moved into represent. So in the represent stage I mapped out the entire model before writing any code. So the model includes five major components. One inputs and assumptions. Two baseline metrics. Three, a scenario engine modeling five capital allocation alternatives. Four, the stakeholder outcomes. And five, visual visualizations in sensitivity analysis. So for every scenario, the model calculates cash debt and share count, net income, EPS, and implied share price, leverage, ownership concentration, retail shareholder wealth, and employee option value. So this blueprint made the implementation clean, consistent, and transparent. So next, so here you can see the Well, when we get there. There we go. There we go. So here you can see the core scenario comparison and then I'll walk through what each option does to EPS, share price, leverage, and stakeholders. So for baseline, the EPS is $6.17, implied price is $185, and leverage is extremely low at 3.7%. Showing a conservative balance sheet. Retail investors holding 100 shares have $18,500 in equity, and the employee options have $15 of intrinsic value. So for the so a 90 billion buyback repurchases about um49 billion shares reducing the share count to 15.01 billion and then EPS increases to 6.37 and the implied share price rises to $191. So retail investors equity increases to around $19,100. Birkshshire's ownership rises from 6% to 6.19% and employee options gain more value. So a $21 intrinsic value. So the leverage day is basically the same because the buyback is funded from cash. Okay. So the $6 dividend costs around $93 billion and then EPS stays flat at 6.17 and the ownership percentages do not change. So retail investors receive $600 in cash. Um $600 in cash representing similar total value to buy back but without in increasing ownership concentration or EPS\n\num\n\nwhere is it? Okay.\n\nSo, assuming Apple Wait, yeah, assuming Apple earns 12% ROIC at a $90 billion acquisition.\n\nWait, I think this is wrong.\n\nWhere is it? Sorry, guys.\n\nOkay, I've got it now. We're still right here. Um, so, okay. Yes, for the dividend scenario. So, cash transfer without structural changes. The $6 dividend costs around $93 billion and the EPS stays flat at about 6.17 and the ownership percentages do not change. Like I said before, retail investors receive $600 in cash representing similar total value to the buyback but without increasing ownership concentration or EPS. Okay. Now for the acquisition scenario, which is number three on here. So assuming Apple earns 12% ROIC on a $90 billion acquisition after tax incremental net income is about $8.5 billion. So EPS increases to 6.72, the highest among all scenarios, and the implied price increases to $21.50. So employee option value increases substantially. Leverage also decreases slightly because equity value rises. And then this scenario offers the strongest value creation, but also has the highest execution risk. The um and then for number four, debt reduction. So using $90 billion to repay debt reduces total debt from 110 billion to 20 billion, dropping leverage from seven from 3.7% to under 1%. The safest capital structure by far after tax interest savings rise raise EPS to 6.35 similar to the buyback. Retail wealth increases moderately and bond holders benefit significantly. And then number five, R&D. So expensing $90 billion of R&D drops reported EPS to 0.36 and the implied price falls accordingly. This scenario illustrates the classic tension between short-term reporting pressure and long-term innovation payoff. So it's not meant to represent permanent valuation but to highlight how according or how accounting treatment changes short-term metrics. So now I validated the model by confirming that baseline EPS matches the derived EPS. the buyback share count matches the expected repurchase amount and that all scenarios maintain non- negative cash. So this confirms the internal consistency of the scenario engine.\n\nUm so in the evolve stage I added tools to explore how changes affect outcomes. So first I created a scenario toggle which lets the user click and inspect detailed metrics for any single scenario. right here.\n\nAnd then second, I added a buyback sensitivity analysis. So as the buyback ranges from 30 billion to 120 billion, EPS increases from 6.23 to 6.44, but the gains flatten out. So this shows that while buybacks do increase EPS EPS, the marginal benefit diminishes, which matters for deciding the optimal size of the program.\n\nSo this bar chart compares EPS across scenarios. So you can clearly see that dividend is EPS neutral. Buyback and debt reduction offer modest EPS improvements. Acquisition meaningfully increases EPS and R&D depresses EPS in short term. So this makes the trade-offs intuitive.\n\nSo this chart compares the leverage ratios. So debt reduction produces the safest balance sheet. Acquisition also reduces leverage slightly. Buyback and dividend maintain the status quo and R&D snapshot temporarily increases leverage due to reduced equity value. Right? So the EPS path visualization shows how R&D can hurt reported earnings now but potentially support higher long-term growth. So this is useful for illustrating agency tensions. Managers focused on short-term EPS may avoid high value innovation projects. So to close, I want to reflect on the stakeholder implications and the underlying value drivers.\n\nSo the retail shareholders,\nyeah, the retail shareholders um benefit similarly under buybacks, dividends, and debt reduction, but dividends deliver cash immediately. Institutional investors, especially Birkshshire, benefit from most from buybacks because ownership concentration increases. management and employment and employees benefit from higher share prices and higher option value in the buyback and acquisition scenarios. And then bond holders strongly prefer debt reduction which dramatically reduces risk. So when it comes to value creation versus value transfer buybacks only create value if the shares are over undervalued otherwise they mainly redistribute wealth. dividends simply transfer cash and then high ROIC investments like acquisitions and R&D create genuine long-term value when executed well. So my final recommendation um is not to execute the full $90 billion buyback. Instead, a balanced capital allocation strategy is superior. a moderate buyback in the 50 to60 billion range to return capital, some debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet and preserving cash for high ROIC innovation or acquisition opportunities especially in AI and spatial computing. So this blend strategy off or this blended strategy offers EPS improvement, lower risk, strong signaling, better stakeholder balance, and more long-term strategic flexibility. And that concludes my driver analysis of Apple's $90 billion buyback proposal. Thank you."
