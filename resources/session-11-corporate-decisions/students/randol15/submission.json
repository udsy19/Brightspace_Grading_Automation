  "transcript": "All right. So, for today's assignment,\nwe are doing an Apple n Apple's $90\nbillion uh\nApple Pie back. Um, and we'll start\ndirectly with uh so I had my AI act as a\nfinancial analyst. Um, and I had to\nexplain these concepts to me and we're\ngoing to create our own uh we're going\nto go through the we're going to go\nthrough the basic concepts at the start\nand then we're going to look at our code\nand we're going to make in we're going\nto make a recommendation based on that\ncode and we're going to see if that\nlines up with what our AI says. Righty.\nSo here we'll start with the driver\nportion of this. So here we see Apple's\ncurrent position the 165 165 billion\nshare or cash and investments.\nUh free cash flow is 100 billion that's\n110 billion free shares 15.5 billion\nprice per share 185 billion um EPS is\n$6.17\nnet income 95.6 6 billion per year. And\nhere are our alternatives for the OO\nscenario.\nUm, and so the key issues that the AI\nflagged is a scale versus cash\ngeneration. 90 billion is just under one\nyear of the free cash flows. We can do\nthis without stressing uh liquidity, but\nit'll cause significant changes in debt.\nAnd the valuation context is a rich mega\ncap and buying back is only value\naccredited if the intrinsic earnings\nyield is greater than the cost of equity\nand Apple lacks projects with higher\nrisk adjusted returns.\nSo the stakeholder incentives incentives\nit's good for the CEO\num uh cuz his competition is tied to EPS\nand so he's infair. Birkshshire prefers\ndisciplined capital returns but they\nhate overpaying. The employees benefit\nfrom price support and lower dilution\nand bond holders care about cover\ncoverage and net leverage but some might\nprefer that debt reduction. Um\nalternative test we can use dividends\nuh acquisition R&D and debt reduction\nfor the modest financial value. So for\nrepresenting\nit starts over here. our co- modeling\nchoices. It had us build a simple\nparameterized model\num the inputs price over equity shares\ncash debt tax rate after tax interest\nand debt um and the outputs shares net\noutcome EPS\ndebt to net income and 90 billion is a\ncommon budget for all of these.\nSo here are base numbers and these are\nthe scenario actions. So the buyback,\nspecial dividend, debt reduction,\nAI acquisition,\nincremental R&D, and then that interest\non the yield. And so for implement, we\nhave our code right here.\nSo\ngo down and then this is what it looks\nlike. So our shares from the base\nis is 15.5 billion and for the buyback\nit does go down. So the shares um so we\nknow that that works. Um the net income\nfor the buyback\ngoes down a little and the EPS raises.\nSo\nthat means that the buyback does work as\nwe expected it to.\nUm\nthe\nhere it's easier to probably show this.\nSo this is our EPS.\nAnd as you can see, they're all pretty\nsimilar. The ones that have the best EPS\nare the AI acquisition and incremental\nR&D. And this is our debt reduction. And\nthis is our fiveax scenario. And those\nare very similar.\nUm,\nonce again,\nAI acquisition and R&D\nup here in in the net income,\nbut the base action and the debt\nreduction are the only two that lower\nour debt ratio. Otherwise, we're all\nwe're always at this high debt ratio.\nAnd our leverage here, once again,\nhigh leverage here, lower leverage\nthere. So we're essentially trading off\nrisk in debt for returns in uh capital.\nUm\nso like we see here these these net\nincomes\nare what we would normally get or what\nwe want to base this off of. We're\nlooking for shareholder value. That's\nour main driver for this decision. Um\nand as we saw back here,\nour shareholders or stakeholders are\nworried about\num\noh yeah stakeholder incentives\nthey are worried most of them are for\nthe buyback.\nThe CEO is for the buyback.\nThe employees would be for the buyback.\nbond holders. Some may be for the\nbuyback and Birkshshire prefers that\ndiscipline capital return which is on\nthe buyback but the buyback may cost us\nor it may be overpaying for this. So\nbased on this\nI would want to go with the option that\nhas the highest overall returns while\nkeeping us safe and risk-f free. And for\nme,\nthat\nlooks like the\nthat looks like the buyback.\nUm,\nit's\nup here in the EPS,\nup here in the net income,\nand it doesn't have the possible risk\nthat these two do. This R&D, it could\nend up wasted, and this acquisition has\na pro the problem of companies\noverreaching for their uh for their\nacquisition. and they get too confident\nin their ability to handle that\nacquisition and end up failing on the\nback end. So, the debt reduction and the\nbuyback look like the best two options\nfor us. Like we said, the buyback is a\nvery\ncash heavy incentive. You could do it,\nbut it messes up your debt and equity\nratios. So, rather than going full\nbuyback, I would do a combination of the\ntwo, the debt reduction and the buyback.\nAnd that way you can increase your share\nuh that way you can increase the or\ndecrease the shares added and increase\nyour share valuation while also lowering\nyour debt ratio and lowering that risk\nportfolio. And so now we're going to\ntake a look at what the AI recommends\non this.\nUm before that we want to validate\nthough. So just our sanity checks 90\nbillion is just under a year's free cash\nflow. We can fund this out out of\noperations without jeopardizing. So it's\nnot a solveny but an opportunity cost\nquestion. Like we said before, we want\nto maximize our gains while minimizing\nrisk. So the valuation c cost of capital\nuh is around 3%. because it's 30 times.\nUm the buyback at 30 times is not\nattractive unless Apple foresees\nearnings growth greater than what we\ncurrently have or the market is\nunrestrained and its durable competitive\nadvantages underestimating its dur\ndurable competitive advantages. For the\nmarket model sensitivity,\nwe drop return on invested capital\nacquisition on R&D to 5%. they no longer\ndominate the buyback and become roughly\nvalue neutral. Um, if valuation were\ncheaper, the buyback's value creation\npotential improves.\nI mean, then for agency governance,\nit like the small low-risisk bumps are\nvery attractive to CEO. Uh but for board\noversight, they should force explicit\nreturn on invested capital uh\ncomparisons\nshow that by that beats the R&D or M&A\npipeline based on a risk adjusted basis\nor guard rails such as no repurchases\nabove that 20 uh PE of 20 price over\nequity of 20\nif uh high return on invested capital\nproject exists. this\num for the evolve scenario\nwe could set a capacity allocation\nhierarchy so fully fund the R&D and AI\nprojects the expected RO return on\ninvested capital in whack plus a clear\nline of sight uh we can maintain the\ntarget net cash over net income rate to\nprotect the bond holder confidence and\nbuyback stock only when valuation is\nless than or equal to X so we're given\nanother around 20 number or we could\ndesign a more nuanced buyback like I was\nsaying before. We could do that half\nbuyback or partial buyback, partial debt\nreduction, sort of advancing that\nbuyback into something more viable\nrather than just throwing 90 billion at\nit and calling it a day. Um, and then we\nhave more stakeholder communications.\nUh, frame buybacks as a residual use of\ncapital after investments, not as like\nthe go-to. So, sort of\nlike again the the my scenario before.\nOkay, we did this uh debt reduction, got\na little bit left. We can do a buyback\nand that'll rate that'll bump that uh\nEPS a little bit and we get more for\nmore bang for our buck sort of. Um, and\nso we'll go on to the reflect. Uh, and\nthis is our this is what we learn here.\nSo the $9 buyback only provides a modest\nuplift and that increases net leverage.\nIt benefits long-term taxable\nshareholders versus a dividend that\naligns more with a brier, but it looks\nlike more of a value transfer than real\nvalue creation at this multiple. Like\nthey were saying before, the debt\nreduction delivers similar EPS with\nbetter downside protection, hard uh\nreturn, high return on invested capital\nwith the R&D and AI dominance to buy\nback if Apple truly has such\nopportunities. But like we said before,\nthose opportunities come with greater\nmuch greater risks, not only in the\nfinancial sector, but also in the\nbusiness administration sector. So the\nAI view, Apple should not execute a full\nbuyback unless the uh price over equity\nat at this current price over equity\nrate unless it demonstrates that it's\nincremental\nAI and R&D pipeline cannot reasonably\nabsorb a a meaningful portion of that\nreturn on invested capital uh of that\ncapital at a return on invested greater\nthan the whack and the valuation falls\ncloser to that mid20s multiple.\nUm the recommendation is that the AI\nwould scale the buyback\nand allocate 30 billion 30 to 40 billion\nto high conviction R&D or use 20 use 20\nbillion to optically reduce the gross\ndebt keeping that cash robust. So we\nwere close we were very close to their\nuh actual recommendation.\nI I guess I'm a little bit more\nriskaverse in terms of bis the business\nadministration side of R&D and uh\nacquisitions but the sentiment that you\nshouldn't do the full buyback and should\nsplit the money into a buyback and some\nother um some other scenarios as well to\nsort of maximize that princip to sort of\nmaximize your return on investment is\nthere um and for the broader principles\nthat the AI is teaching us in\nuh buybacks at high multiples are mostly\ntools of value transfer and not creation\nunless the market is mixing the stock.\nGovernment must align with buyback\ndecisions. Um and then stakeholder\nfairness means favoring tax efficient\nmechanisms over blunt ones but not at\nthe expense of underinvesting\nand innovation.\nUm and a robust capital allocation\nframework always starts with what is my\nbest risk adjusted project and should I\nreturn what's left by buybacks or\ndividends.\nAll right. Thank you."
