  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student comprehensively covered all primary stakeholders—shareholders (retail and institutional), management, and bondholders—while also addressing employees across each option, showing breadth and application. Despite a minor inaccuracy, the coverage is thorough and appears in multiple DRIVER stages, satisfying completeness at an introductory level.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly narrated the results of visual/tabular outputs, citing specific scenario EPS figures and a percent change, and tied those outputs to stakeholder impacts across alternatives. They also referenced the scenario parameters (e.g., 8% ROI) while comparing trade-offs. This satisfies a thorough, scenario-by-scenario verbal description under moderate standards.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The transcript explicitly documents a Discover/Define stage (problem, stakeholders, objectives) and labels it as such, and then proceeds to Represent and Implement stages. Because the D-stage is clearly completed and documented before modeling, the criterion is satisfied.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies that higher debt increases financial risk and that reducing debt improves credit profile and safety, satisfying the risk side of the trade-off. However, they do not mention the tax benefits of debt (interest tax shield) at all. Given the clear but incomplete treatment, this merits a PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies major stakeholders and broadly who benefits under buybacks, dividends, debt reduction, and R&D, showing basic agency considerations. However, they do not explain asset substitution or risk shifting tied to leverage/buybacks, omit large-holder-specific conflicts, and include an inaccuracy (“Institutional investors will not get anything” under dividends). Coverage is correct but surface-level, so this meets a partial, not thorough, standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly links debt to EPS via interest costs and acknowledges risk effects (credit rating, safer balance sheet), showing basic understanding of how financing choice affects risk and return. However, they do not thoroughly explain leverage’s bidirectional amplification of returns and risks or explicitly note fixed interest obligations and default risk. Coverage is brief and incomplete, so the criterion is only partially met.",
