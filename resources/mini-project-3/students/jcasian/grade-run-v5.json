  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application: it ingests unstructured goals, produces structured savings scenarios/recommendations, outputs to Excel, and the student validated the numeric results matched manual calculations. The DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Reflect) show deliberate development and verification, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows a clear, working AI integration: the AI converts unstructured user language into structured financial outputs, is embedded in NA10 with Excel export, and was validated by manual recalculation. Iterative DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Reflect) demonstrate deliberate engineering to make the AI reliable, satisfying the criterion for effective AI integration.",
