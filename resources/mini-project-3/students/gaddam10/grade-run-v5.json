  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student explicitly built and demonstrated a working financial scenario generator that accepts financial prompts, produces scenario analyses, and outputs runnable Python code for accurate calculations. Implementation evidence (code tool ran, example retirement comparison, guardrail) plus reflection on accuracy show the tool functions as a financial application, meeting the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration (Gemini model with memory, system message/guardrail, and a runnable code tool) that adds clear value by producing scenarios and reproducible calculations. The student also reflected on limitations and used code to ensure accuracy, demonstrating multiple integrated AI components and thoughtful implementation.",
