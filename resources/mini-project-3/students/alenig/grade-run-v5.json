  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that retrieves price/news data, performs analysis, and produces actionable recommendations (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT). The student acknowledged a minor unresolved feature (graph) but confirmed the workflow runs and outputs financial results, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated an LLM (Claude) as a core chatbot component, connected it with data tools (price feed, company news), and produced actionable outputs (recommendations and reasoning) demonstrated with examples. The description of system nodes, iterative improvement, and a live execution supporting multiple stocks shows effective AI integration beyond superficial use.",
