You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial pipeline: fetching financial statements, computing metrics (debt-to-equity, current ratio), and generating/refining AI-driven financial analysis with a concrete Apple example and numeric outputs. Implementation and reflective evidence indicate the tool functions as a financial application, satisfying the PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes and demonstrates a functioning AI integration (Zapier + API + prompts) that computes metrics and uses ChatGPT to generate and refine substantive financial analysis, showing clear added value rather than superficial use. The combined Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence indicates a thorough, effective integration.",
