  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student provides concrete claims and implementation evidence that the tool performs financial tasks (investment scenarios, expected returns, risks) and returns structured results via an operational workflow. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT quotes show both intent and functioning implementation, meeting the criterion for a functioning financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration (Gemini) tied into a functioning workflow that ingests user input and external data and returns structured outputs, plus iterative improvements to prompts and format. Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence collectively demonstrate AI is integrated meaningfully and adds value, meeting PASS criteria.",
