So here as we can see I\nhave a telegram trigger that updates\nbased on a message that I sent which in\nthis case is Apple and it does goes\nthrough the open a chat model um and a\nsimple window buffer memory and thus um\ngoes through this tool which is get\nchart as we can see through the second\nworkflow that I have which gets the\nworkflow input trigger which is the\napple in this case sets the ticker and\ngets the chart URL from\nfrom the API chart um API chart website\ndownloads the chart and then from there\ndoes a technical analysis using the open\nAI um chat model and then sends the\nchart as a photo as we can see here this\nis the first thing that we see and here\nas we can see we have a chart of the the\nrecent Apple\num stock prices. Next, um\nwe can ask it to essentially analyze\nthis and do a technical analysis for\nApple based on this chart and based on\nthe recent trends and collects the data\nfrom from various sources and gives me a\nclear image as to what I want.\nAdditionally, once I ask it to explain\nit, it can go further and explain some\nof the the the thoughts that it has and\nthus makes much more easier to for me to\nchoose whether I want to buy, sell or\nhold this particular um this particular\nstock."
