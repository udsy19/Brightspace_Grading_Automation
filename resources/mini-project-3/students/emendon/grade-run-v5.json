Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working financial tool that fetches stock charts, runs technical analysis, and provides actionable buy/sell/hold guidance. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear, concrete evidence that the application performs financial tasks, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates an AI model into a working workflow and shows functional value (chart analysis and trading guidance), but treatment is high-level and lacks depth (no detailed explanation of prompts, model behavior, validation, or multiple examples). This meets a sound but basic integration, so PARTIAL.",
