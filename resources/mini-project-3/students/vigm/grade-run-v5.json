You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application that ingests cash flow, assets/liabilities, goals and risk tolerance and produces concrete, actionable financial advice (e.g., debt-paydown plan). Implement and Reflect stages show iteration, safety checks, and realistic scenario outputs, meeting the criterion for a functioning financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration (Gemini) that transforms messy inputs into personalized, structured recommendations and includes safety checks and scenario comparisons. Iterative implementation and validation with real student cases demonstrate the AI adds clear functional value, meeting PASS criteria.",
