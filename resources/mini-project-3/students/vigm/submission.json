  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Meher and for this mini\n0:06\nproject I wanted to build something that\n0:08\ncollege students can actually use and\n0:11\nthey actually need which is a simple\n0:14\nfinancial\n0:16\nadvisor that tells you what to do with\n0:18\nyour money. So, I built an app that\n0:22\nhelps students decide between saving,\n0:25\npaying off debt, investing based on\n0:29\ntheir own profile.\n0:33\nSo AI makes this way smarter because it\n0:37\nt it can take messy inputs like for\n0:40\nexample I have $500 saved and $200 of\n0:44\ndebt and\n0:47\nwant to start investing and turn that\n0:50\ninto a personalized recommendation.\n0:55\nSo\n0:57\nthat was the second part of um the\n1:01\ndriver framework and I implement I\n1:05\ndecided to use Google AI studio with\n1:09\nGemini as the brain and version one was\n1:13\nsimple.\n1:15\nUh the model of version one took the\n1:19\nstudents info and give one\n1:21\nrecommendation. So then for version two,\n1:24\nI decided to improve it by adding\n1:26\nstructured output scenario comparisons,\n1:29\nsafety checks for high interest debt,\n1:33\nand clear explanations. And now the app\n1:36\nreturns a summary,\n1:38\nmultiple scenarios, pros and cons, and a\n1:42\nrecommendation option, and a disclaimer.\n1:49\nUh later I will do a deep dive into the\n1:53\napp and then next I validate my results\n1:58\nby testing it with real student\n2:00\nsituations like having credit card debt\n2:03\nor low savings and checked whether the\n2:07\nrecommendations were safe, consistent\n2:09\nand aligned with basic finan finance\n2:12\nrules. It's\n2:15\nit stays\n2:18\nIt stayed con uh conservative and\n2:20\navoided risky suggestions. However, this\n2:23\nmodel has different options of uh\n2:27\ndifferent levels of risk.\n2:31\nAnd then E evolve to further improve\n2:35\nthis model. I added clearer guard rails\n2:39\nand made the language more beginner\n2:41\nfriendly. the output now feels more\n2:44\ntrustworthy and easier to understand.\n2:48\nAnd lastly, our reflect. I built this um\n2:53\nand this showed me how different it is\n2:56\nto use AI as part of a system.\n3:00\nIt's about safety, structure, and making\n3:02\nsure that the model actually helps the\n3:04\nuser instead of conf confusing them. And\n3:07\nAI makes the experience\n3:12\nmore conversational and personal which\n3:14\nis something\n3:17\nnormal calculators can do. So\n3:25\nusing the driver framework\n3:27\nI\n3:29\nmade this app and\n3:32\nuh and now I will go ahead and show\n3:36\num how it works. So first it asks for um\n3:40\nthe monthly income of the student after\n3:42\ncash. So here it already gives me the\n3:45\nexample of 1,500. So let's go ahead and\n3:48\nput in 1,500. And then for monthly\n3:50\nexpenses, suppose I spent 1,200.\n3:54\nAnd it gives examples of what the\n3:58\nmonthly income is and what expenses are.\n4:04\nSo this was the cash flow, what's coming\n4:06\nin and going out. Now we will take a\n4:09\nlook at assets and liabilities. So, for\n4:13\ntotal savings, let's say we have\n4:17\n$20,000 saved up\n4:20\nand we are in total depth of\n4:26\n10,000\n4:28\nand then let's say that\n4:32\nthe interest rate is\n4:36\n15%.\n4:41\nor let's say it's 10%, since it's a\n4:44\nprivate student loan.\n4:48\nSo now uh we can put our goals and risks\n4:52\nand uh it says here we prioritize safety\n4:55\nbut we want to know your goals. So for\n4:57\nexample, let's say we want to start\n4:59\ninvesting\n5:01\nand another goal could be that we\n5:05\nwant to buy a car.\n5:10\nin the next years.\n5:15\nSo now there's different options between\n5:17\nlow risk, which is I want to keep my\n5:20\nmoney safe above all else. Medium risk,\n5:23\nI can handle small dips for better\n5:25\nlong-term growth, and high risk, I'm\n5:28\nwilling to take risks. Advice will still\n5:30\nbe safe and conservative.\n5:33\nSo let's take\n5:35\na safe plan.\n5:41\nAnd now it's analyzing my profile. And\n5:44\nnow it will tell me and build a\n5:48\npersonalized road map for me.\n5:51\nSo it tells me my safety score. And\n5:54\ncurrently it's saying that\n5:57\nI\n5:59\num have $10,000 depth with 10% interest\n6:03\nrate, which is quite high and needs\n6:05\nimmediate attention. So now it's telling\n6:07\nme that um my steps in terms of\n6:13\npriority.\n6:15\nSo\n6:17\nit's telling me that my first step that\n6:21\nI should act on is focus on all extra\n6:24\n$300 a month on paying down the $10,000\n6:28\ndebt with the 10% interest rate. So this\n6:31\nwill save a significant amount of money\n6:33\nand interest over time and it's best to\n6:35\nreturn\n6:37\nyou can get right now.\n6:41\nSo and then the next step is to make a\n6:44\nplan for purchasing a car. So once my\n6:47\nhigh interest debt is fully paid off,\n6:49\nredirect the $300 you were using for\n6:52\ndebt payments towards a dedicated\n6:56\nsavings account for my car\n7:00\nand then start investing in broad market\n7:03\nfunds. So this is the\n7:07\nlist of steps that I should do based on\n7:09\nmy profile. And now let's see if I\n7:13\nchange my profile up a little bit.\n7:18\nSo, let's say I have $50,000 saved.\n7:25\nI'm in debt $5,000\n7:29\nand my interest rate is 5%\n7:36\nand my goals are still the same. start\n7:38\ninvesting.\n7:43\nAnd my other goal is buy a car\n7:49\nnext.\n7:54\nAnd my risk tolerance is still the same.\n8:00\nSo now it's analyzing my profile and\n8:05\nit will\n8:07\ngive me a safety score of 90. So,\n8:10\ncompared to my 45 to my 90,\n8:13\nit's first telling me again is still the\n8:16\nsame thing. Pay off my student debt and\n8:19\nthen save for my car purchase and then\n8:25\nstart investing conservatively.\n8:28\nSo it tells me that\n8:33\nbased on different scenarios, it'll give\n8:35\nme different advice and\n8:38\nand yeah, so this is the AI tool that I\n8:43\nuse, Google AI studio to build my uh\n8:48\nfinancial advisor app for college\n8:49\nstudents.\n8:51Thank you."
