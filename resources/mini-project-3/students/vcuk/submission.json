It\n0:15\nshould analyze, explain andor advice on\n0:17\nfinancial decisions using AI as the\n0:20\nbrain.\n0:23\nOkay. So for the progression main\n0:25\nproject one, you can build things. Two,\n0:27\nyou can build financial tools. Three,\n0:29\nyou can build intelligent financial\n0:30\ntools.\n0:34\nSo if we basically get started,\n0:38\nso number one thing that I found in\n0:41\ntonight was to implement error handling\n0:44\nfor external APIs workflow currently\n0:47\nassumes the fetch mark will always\n0:49\nsucceed. So basically just talking about\n0:51\nthis for a new node error cache and a\n0:55\nnew node with the fallback data.\n0:58\nThe type for a new node error cach is a\n1:00\ncach error. The actions is placed\n1:03\nimmediately after fetch market data\n1:06\nand the new node fallback data for the\n1:08\nand function is to\n1:11\nif the fetch market data fails. This\n1:13\nnode provides a static safe market data\n1:15\ninput\n1:17\num and make the market data dynamic.\n1:20\nCurrently you are hard coding the symbol\n1:21\nto while spy is a good proxy more\n1:26\nsophisticated visor might fetch d for\n1:28\nsymbols reent relevant to the user's\n1:31\nrisk tolerance of goal and here are some\n1:34\nimprovement strategies\n1:37\na new for symbol router switch placed\n1:40\nafter reprocessing it reads risk\n1:42\ntolerance for the user data\n1:47\nand if we take a look at This the little\n1:50\ncode and this code right here and\n1:56\nhere are some of the codes that I was\n1:58\nwritten up. There's a mile shown here\n2:01\nwith a goal of retirement with a\n2:03\ntimeline of three years. The moderate\n2:05\nhere's tolerance.\n2:10\nSo here is the coding for like just an\n2:13\nexample\n2:15\nfor a little house with amount of 12,000\n2:19\nthe goal of house down payment with the\n2:21\ntimeline four years with the result\n2:24\nand then here show here shows the\n2:26\nrecommendations\n2:28\nright here\n2:30\nbalance ETF\n2:32\nhigh interest savings account and robo\n2:34\nadvisor moderate portfolio\n2:41\nlook down and see more of the coding\n2:44\nthat I did.\n2:54\nAlso scroll up to see my process.\n2:59\nSo\n3:02\nthis is the workflow structure and\n3:04\nfunction.\n3:06\nSo the node name of web hook\n3:09\nhas purpose of being triggered and\n3:11\ninitiates the workflow when external\n3:13\nHTTP post is sent to the finance advice\n3:16\npath\n3:17\nuh preprocessing\n3:19\nwhich extract extracts\n3:22\nrelevant user inputs um from the\n3:24\nincoming web hook request body and\n3:26\nformats them into a clean JSON object\n3:30\nfor the next steps. It's custom\n3:32\nJavaScript to map and return user people\n3:35\nfields. Fetch marker data which is an\n3:38\nexternal data retrieval calls the alpha\n3:41\nuh vantage API to get data time series\n3:44\ndata for the spyf.\n3:47\nIt points to alpha vantage API for spy\n3:51\ndata.\n3:53\nAI analysis is a core logic analysis. It\n3:56\nuses the GPT4 model to act as a\n3:59\nfinancial advisor. It takes the user\n4:00\ndata and the market data as input and it\n4:04\nprompts the AI to suggest two investment\n4:06\noptions in structure JSON format\n4:09\npost-processing\n4:11\nextracts the AI generated advice from\n4:14\nthe upstream nodes output and formats it\n4:16\nfor the final response extracts the\n4:18\nadvice field from the AI output um the\n4:21\nresponse to user. It sends the final\n4:24\nformatted investment device back to the\n4:25\nsystem that initiated the web hook\n4:27\nrequest and it sends the JSON output to\n4:31\noutput of the post-processing\n4:34\nnode.\n4:41\nYou can see\n4:43\nthis uh code that\n4:47\ngo back to see.\n4:50\nOkay, here we go.\n4:53\nright here where where it talks about\n4:54\nthe suggesting SM options reasoning and\n4:58\nI went through that earlier those\n5:00\noptions\n5:04\nand this is an example with the fetch\n5:06\nmarket data with a position of 10\n5:09\n1050,500\n5:13\nby 200 and the parameters positions\n5:18\nit shows all the different parameters\n5:21\num there's a connection right here with\n5:22\nthe low risk, medium risk, and high\n5:24\nrisk."
