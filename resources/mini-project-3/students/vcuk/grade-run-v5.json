Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application pipeline: external market-data retrieval, AI-based financial analysis, and formatted investment recommendations. Concrete implementation details and example outputs in the Implement stage show functional financial task performance, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI as the core decision engine (uses GPT‑4 to generate structured investment advice) and ties it into a data pipeline (market data fetch + post‑processing). The described workflow and example outputs demonstrate meaningful, non‑superficial AI use, meeting PASS-level expectations for this moderate evaluation.",
