  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it retrieves market data, runs a predictive model, and outputs investment-related metrics (current/30-day price, percent gain/loss, recommendations). Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence together show the tool functions for financial decision support, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI is meaningfully integrated (a regression model predicts prices and drives recommendations) and provides concrete examples of outputs and alternatives, plus iterative AI-driven development. These elements indicate the AI adds functional value beyond a superficial mention, meeting the PASS standard.",
