  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows the tool produces financial outputs (sentiment score, price/change, buy/sell verdict) and performs computations and comparisons between stocks, demonstrating functioning financial application (Implement and Discover). The student also reflects on usefulness and improvement, indicating a coherent end-to-end financial app workflow, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI features (automated analysis, sentiment scoring, plain-English summaries, comparative output) and an implemented enhancement to compare two stocks, demonstrating the AI adds real value. Driver stages (Discover/Implement/Reflect) provide clear evidence the AI integration is functional and purposeful rather than superficial.",
