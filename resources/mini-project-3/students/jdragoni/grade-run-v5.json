  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application (SWR calculator) with concrete inputs, Monte Carlo/scenario simulations, and meaningful outputs (annual income, survival rate, final balance). The student shows both conceptual design (Discover) and executed implementation (Implement) with multiple example runs, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates substantive AI integration across multiple DRIVER stages: ideation and modeling with Gemini, prompt engineering, and implementation in Google AI Studio, plus AI-driven validation scenarios. This goes beyond superficial mention and shows the AI added concrete design and implementation value, satisfying PASS.",
