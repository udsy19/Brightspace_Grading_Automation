  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly defined and implemented a working financial tool (an SWR calculator) and demonstrated its functionality with multiple simulations and concrete outputs (portfolio trajectories, withdrawals, survival rates). The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Validate/Reflect) provide direct evidence that the app performs financial tasks, meeting the PASS standard for thoroughness.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows concrete, repeated use of AI (Gemini + Google AI Studio) to design, implement, and validate the SWR tool, including AI-generated prompts, scenario inputs, and human-readable explanations of year-by-year actions. They also reflect on limitations and prompt engineering, indicating substantive integration rather than superficial use.",
