  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application: it uses AI to generate personalized investment guides, shows specific portfolio allocations and trade-offs, and dynamically updates reports with successful workflow execution (Discover + Implement). This meets the criterion that the tool functions and performs financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly describes and demonstrates AI integration (OpenAI LLMs, multi-node pipeline, dynamic scenario-driven outputs and rendered client reports), showing that AI adds substantive functionality rather than being superficial. The Discover and Implement stages provide specific technical and functional evidence of effective integration, meeting the PASS standard.",
