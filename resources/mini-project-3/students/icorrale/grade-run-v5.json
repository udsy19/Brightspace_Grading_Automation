  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application: a finance-tutoring app with lessons, flashcards, quizzes, progress tracking and an AI Q&A, and reports having programmed and verified the content. The DRIVER stages (Discover/Implement/Reflect) show iterative development and functional delivery, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive, functional AI integration (tutor Q&A, AI-generated flashcards, adaptive quizzing/progress tracking) and iterative implementation to achieve it. Multiple concrete examples and the described driver loops demonstrate the AI adds clear value rather than being superficial.",
