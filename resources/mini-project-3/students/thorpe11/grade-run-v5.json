  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working financial tool that accepts financial inputs, produces quantitative scenarios (monthly savings, return assumptions, percentages) and generates recommendations. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence shows the app was built and functional; REFLECT shows meaningful financial interpretation, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows clear, functional integration of AI (Google AI Studio) that produces both numeric analyses and visualizations and provides scenario-based recommendations, not just superficial labeling. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence shows deliberate prompt engineering and output customization, and the REFLECT stage shows critical use of the AI outputs, supporting a thorough, value-adding integration.",
