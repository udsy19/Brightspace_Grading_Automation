This is my\n\n2\n00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,830\nManagement 310 Mini Project\n3 Build and Advanced\n\n3\n00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,630\nAI Finance Tool with\nN8N or any platform.\n\n4\n00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,790\nSo basically, the\nassignment for this mini\n\n5\n00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,290\nproject was build\na more advanced AI\n\n6\n00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,170\ntool using any platform\nof our choice. It\n\n7\n00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,210\nshould analyze,\nexplain, and advise on\n\n8\n00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,470\nfinancial decision\nusing AI as the brain.\n\n9\n00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,730\nAnd it's pretty much\nopen-ended. And we're\n\n10\n00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,030\njust supposed to use\nbasic driver loops to\n\n11\n00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,690\nbuild on our AI\nintegration, where our goal\n\n12\n00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,550\nis for Mini Project 3\nto build intelligent\n\n13\n00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,590\nfinance tools and\nmake its functionality\n\n14\n00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,170\nand purpose even more\nexpanded based off of,\n\n15\n00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,250\nyou know, our previous\ntwo, Mini Project 1\n\n16\n00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,990\nand Mini Project 2.\nin this case I took\n\n17\n00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,190\ninspiration from one of\nthe inspiration examples\n\n18\n00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,590\nI decided to do build\na financial health\n\n19\n00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,590\nadvisor that analyzes\nyour current spending\n\n20\n00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,270\nhabits and then advises\nyou on your next\n\n21\n00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,030\nsteps in terms of\nbetter budgeting better\n\n22\n00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,590\nspending habits so\nfor this I listened to\n\n23\n00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,450\nProfessor Zhang's\nrecommendation of trying out\n\n24\n00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,650\nand using Google AI\nStudio so in Google AI\n\n25\n00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,410\nStudio I just very\nsimply used a little\n\n26\n00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,570\nbit of prompt engineering\nand I thought about\n\n27\n00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,790\nit in terms of the\ndriver framework where\n\n28\n00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,130\nI was like okay I want\nto obviously have a\n\n29\n00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,750\nfinancial health advisor\ntool that will take\n\n30\n00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,330\nin input of your current\nstate of finances\n\n31\n00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:57,010\nand output you\nbasically, I guess, an\n\n32\n00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,750\nimproved budget or a\nbetter finance plan for\n\n33\n00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,430\nthe next month going\nforward on your financial\n\n34\n00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,230\nspending and decision\n-making process. That\n\n35\n00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,070\nwas my first driver\nloop where I made a\n\n36\n00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,650\nvery simple, basic app\nwith Google AIS Studio.\n\n37\n00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,290\nAnd then when I went\nthrough my second\n\n38\n00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,890\ndriver loop, I started\nadding in, you know,\n\n39\n00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,030\nlike graphs and diagrams\nthat help support\n\n40\n00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,530\nthe current and\nrecommended spending\n\n41\n00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,530\nhabits. And then for\nthe third driver loop, I\n\n42\n00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,510\nimproved it by\nactually taking into\n\n43\n00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,670\nconsideration the psychology\nof the spender and\n\n44\n00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,410\nbehavioral habits and\nthen actual specific\n\n45\n00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,190\nrecommendations and\nbuilding up a checklist\n\n46\n00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,830\nof steps for a user\nto take to improve\n\n47\n00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,370\ntheir spending habits.\nSo basically, here\n\n48\n00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,210\nis my app. It's\nfully built by Google\n\n49\n00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,450\nAI Studio. So here\nit's called FinTherapy.\n\n50\n00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,870\nSo it's the compassionate\nfinancial diagnosis,\n\n51\n00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,990\nwhere just uploading\nyour spending data\n\n52\n00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,630\nthat you have will\nanalyze your behavioral\n\n53\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,010\npatterns, protect the\ncredit score, as well\n\n54\n00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,090\nas give you a 90-day\ntransformation plan\n\n55\n00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,690\nto improve your spending\nand financial habits.\n\n56\n00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,820\nwhich in consideration\nit takes behavioral\n\n57\n00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,250\npsychology understanding\nthe why and how\n\n58\n00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,670\nyou spend data-driven\nplans that are created\n\n59\n00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,350\ndependent on your\ncurrent spending happens\n\n60\n00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,290\nand credit protection\nit optimizes to boost\n\n61\n00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,790\nyour credit score\nand prevent any other\n\n62\n00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,490\nharm so it's very\nsimple we are trying to\n\n63\n00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,030\nbasically submit a csv\nor a spreadsheet file\n\n64\n00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,930\nwith the date description\nand the amount of\n\n65\n00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,770\nmoney so um for me here\ni have a very simple\n\n66\n00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,370\nuh file that i'm\ngoing to upload it's\n\n67\n00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,970\ncalled test transactions\n.csv we're going to add\n\n68\n00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,810\nthat in there and while\nthat runs i'm just\n\n69\n00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,550\ngoing to open it here\non my download end\n\n70\n00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,450\nand here if we pop up\nit'll turn into a csv\n\n71\n00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,770\nin vs code for us it's\nbasically giving us\n\n72\n00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,810\nthe dates the description\nof what actual\n\n73\n00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,870\ncharge it is and then\nthe amount of the charge\n\n74\n00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,150\nand then I guess it's\npersonalized a category\n\n75\n00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,950\nof what it goes\nin either shopping\n\n76\n00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,310\ntransportation food\nentertainment etc and it's\n\n77\n00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,790\nfor the entirety of\nthe month of October so\n\n78\n00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,970\nbased on that we are\ngoing to be our AI app\n\n79\n00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,290\ntool here is going to\ngive us an expected\n\n80\n00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,530\nplan for the next month\nof November of how\n\n81\n00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,130\nwe should spend how\nshould we try to cut down\n\n82\n00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,270\nour charges and\nexpenditures given our CSV\n\n83\n00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,750\nsheet so right now\nobviously our app is\n\n84\n00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,810\ngoing to take a few\nseconds just to process all\n\n85\n00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,990\nthe CSV data that\nwe've given it with the\n\n86\n00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,670\ndate description amount\nand in a few seconds,\n\n87\n00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,790\nwe should get our\nintended next steps and\n\n88\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,750\nI guess in this case,\nfin therapy of what\n\n89\n00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,360\nwe should do. So here,\nwe just got our fin\n\n90\n00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,030\ntherapy report where our\nhealth score, financial\n\n91\n00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,730\nhealth score in this\ncase is 45 on 100.\n\n92\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,550\nIt tells us how much we\n\n93\n00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,950\nspent this\nmuch, so $4,883.\n\n94\n00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,010\nIt breaks it down\ninto essential\n\n95\n00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,450\nexpenses so what\nis actually needed\n\n96\n00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,050\nto survive do our\njobs and live on a\n\n97\n00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,230\ndaily basis and\nthen discretionary\n\n98\n00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,140\nexpenses anything that\nwasn't very essential\n\n99\n00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,530\nto our day-to-day\nlife and then I guess\n\n100\n00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,990\nour savings right here\nwhich currently in\n\n101\n00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,110\nmy spreadsheet demo\nexample there was zero\n\n102\n00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,350\npercent saving which\nis very bad we should\n\n103\n00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,810\nhave a target of at\nleast 20 percent and then\n\n104\n00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,990\nour app here breaks\ndown our spending\n\n105\n00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,250\nbreakdown into pie\nchart that gives us how\n\n106\n00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,670\nmuch a percentage of\nlike how much we spend\n\n107\n00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,880\non housing, how much\nwe spend on groceries,\n\n108\n00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,110\nshopping, transportation,\n\n109\n00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,810\nlet's see like coffee\nand snacks and other\n\n110\n00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,630\nthings in the entire\nmonth of October.\n\n111\n00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,050\nSo that's a very\ngood indication to us\n\n112\n00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,230\nof where our $4,883\nis actually being\n\n113\n00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,650\nput and spent into.\nThis is a good I guess\n\n114\n00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,450\neye-opener for the\nuser in this case.\n\n115\n00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,070\nAnd then here we have\na graph that basically\n\n116\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,790\nshows a bar graph\nin this case that\n\n117\n00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,130\nshows proposed\nbudget shifts. So how\n\n118\n00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,970\nmuch we're supposed\nto cut back or keep\n\n119\n00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,210\nexactly the same. So\nhousing, it says we\n\n120\n00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,290\ncan keep exactly the\nsame. Transportation,\n\n121\n00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,170\nit can keep exactly\nthe same because we\n\n122\n00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,230\nhave to go to work\nand come back home.\n\n123\n00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,870\nGroceries, it definitely\nsays we can cut\n\n124\n00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,570\ndown on how much we\nspend on groceries.\n\n125\n00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,650\nWe don't need all\nthe things we're\n\n126\n00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,950\ngetting. Healthcare\ncan stay the same since\n\n127\n00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,460\nwe have to be insured\nand protected.\n\n128\n00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,310\nUtilities and phone,\nit's telling us that\n\n129\n00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,410\nour current monthly\namount is standard\n\n130\n00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,430\nand does not need to\nbe shifted at all.\n\n131\n00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,570\nAnd then here, projected\nmonthly budget.
