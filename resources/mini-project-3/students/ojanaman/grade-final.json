  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it ingests transaction CSVs, analyzes spending, produces budgets, recommendations, and a 90-day plan (Implement evidence) driven by a stated goal to create a finance advisor (Discover). The depth and concrete outputs shown justify a PASS under the moderate DRIVER-aligned standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly describes AI as the core \"brain\" that ingests CSV data, categorizes transactions, computes a financial health score, produces visualizations, and generates personalized 90-day plans and behavioral recommendations. Implementation evidence (Google AI Studio, prompt engineering, Gemini API) and the detailed description of AI-driven outputs show effective, substantive integration beyond a superficial use, satisfying PASS.",
