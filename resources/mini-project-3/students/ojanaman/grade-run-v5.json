  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript demonstrates a functioning financial application: it ingests transaction CSVs, computes a financial health score and totals, produces category breakdowns and budget recommendations, and outputs a 90-day plan (Implement evidence). The student explicitly framed the project via the DRIVER loops (Discover/Reflect), and the detailed output examples support a thorough, working financial tool, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete AI integration (Google AI Studio/Gemini) that ingests transaction CSVs, categorizes data, generates analytics, visuals, and personalized recommendations — iteratively improved across driver loops. This shows AI adds substantive value beyond a superficial feature, meeting the PASS standard.",
