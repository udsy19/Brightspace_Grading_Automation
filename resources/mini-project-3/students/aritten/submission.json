Uh, it offers stock\nprices. Uh, it advises on whether to buy\nconsidering risk levels and predicts the\nlikelihood of investors profiting. So in\nthis app here, let me move my\nOkay. So as you can see over here, we\ncan enter a stock symbol here. Let me go\nfull screen. We can enter in a stock a\nstock symbol up here. Uh I just put in\nApple.\nUm this is the stock price at the\nbeginning of the day, 28803. Um\nuh it has an AI summary. Apple\ndemonstrates strong financial\nperformance in an ambitious 2026 product\npipeline. But current valuation concerns\nand ongoing regulatory geopolitical risk\nwarrant a cautious hold position while\ncontinued growth is likely significant\nupside may be limited in the near term.\nAnd so then we have a 50% risk level uh\nthat's medium profitability\nuh 65% so they think that you will\nprofit and then there's a deep dive\nanalysis of comprehensive investment\nreport about Apple and it talks about\ntheir finances how much revenue they're\ngetting uh how much increases an 8%\nincrease year-over-year their earnings\nper share um it looks ahead to what\nproducts they're going to have coming\nout um talks about their competitive\nadvantage over their uh competitors such\nas Sony and Microsoft, Samsung, Google,\num their leadership stability. So, all\nthis stuff goes into uh whether or not\nwe should buy Apple or not. And then\nthere's the risk factors and um\nthere's uh several risks, uh regulatory\npressure on the app store and business\npractices and significant ongoing\nconcern with intense scrutiny and\npotential legal challenges that could\nimpact high margin services revenue. Uh\nlike we said earlier, geopolitical\ntensions particularly with China. Uh the\ntariff risks uh also pose potential\nheadwinds for Apple's global supply\nchain and market research. Um\nthe risk assessment we we had medium and\nthen the recommendation\num is to hold if you have it. Um if you\nwere to buy there's a 65% chance that\nyou're going to uh actually make money\nwithin a 6 to 12 month month range. Then\nthese are all of the sources that my app\nuh used to figure out all this stuff.\nNow we'll enter in a new one. Uh this is\nNvidia, their uh their stock ticker\nsymbol um to figure out if we should buy\ninto Nvidia or not,\nwhich personally I say yes. Um but we'll\nsee what the app says. It it usually\ntakes about 30 seconds\nor so.\nThere we go. All right. So, Nvidia\nstrong buy. Um Nvidia's unparalleled\ndominance in the AI hardware and\nsoftware ecosystem coupled with\ncontinuous innovation and strong\nfinancial performance positions for\nsignificant long-term growth despite\ncompetitive pressures and premium\nvaluation. The company's foundational\nrole in AI revolution suggests a high\nlikelihood of positive returns. So, the\nrisk level is medium 50%. So, it's not\ntoo risky. Um, but you're also getting a\nlot of profit, 80% of estimated profit,\nwhich is very, very good for a stock.\nUm,\nuh, deep dive analysis. Uh, yeah, it's\nit's very good. The real time stock\nprice was 88135,\nwhich I think actually took a dip. Yep.\nTook a little bit of a dip today, but at\nthe beginning of the day, uh, it was\npretty good.$187 a share. It's not too\nbad. 1%. bet it'll go up tomorrow. Um,\nbut then we have our qualitative\nfactors. All the news that's happening\nyear after year, Nvidia is going up,\ntheir microchips, their AI, it's Nvidia\nis a very smart investment. Their\nleadership stability, their market\nsentiment, uh the product pipeline,\ntheir competitive advantage, the risk\nfactor, the Nvidia's position is strong.\nUm, there was a little bit of a thing\nlast year when DeepSeek uh came out that\nAI, but since then, I mean, I'm pretty\nsure Deepsee got corrupted and was\ntaking a bunch of information that just\nshowed how pivotal Nvidia is and how\nsecure they are. Um,\nyeah, medium risk and strong buy. Uh,\n80% likelihood. So, this is just a quick\nlittle app. You can put in different\nstocks and um it'll I mean you can see\nall the sources that it it takes from\nand it couples it all together. Shows\nthe risk uh and for the risk and reward\nof investing into a certain stock. Um\nand yeah, that's just my app uh and just\nhelp people with their stock market\ndecisions."
