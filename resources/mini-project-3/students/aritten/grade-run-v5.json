Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a working tool that accepts stock tickers, returns real-time prices, risk assessments, probability of profit, and buy/hold recommendations with supporting sources (Discover and Implement stages). Those concrete outputs and examples (Apple, Nvidia) demonstrate the app functions as a financial application, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive AI integration with multiple concrete outputs (AI-generated summaries, risk assessments, probabilistic profit estimates) and cited sources across examples (Apple and Nvidia). These indicate the AI adds analytic value beyond superficial use, meeting the PASS standard.",
