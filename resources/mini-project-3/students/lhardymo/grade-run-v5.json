You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows an integrated AI workflow (news aggregation, prompt-driven advisory output, automated email delivery) with explicit guardrails and reflection on limitations, demonstrating effective AI integration beyond superficial use. Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence collectively support a thorough, functional integration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application at a basic level—aggregating news into investment-oriented summaries and automating delivery—(Discover and Implement evidence). However, it lacks thorough financial analysis, structured advice (risk profiles, detailed recommendations), and polished output, so it meets the category only partially rather than the comprehensive standard required for a PASS.",
