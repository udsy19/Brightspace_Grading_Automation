  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial tool: it fetches stock/earnings data (EPS and other metrics) via Alpha Vantage, analyzes weaknesses in plain English, and writes outputs to a spreadsheet. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence show both intent and execution, and REFLECT shows iterative refinement, meeting the criterion for a functioning financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration (OpenAI agent) that processes external data (Alpha Vantage), formats human-readable analyses, and stores outputs (Google Sheets), demonstrating added value beyond superficial use. Implementation details and reflective plans indicate a thorough, working integration consistent with the DRIVER stages.",
