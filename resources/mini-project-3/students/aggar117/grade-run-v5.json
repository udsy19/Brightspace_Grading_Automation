  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working financial tool that performs investment scenario analyses (including risk tolerance and visualizations) and integrates live market data via Yahoo Finance, satisfying the criterion. Implementation evidence (n8n workflows, APIs, Postman) shows the tool functions as a financial application despite minor performance/output issues mentioned.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates substantive, functional AI integration: they moved from a basic V1 to a V2 that uses AI-driven analyses (risk/sentiment) and implemented it via Gemini API within an N8n workflow ingesting live data and JSON inputs. The concrete implementation details and reflection on usefulness indicate AI adds meaningful value rather than being superficial.",
