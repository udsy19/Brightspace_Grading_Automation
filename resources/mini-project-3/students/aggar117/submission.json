  "transcript": "(0:05) All right, so this is my mini project number three. So I did a smart investment scenario (0:09) analysis with different investments.\nSo the main difference in V1 was there was no (0:14) sentiment analysis or risk tolerance analysis. It was simply just time horizon, number of years, (0:22) and required return, basically. And it was a very simple scenario.\nBut then V2 was multi-scenario (0:29) analysis with different scenarios, risk tolerances, and visualizations that we did (0:37) and used different investments in general. So for some reason, when I'm running it, (0:46) it's not running very quickly. But here I have it made on N8n with my four nodes using Gemini API (0:54) key and Yahoo Finance key for live stock data using their API.\nAnd then it's using Postman for (1:05) inputting through raw JSON data, sending it over to N8n where it executed. And then (1:10) here's the summarization. For some reason, the output on here is being translated into JSON (1:19) metadata, so I can't open it.\nBut this is more or less a summarization of what is coming out. (1:25) It's a much more thorough analysis of overall of the scenarios compared to V1. And this one was (1:34) definitely the most advanced project so far.\nRequired a lot more work. Even with AI, it took (1:40) a while. But definitely, this has been the most useful project so far.I definitely could see (1:46) using it in higher classes and even in my future."
