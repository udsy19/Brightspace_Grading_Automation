  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: live price APIs, user-profile-driven AI prompts, and produced risk scores/examples (e.g., Tesla 15/100). The DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Verify) provide coherent evidence that the tool performs financial tasks and tailors output to user context, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows substantive AI integration: real-time data plus explicit injection of user risk/age into AI instructions and demonstrated tailored outputs (different ages, risk profiles, asset examples). DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Verify/Reflect) provide coherent evidence that AI is meaningfully embedded rather than superficial.",
