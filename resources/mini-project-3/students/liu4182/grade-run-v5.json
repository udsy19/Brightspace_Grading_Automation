  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates core financial functionality—risk profiling, portfolio comparisons, and dynamic allocation recommendations (with concrete examples like VOO/QQQ vs BND). Implementation evidence shows the tool runs and returns structured financial outputs, meeting the criterion for a functioning financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI as the core decision engine with concrete, differing behaviors in Simple vs Fancy modes, structured AI outputs, and UI-driven dynamic adjustments—demonstrating effective, value-adding integration (Implement and Reflect). The discussion is specific and substantive rather than superficial, satisfying the PASS standard.",
