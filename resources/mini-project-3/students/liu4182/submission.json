For Mini-Project 3, I built SmartPath AI Risk Analyzer, an intelligent finance tool that helps users understand their investment risk profile and get personalized portfolio suggestions.\nMy tool has two modes — a Simple Mode for beginners and a Fancy Mode for more advanced or interactive users. Both modes use AI as the decision engine, but the experience is tailored to different types of users.\nLet me show you how it works.\n \n🟦 SIMPLE MODE Demo\nFirst, I'll start with Simple Mode.\nThis mode is designed for people who just want quick, clear answers.\nThe input form only asks for three things:\n•\tInvestment amount\n•\tAge\n•\tGoal & timelineWhen I click \"Analyze My Profile,\" the AI generates a structured result.\nIt follows the exact format we defined in the prompt:\n1.\tRisk Profile Summary – A simple explanation of the user's overall risk level\n2.\tKey Factors Identified\n3.\tThree comparison portfolios: Conservative, Balanced, and Aggressive\n4.\tA recommended option with the reasoning behind it\n5.\tPotential risks to avoid\n6.\tA next-step suggestion\n7.\tAnd finally, an educational disclaimer\nThis mode is great for beginners because it is very clean, low-stress, and easy to understand. It teaches users the whybehind each suggestion instead of just giving numbers.\n \n🟪 FANCY MODE Demo\nNow let's look at Fancy Mode, which is more interactive and visually dynamic.\nWhen I switch to Fancy Mode, the form changes.\nInstead of typing numbers, users can adjust:\n•\tA slider for investment amount (from $100 to $50k)\n•\tA slider for risk tolerance (1 to 10)\nThey can still enter age and goal if they want more personalization.After clicking \"Analyze My Profile,\" the output becomes more advanced:\n1.\tIt clearly shows Mode: Fancy (Slider + Suggestion Box)\n2.\tIt gives a risk profile based on the sliders\n3.\tIt generates one optimized portfolio allocation that reacts to risk level\n(for example, higher risk → more VOO/QQQ, lower risk → more BND)\nThen we have the Suggestion Box, which is one of the coolest parts:\n•\tKey Risks\n•\tPersonalized Tips•\t\"What You Might Be Forgetting\"\n•\tNext-Best Action\nFinally, the tool provides a short investment-by-investment suggestion, based exactly on the slider values, which gives the user one specific actionable idea.\nThis mode feels more like a modern fintech app — interactive, personalized, and visually intuitive.\n \n🧠 Behind the Scenes\nBoth modes share the same AI brain, but they run different reasoning paths.\nSimple Mode activates a straightforward reasoning template.\nFancy Mode activates a deeper, UI-aware reasoning structure that uses the slider data to dynamically adjust risk analysis and suggestions.\nThis shows how AI can adapt its reasoning depending on user experience design — which is exactly what this project aims to teach.\n \n🎯 CLOSING\nIn summary, SmartPath AI is not just a calculator.\nIt's an intelligent financial assistant that:\n•\tUnderstands user context\n•\tExplains concepts clearly\n•\tGenerates personalized and responsible guidance\n•\tAnd adapts to two different interface styles\nThis is Version 1 and Version 2 combined into one seamless tool.\nThank you for watching!"
