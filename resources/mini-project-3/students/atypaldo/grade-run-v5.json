  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it collects financial inputs, integrates market data, and generates scenario-based financial plans with numeric outputs (required contributions, future value). The DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Reflect) show conceptual justification, actual implementation (profile memory, JSON), and safety/validation steps, supporting a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates multiple, concrete AI integrations (personalized profile injection, structured JSON outputs, scenario generation and UI parsing) and shows iterative improvement and safety considerations. These specifics across Discover, Implement, and Reflect indicate effective, value-adding AI integration beyond a superficial use.",
