  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student implemented a working financial app that computes NPV, IRR, payback, and scenario sensitivity, and they validated results against an external calculator. Combined with input handling and iterative improvements (Implement, Validate, Evolve), this demonstrates thorough, functioning financial application capabilities.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration that adds analytical and explanatory value (automated NPV/IRR, recommendations, sensitivity scenarios, input parsing and validation) rather than superficial use. Driver stages—Discover, Represent, Implement, Validate, and Evolve—provide evidence of effective, iterative AI incorporation, meeting the PASS threshold.",

        "\"for the validate stage I went ahead and put those same cash flows into a net present value calculator and as we can see here uh the 22,637,185 uh is the same from uh the app. So we can validate it and say that the calculations are correct.\""
