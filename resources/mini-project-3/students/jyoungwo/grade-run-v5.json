  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial application that performs core financial tasks—investment goal calculations, required return estimation, CPI adjustment, and asset-allocation recommendations—with concrete examples (10k→100k over 10 years needing ~26%, 25-year moderate needing ~9.65%). The Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages together demonstrate both functionality and applied financial reasoning, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates an AI model into the workflow (user action -> AI processing -> synthesized output), but the treatment is high-level and lacks detail on how the AI adds substantive, novel value or the specific techniques used. Given correct but brief evidence of integration across DRIVER stages, this meets a partial (conceptual) demonstration rather than the thorough, detailed treatment required for a full pass.",
