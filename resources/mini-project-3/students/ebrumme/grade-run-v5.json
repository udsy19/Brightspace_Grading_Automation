  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application that performs core financial tasks (loan entry, repayment-plan generation, payoff dates, and interest comparisons) with concrete numeric output, showing both conceptual and applied functionality (Discover + Implement). The added credit-score feature and validation steps further support a complete, working financial tool, meeting PASS-level thoroughness.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates clear, effective AI integration: they used Google AI Studio to implement an AI advisor that decomposes goals, generates repayment strategies, and produces specific numeric outputs (months, interest saved). The presence of implementation details, example outputs, and an evolved feature (credit-score impact) show thorough, functional use of AI rather than superficial mention.",
