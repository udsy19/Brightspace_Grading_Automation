  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working AI finance tool that retrieves stock data, computes risk metrics, generates forecasts, and gives suitability recommendations (Implement evidence). The student framed a clear financial decision (Discover) and validated results against Yahoo Finance while reflecting on limitations (Reflect), showing functional and appropriate financial application behavior.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration: a concrete implementation in Google AI Studio that generates forecasts, risk assessments, and alternative recommendations, plus verification and prompt iteration. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages demonstrates the AI is meaningfully embedded and adds value beyond superficial use.",

Based on your risk profile, Google um is likely not a good fit. Um the current price is 320.8. So the analysis um shows a little bit of why um a little bit about the dividend yield, the beta, um the stock's performance in the last few years, and then just gives like just a little description on the stock's behavior.\"",
