  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements financial functionality (budget calculation, risk scenarios, and AI advice) and shows example runs with concrete outputs, satisfying the criterion that the tool works and performs financial tasks. The Discover and Implement stages provide direct evidence of purpose and functioning.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (API key, AI-generated advice, example runs) and the AI adds tangible value (actionable recommendations), but the treatment is basic and superficial with no discussion of prompts, model selection, or validation. Given correct but limited integration, PARTIAL is appropriate.",
