  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective AI integration: natural-language interpretation, use of AI to call domain-specific calculators as tools, and generation of scenario-based recommendations with explanations (implemented and shown in a run). The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) provide coherent evidence of purposeful, functional, and responsible AI integration, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it computes PV/FV/COC, integrates those functions into an AI-driven decision workflow, and outputs a concrete NPV-like result with recommendation. DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT evidence shows intent and functioning components, and REFLECT confirms the tool produces actionable financial analysis.",
