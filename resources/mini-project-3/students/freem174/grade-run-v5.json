  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a functioning financial application: live demo generating stock charts, external data integration, technical indicator image analysis, and contextual explanations tailored to user risk/time horizon. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence plus REFLECT commentary together demonstrate thorough, working financial app functionality, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission provides detailed, concrete examples of AI components (NLU for intent extraction, memory for risk/horizon, image-analysis for technical indicators) and explains their orchestration in a multi-step workflow, with implementation and testing described. This thorough, specific treatment demonstrates effective AI integration beyond superficial use, satisfying PASS.",
