How I designed the tool\n0:26\ndiscover the problem I wanted to solve\n0:27\nis most people don't understand what a\n0:29\nstock chart is telling them. They can\n0:31\nlook up a price, but they can't answer.\n0:33\nIs this chart trending up or down? Does\n0:35\nRSI or MACD mean for me? Is the stock\n0:39\nappropriate for my risk level? So, my\n0:41\ngoal was to build a tool that not only\n0:42\ncreates charts, but also explains the\n0:44\nstock in simple terms based on the\n0:46\nuser's goals, risk tolerance, and time\n0:48\nhorizon.\n0:50\nReason AI adds intelligence through\n0:54\nnatural language understanding. Learners\n0:55\ncan message the bot and Telegram.\n0:57\nAnalyze Tesla for me. Give me a chart of\n0:59\nApple and tell me what it means. The AI\n1:01\nextracts the ticker interval, user\n1:03\nintent, and context.\n1:06\nMemory. In the workflow, I added a\n1:08\nsimple memory node so that the bot can\n1:10\nremember previous user inputs like if\n1:12\nthe user said they're moderate risk or\n1:14\nlooking at a 5-year horizon. Multi-step\n1:17\nreasoning. My workflow splits into a\n1:19\nchart generated step, an image analysis\n1:21\nstep, and a financial explanation step.\n1:24\nThis lets the AI look at the chart\n1:26\nvisually and then interpret the\n1:27\nindicators implement. This is where the\n1:30\nworkflow comes in particular.\n1:34\nSo, as you can see here, I have\n1:37\neverything laid out. Stock request. So,\n1:39\nthis is where the message comes in from\n1:40\nTelegram and it comes over to the chat\n1:42\nbox. Down here is the AI that we have\n1:44\nlinked to read and answer the questions.\n1:47\nThe memor is recalling what was asked\n1:49\nwhen we proceed on with more\n1:51\ninformation.\n1:53\nAnd this is pulling in the get chart\n1:55\ndata. I had an issue trying to get that\n1:57\nsubflow. So I ended up just pasting it\n1:59\nin here as well and just splitting into\n2:01\ntwo branches. But this will generate the\n2:04\nmessage um and I have like the tasks\n2:06\neverything written within them and then\n2:08\nit will respond to the message that was\n2:11\nsent in telegram and then this process\n2:15\nhere is for creating the chart and\n2:17\nanalyzing. So let's start with Microsoft\n2:22\nand this is kind of what I've been\n2:23\ntrying to do more specifically is I'm\n2:27\nmoderate risk. Oh wait now I'm on\n2:31\nTelegram. Sorry, I wasn't sharing my\n2:32\ntime. I'm moderate risk and am\n2:36\ninterested in micro\n2:40\nsoft stock. What should I know?\n2:47\nAnd we have to execute the workflow\n2:49\nhere.\n2:51\nAnd as you can see now,\n2:55\nit's going to load on over and go\n2:58\nthrough all of this.\n3:02\nAnd it um here we go.\n3:07\nHere's Microsoft. It's coming through.\n3:09\nLet me write over comprehensive\n3:11\nanalysis. And it's giving me all the\n3:12\ninformation on here.\n3:15\nCloud computing\n3:18\nall the things. So, it's just continuing\n3:20\nto give me all the information I need.\n3:23\nAnd then also as well here has what the\n3:25\nMicrosoft stock looks like. And then I\n3:28\ncould re ask, hey, can you explain for\n3:30\nme what this stock means?\n3:33\nWhat does this chart mean\n3:38\nin relation\n3:41\nto Sorry, my spelling is not good right\n3:44\nnow. I'm just kind of typing fast. Um,\n3:47\nbut anyways, it'll keep doing that. But\n3:49\nwhile that's loading, let's go back over\n3:52\nhere. Um, so section one is the user\n3:56\nmessage bot. kind of like I went over\n3:58\nalready the telegrammer. So that's the\n4:01\nmessaging system. Then the second part\n4:03\nis the AI understanding with Claude and\n4:08\nanthropic which is just an AI um method.\n4:12\nAnd then that extracts the ticker\n4:14\ninterval risk tolerance goals any text\n4:16\nanalysis request. So like what I just\n4:18\npunched through. Um then this third\n4:21\nsection is the chart the chart\n4:22\ngeneration pipeline which is where um\n4:26\nyou're able to see the downloaded chart\n4:28\nwhich shows the external data\n4:30\nintegration structured real-time output\n4:32\nand multi-step tool use. And then this\n4:36\nis one of the coolest features is the\n4:37\nimage analysis AI. Um and it reads the\n4:40\nchart itself. So the analyze image\n4:43\nbreaks down the trend directions, RSI\n4:46\noversold, bot signals, MACD crossover,\n4:50\nsupport resistance zones, whether the\n4:51\njar is bullish or bearish.\n4:55\nAnd then I have to hit execute workflow.\n4:58\nI forgot to say that, but it's going to\n5:02\ngo ahead and do um that. And then the\n5:05\nsection five was spinning final results\n5:07\nback to the telegram. So that's where\n5:09\nthe chart goes back in the chat. A text\n5:11\ninterpretation of the stock key\n5:13\nhighlights and warnings. Everything is\n5:16\nreturned inside Telegram using send a\n5:18\nsend a text message. And as you can see\n5:21\nhere,\n5:22\nit's going to come through.\n5:28\nIt'll take just a second, but Oh, there\n5:31\nit comes.\n5:36\nSo, it's giving a breakdown of\n5:38\neverything that we're seeing there in\n5:40\nthat chart.\n5:44\nWe'll jump back here.\n5:46\nOh my gosh,\n5:49\ngetting blown up. But our last few\n5:52\nthings and the driver is verify. So I\n5:56\ntested multiple socks and scenarios to\n5:58\nensure that the ticker formatting\n6:00\nworked. The API chart always return a\n6:02\nvalid image and a explanations adjust\n6:06\nfor different risk levels. Air handling\n6:08\nprevents invalid recommendations.\n6:11\nUm I had invalid symbols earlier and I\n6:15\nfixed this by cleaning up tickers and\n6:16\nvalidating them before calling the API.\n6:19\nEvolve my version one bot only generated\n6:22\ncharts and the version two now which you\n6:24\nsee adds in image based technical\n6:26\ntechnical analysis stock summary\n6:28\nintelligence user memory clean telegram\n6:31\nresponse flow multi-step AI reasoning\n6:34\nstructured explanations and real chart\n6:36\nAPI integrations\n6:38\nmoving forward some of my future ideas\n6:40\nwould be scenario comparison so\n6:42\ncomparing two different stocks portfolio\n6:45\nlevel analysis and adding news sentiment\n6:50\nReflecting on this, this project made me\n6:52\nrealize that building with A isn't about\n6:53\nreplacing code. It's about designing\n6:55\nworkflows where AI interprets the users,\n6:58\na tool fetches real data, another AI\n7:00\ninterprets the data, and the system\n7:02\nmerges everything into something\n7:04\nmeaningful. It's not just calculate X.\n7:07\nIt's help me understand this in a way I\n7:09\ncan actually use. My sock analysis bot\n7:12\ndoes exactly that. transforms charts,\n7:14\nindicators, and financial data into\n7:16\nsomething normal people can actually\n7:17\nunderstand. Thank you for watching, and\n7:20\nthis is my intelligence intelligent\n7:22\nstock analysis and chart box built in\n7:24\nNAN and powered by AI and real financial\n7:27\ndata."
