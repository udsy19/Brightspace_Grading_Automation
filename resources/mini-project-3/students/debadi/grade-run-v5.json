  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it ingests a user profile, fetches live market data, produces portfolio allocations and explanations, and formats outputs for users. Evidence from Discover and Implement stages shows both intent and concrete implementation; Reflect confirms appropriate financial framing and safeguards, supporting a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates substantive, functional AI integration: a GN/T model (GBT4) is fed engineered prompts plus live market data and returns structured analyses parsed into tables. Implementation details (API keys, Alpha Vantage, parsing AI JSON) and reflective discussion of limitations show more than a superficial use, satisfying the PASS criteria.",
