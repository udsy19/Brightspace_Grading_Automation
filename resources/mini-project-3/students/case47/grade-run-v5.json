  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a working financial application: it generates multi-scenario investment outputs, performs compound-interest calculations, and writes structured results to Google Sheets (demoed and supported by implemented code). The Discover and Implement stages provide concrete evidence of functionality and calculation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI components (an agent that produces bear/base/bull scenarios, structured JSON output parsing, automated sheet ingestion, and a compound-interest calculator) and documented implementation details and iteration. Use of Gemini to generate parser code and explicit pipeline descriptions show substantive, functional AI integration beyond superficial use.",
