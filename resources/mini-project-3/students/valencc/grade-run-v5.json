  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and implements financial application functionality (data extraction of incomes/debt/goals, calculations for months-to-goal, scenario comparisons, and feasibility checks), meeting the criterion. Discovery and Implementation evidence show both conceptual design and concrete financial processing, supporting a full PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes multiple, specific AI roles (NLU to extract structured inputs, integration with programmatic scenario calculations, and AI-generated explanations) that add clear user value beyond a superficial use. The Discover and Implement evidence demonstrates an integrated AI-enabled pipeline, meeting the criterion for effective AI integration.",
