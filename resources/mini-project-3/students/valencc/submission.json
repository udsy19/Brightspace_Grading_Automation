The goal wasn't just to\ncalculate numbers but to help users\nactually understand their financial\ndecisions. So AI acts as the brain and\nnot just the calculator.\nUm so this flow begins with a chat UI\ntrigger uh open here where the user\nenters a situation in natural language.\nStep two uses AI to extract structured\ndata, incomes, savings, debt, goal,\ntimeline, and risk tolerance into a\nclean JSON format. Step three then\nparses that JSON and add default values\nin a month to goal calculation. Step\nfour uses code to run real financial map\num through scenarios. Conservative\nbalance aggressive required monthly\nsaving a feasibility check based on\nincome and guard rails are key info like\ngoal amount is missing. tool numbers.\nStep five, use AI again, but this time\nto explain the results in a clear\neducational way understand.\nAnd here now we'll uh be doing a live\ndemo. Um so here is an input that\nincludes all the information required.\nAnd here's a response from um\noverall\nuh number one your situation\nand then scenario comparison\nrecommendation\nand then risk and disclaimer.\nUm and then here is Our\nsecond live demo.\nAnd it goes again here\nchat there's a situation scenario\ncomparison\num the recommendation\nand\nso\num by combining accurate financial logic\nwith AI explanation\nThis tool helps users understand not\njust what they should do but why. Um is\neducational only with disclaimers\nincluded at the end which builds trust\nand responsible AI use into the design.Thank you."
