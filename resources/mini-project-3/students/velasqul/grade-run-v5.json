You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a functioning financial tool that analyzes investments (Discover), provides implementation details showing it integrates real financial data and structured outputs (Implement), and reflects on utility and safety (Reflect). These combined evidences demonstrate a thorough, working financial application, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates substantive, multi-faceted AI integration (persona modeling, structured output, RAG with real financial data) and describes technical implementation and safety measures, satisfying thorough treatment for a PASS.",
