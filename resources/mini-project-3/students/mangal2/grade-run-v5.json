  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application that fetches stock prices, news/sentiment, generates structured investment theses, visualizations, and runs as a full-stack app (Implement evidence). The Discover and Reflect stages show purpose and appropriate limitations, supporting a PASS for functioning as a financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates substantive, functional AI integration: a multi-step pipeline using Gemini + live search, structured JSON outputs, sentiment parsing, and visualization—supported by concrete examples (Bitcoin, Apple vs Microsoft) and implementation details. The student also reflected on the tool's value and limits, indicating mature integration rather than superficial use.",
