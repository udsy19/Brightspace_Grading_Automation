  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application that computes key capital-budgeting metrics (NPV/IRR/payback) and produces contextualized explanations, satisfying the criterion. Implementation evidence (code/Streamlit, computed metrics, structured prompts) shows the tool functions as a financial app rather than being purely conceptual.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI beyond a superficial call — they structured prompts with computed metrics and user context, produced multi-part, personalized outputs, and implemented it in a working Streamlit app. Discover and Implement evidence shows purposeful design and functioning AI integration, meeting the criterion for effective AI use.",
