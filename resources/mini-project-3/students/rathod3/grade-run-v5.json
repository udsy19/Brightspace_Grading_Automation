You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: inputs for capital budgeting, computed outputs (NPV, IRR, payback, cash flows), and an automated recommendation based on a defined decision rule. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence confirm both intent and functional implementation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete, functional AI integration: a prompt-engineered model produces analysis and recommendations based on user inputs and encoded decision rules, and the app updates outputs when inputs change. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence shows the AI adds real analytical value beyond superficial use.",
