  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it accepts user inputs, produces concrete investment strategies (e.g., 60/40 allocation), and includes verification and risk-warning features. Discover and Implement stages provide clear goal, inputs, workflow, and outputs, showing thorough, working financial functionality consistent with a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates substantive, functional AI integration—building an AI agent with memory, providing concrete prompts and outputs (personalized strategies and trade-offs), and implementing safety behaviors—meeting the PASS standard. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows both design intent and working implementation.",
