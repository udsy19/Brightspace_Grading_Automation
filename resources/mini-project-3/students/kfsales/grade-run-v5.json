You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a working tool focused on financial decisions (salary negotiations), generates actionable outputs (scripts, risk labels), and logs interactions—evidence of functioning financial application. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages show problem definition and concrete execution; REFLECT confirms the tool's intended financial use and completeness.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a substantive, multi-component AI integration (model + memory + logging + roleplay + risk labeling) that adds clear user value and safety considerations. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence demonstrate both intent and concrete execution, and REFLECT confirms meaningful benefit, meeting the PASS standard.",
