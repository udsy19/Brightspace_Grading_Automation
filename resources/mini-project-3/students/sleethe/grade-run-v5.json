  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working financial application: it ingests income/expenses/goals, uses AI to identify surplus and generate personalized recommendations, and integrates external financial data. Implementation details and the demo output demonstrate functional financial-task performance, and reflection highlights practical safeguards, so the criterion is satisfied.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a clear, functional AI integration: prompts sent to OpenAI for interpretation and recommendation, merging with external data, and producing validated structured outputs. The described implementation and reflective loops show the AI adds substantive value (reasoning, personalization, safety), meeting the criterion.",
