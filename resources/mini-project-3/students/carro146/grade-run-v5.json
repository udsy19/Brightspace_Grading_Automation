  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student shows a complete, working financial workflow: structured intake, deterministic math computing future-value scenarios (3 rates), sanity checks, and an explanatory output—meeting the criterion that the tool functions as a financial application. The DRIVER implement and reflect stages provide concrete evidence of calculations, robustness, and design decisions.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a clear, multi-node architecture where AI is used appropriately for natural-language parsing and user-facing explanations while deterministic code performs calculations and sanity checks. That separation, plus integration of external data and a final AI explainer, demonstrates effective AI integration that adds value rather than superficial use.",
