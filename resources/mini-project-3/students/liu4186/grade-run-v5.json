  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a functioning financial application: it defines purpose and inputs, computes cash flows and key metrics (NPV, IRR, payback), validates the math, and provides a concrete coffee‑shop scenario with numeric outputs. These elements meet the criterion for a working financial tool at a thorough, application-oriented level.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly uses Google AI Studio and a model to generate scenario outputs and personalized explanations, demonstrating AI integration. However, the evidence suggests the work is primarily deterministic calculation plus generated text rather than deeper AI capabilities (e.g., learned predictions, probabilistic modeling, or novel ML-driven insights), so the integration is correct but not demonstrated in depth — therefore PARTIAL.",
