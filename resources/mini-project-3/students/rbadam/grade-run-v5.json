  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows concrete financial outputs (NPV, IRR, payback) across multiple case studies and describes an implemented front-end/backend pipeline using AI, indicating the tool functions as a financial application. Driver stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) corroborate both the intent and working implementation, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration (Gemini + n8n) that produces analyst reasoning and interprets NPV/IRR results across multiple case studies, demonstrating added value beyond surface automation. The DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages support a thorough, applied integration—meeting PASS criteria.",
