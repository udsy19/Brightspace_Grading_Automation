  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly demonstrates a functioning financial application that accepts savings/income inputs, uses market data, and produces asset-allocation and return estimates (Discover + Implement evidence). The Reflect stage further shows awareness of limits and appropriate caution, supporting that the tool operates as a financial app while acknowledging constraints.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration (real-time market data, AI-driven recommendation generation, and a memory state) and gives multiple examples (V1 vs V2 improvements and workflow execution). The student also reflects on benefits and limitations, indicating a robust, applied understanding that meets the PASS standard.",
