Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student both specified a financial analysis task and demonstrated an implemented app that computes core financial metrics and generates an investment report. The IMPLEMENT evidence (metrics, graph, report) shows the tool performs financial tasks, meeting the criterion for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration: a crafted prompt defining the AI analyst role, use of Google AI Studio to deploy an app, and generation of substantive outputs (NPV, IRR, terminal value, graphs, and written report sections). This demonstrates effective, value-adding AI integration rather than a superficial mention.",
