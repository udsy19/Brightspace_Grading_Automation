So first I begin with writing a prompt to send into the Google AI studio and this is my prompt, our instructions, our dynamic which is you're an expert AI investment analyst writing a formal business report for corporate finance committee, your tone must be intuitive, clear, and professional, and then our dynamic input data which has all of the project parameters, and then the task to generate a detailed report addressing the project's viability, risks, strategic alignment. \n\nThe final output must include four distinct sections formatted with bold headings ensuring that all recorded elements are below and incorporated. So we have our project recommendation, our key risk factors, strategic alignment, and then the executive summary as well. And then we have our final output formatting note. So do not include the system instruction or dynamic input data section for our final input only deliver our four report sections. \nSo then I sent this through Google AI Studio and they went ahead and provided me with a quick app. So here we can change the capital index fund, we can change the working capital as well, we have our operating metrics and our growth profile as well, and it presents me with the financial metrics, the net present value, the internal rate of return, the terminal value, and here we have a graph as well for our cash flow projections, and then our AI investment report, which includes our recommendation, our main accepted decline, risk factors, a strategic fit, long-term market value commitment, market expansion penetration, future value generation, and then lastly our conclusion as well. Thank you!"
