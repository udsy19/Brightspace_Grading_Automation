You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student describes a functioning financial application with specific financial inputs and multiple outputs (charts, cashflow strategy, allocation, monthly savings) and an implemented N8N tool. Given the concrete examples and claimed validation, this meets the moderate requirement for a thorough, working financial app.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates correct and concrete integration of AI at a conceptual level (tool built with AI, produces analyses and charts) but provides limited technical detail about how AI is used or what capabilities it performs, so the integration is clear but not thoroughly documented. Under the MODERATE standard, this shows valid understanding but lacks the depth/explicit examples required for a full PASS.",
