  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it ingests stock tickers, compiles data/news/metrics, and produces buy/hold recommendations with confidence — meeting the criterion that the tool performs financial tasks. Implementation and reflection remarks confirm the app is built and actively working (with occasional tweaks), so PASS is warranted.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates substantive AI integration: the app uses Google AI Studio to generate buy/sell recommendations, confidence scores, and AI-generated theses/summaries that inform users. The student produced a working prototype (with noted tweaks needed) and reflected on its usefulness, meeting the standards for a thorough, applied integration.",
