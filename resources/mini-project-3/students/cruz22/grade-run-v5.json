  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it monitors multiple stocks (20), fetches price updates, and sends email alerts (implementation with API keys). The student also reflects on volatility and investment horizon, showing both practical operation and financial interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI components (AI builder, OpenAI/Gemini APIs) into the tool and used them to produce actionable outputs (email alerts with long-term investment recommendations). The DRIVER stages (Discover–Implement–Reflect) show the AI was purposefully incorporated and evaluated, meeting the criterion that AI integration adds value.",
