  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: deterministic financial calculations run locally, AI provides context-aware strategy, and the student validated outputs with multiple scenarios and guardrails. These concrete implementation and testing steps meet the criterion for a functioning financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a clear, working integration of AI as the strategic reasoning layer (Gemini) while keeping calculations deterministic and adding guardrails and testing—demonstrating effective, practical AI integration. The DRIVER stages (Discover→Implement→Reflect) provide coherent evidence of design, implementation, and validation, meeting the PASS standard.",
