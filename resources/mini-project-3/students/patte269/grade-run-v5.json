  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application concept and a concrete example, showing basic functionality (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT). However, it lacks detailed calculations, multiple use cases, or in-depth explanation of methods or outputs (REFLECT), so the evidence supports a correct but basic treatment rather than a thorough one.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (claims use of GPT-4 mini) and provides a sample scenario, so it is not a fail. However, it lacks detailed description of how AI is used, concrete outputs, technical integration details, or multiple examples needed for a thorough PASS, so the work is assessed as PARTIAL.",
