You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows the tool retrieves and populates financial metrics (price, market cap, P/E, EPS, debt, cash, revenue growth) for a ticker into Google Sheets and the student confirmed it now works after debugging. This satisfies the criterion that the tool functions as a financial application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrates AI into a workflow that adds value (automating retrieval/summary of stock metrics) and demonstrates implementation and outputs, but treatment is basic and conceptual—lacking depth about the AI's capabilities, validation, or advanced integration—so it meets a partial (correct but not thorough) standard.",
