  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a functioning financial application: it defines the use case, implements core financial math (TVM/future-value annuity and required rate), integrates external market data, and outlines AI-driven explanations. Given the documented implementation details and alignment across DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT, the work meets the criterion for a financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes specific, actionable AI integration (OpenAI API calls, structured JSON, controlled system prompts) and demonstrates how AI adds value (plain-English explanations, scenario comparisons, contextualization). Combined with safety measures and reflective rationale, this meets the threshold for a thorough, effective AI integration.",

IMPLEMENT — described technical implementation: Python script, TVM formula, required-rate calculation, external API for risk-free rate, JSON packaging and AI integration. REFLECT — positioned the tool as an educational financial application and noted core financial concepts (TVM, risk tolerance, diversification).",
