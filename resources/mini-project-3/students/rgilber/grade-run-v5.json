  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides multiple concrete financial examples (calculations, savings projections, buy-vs-lease and investment allocation advice) and shows both stateless and stateful implementations, meeting the category's expectation that the tool functions as a financial application. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) collectively demonstrate clear purpose, executed functionality, and reflective improvement consistent with a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective AI integration through a described architecture (OpenAI node, memory node, prompt logic) and multiple concrete examples showing value beyond superficial outputs (contextual, stateful advice). Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages provide coherent evidence that AI meaningfully adds capability, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.",
