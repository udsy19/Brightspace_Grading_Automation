  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working financial application: it computes commissions, handles multi-currency conversion, applies discount penalties, and provides optimization output and templates. The Implement and Reflect stages provide concrete functional details and an example scenario, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes concrete AI functions (NL input parsing, data extraction, currency conversion, commission math) and value-added features (cliff detection, optimization strategies, email templates), showing effective integration rather than superficial use. Discover/Implement/Reflect statements collectively demonstrate a strong, applied AI integration.",
