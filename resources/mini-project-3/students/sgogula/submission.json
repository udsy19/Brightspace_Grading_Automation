My tool is called the gold based\n0:17\ninvestment scenario advisor. It helps\n0:19\nusers understand financial decisions and\n0:22\nnot just calculate them. So what the\n0:24\ntool does is that instead of asking\n0:26\nusers for numbers in the form, the tool\n0:28\naccepts natural language. So for\n0:31\nexample, I can say something like I'm\n0:35\nfor example right here, I'm 25, have\n0:37\n$5,000 saved, can add $300 a month, want\n0:40\nto buy a house in 5 years, medium risk.\n0:43\nSo this can understand semantic values\n0:46\nas it's tied to, you know, open AI on\n0:51\nkey. So when I hit my scenario, it gives\n0:54\nme two options. I can export the results\n0:56\nas a PDF and it also shows me my\n0:59\nscenarios from before. gives me a\n1:02\nsummary of the uh data I entered\n1:06\nand it divides my investment options\n1:09\ninto conservative, balanced and\n1:10\naggressive and shows the uh projected\n1:13\ngrowth over time for all of them and\n1:15\nthen adds up the total contributions as\n1:17\nwell and then compares the three\n1:19\nscenarios conservative, balanced and\n1:21\naggressive with the return rates as\n1:24\ngiven and it also gives you pros and\n1:27\ncons of each and then it creates an\n1:29\nrecommendation. So I said that based on\n1:31\nyour moderate risk tolerance and\n1:32\nmedium-term balanced approach may be the\n1:35\nmost suitable for your situation, your\n1:37\nmedium-term timeline allows for some\n1:39\ngrowth while still being mindful of what\n1:41\nit's losing. Consider your personal\n1:43\ncomfort level with seeing your account\n1:45\nfluctuate when making your final\n1:47\ndecision. And it also shows some risks\n1:50\nand limitations such as past performance\n1:53\ndoes not guarantee future results, tax\n1:55\nimplications are not considered etc. And\n1:58\nit also says in the end this tool is\n1:59\nused for education use only and not\n2:02\nfinancial advice.\n2:06\nSo um in my version one the only general\n2:11\nfinancial advice and sometimes\n2:13\nhallucinated number and such as I\n2:16\ncouldn't get it to link to my open AI.\n2:19\nSo it would just take it would just take\n2:21\nit in format of like blocks instead of\n2:25\nany semantic text. And in version two I\n2:28\nadded structure JSON outputs which\n2:30\neliminated the hallucinated values.\n2:32\nIntern ex external data integration\n2:34\nwhich is basically if I give a sentence\n2:38\nit will take the values it needs from it\n2:40\nfrom a real API. Sanity checks for\n2:43\nunrealistic inputs. explicit disclaimers\n2:46\nand risk warning and a most stable and\n2:48\nsafety focused system.\n2:51\nSo this tool is useful because it gives\n2:53\nusers something calculators don't\n2:55\ncontextual financial insight. So it\n2:58\ngives you the values but it also\n2:59\nexplains what these values are\n3:03\nand this tool when I was building it\n3:06\nmade me think a lot about the ethics of\n3:07\nAI and finance. So models can be\n3:10\npersuasive. So I built guard trails to\n3:12\nprevent harmful advice such as no stock\n3:14\npicking, no guaranteed returns, risk\n3:17\ndisclosures like such as that last\n3:19\nsentence said that um this is only for\n3:24\neducational use and is not financial\n3:26\nadvice. So that is our subject. Thank\n3:28\nyou."
