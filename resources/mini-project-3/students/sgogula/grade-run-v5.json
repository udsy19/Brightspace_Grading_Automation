  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built a working financial application that accepts natural-language scenarios, computes and compares investment projections, and produces recommendations and exports. Implementation evidence (JSON outputs, data integration, sanity checks) shows the tool performs financial tasks reliably, and reflective work indicates appropriate safeguards.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates multiple concrete AI integrations (NL parsing, OpenAI connectivity, structured outputs to prevent hallucination) and explains both technical (JSON, API) and ethical measures (guardrails). These specifics across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages show AI adds clear functional value, meeting the PASS standard.",
