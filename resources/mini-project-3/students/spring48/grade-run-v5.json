  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial app that produces concrete financial calculations (affordability, payment breakdown, payoff timing) and underwent implementation work (bug fixes, data persistence). Although the student reports some inconsistencies, the tool clearly performs relevant financial tasks and multiple example outputs, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (Gemini) to generate functionality, fix code, and produce concrete financial outputs (e.g., affordability calculation), and the student iteratively improved the tool (IMPLEMENT and REFLECT). Although some inconsistency was noted, the AI integration added substantive capability (conversation memory, persistence, calculations), meeting the standard for a PASS.",
