  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working financial application pipeline—data retrieval, model verification, computation, and recommendation display—and provides an example use case (house purchase). Under the MODERATE standard, this conceptual and implementation-level evidence demonstrates the tool performs financial tasks, satisfying PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI components (data fetch, verification, information extraction, model-based computation) and shows they add user value, meeting basic integration expectations. However, the treatment is conceptual and lacks technical depth, quantitative evaluation, or multiple detailed examples required for a full PASS, so PARTIAL is appropriate.",
