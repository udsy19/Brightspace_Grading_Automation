  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it ingests savings/goal/timeframe, performs gap analysis and monthly contribution math, produces portfolio allocations and expected returns, and emails a personalized investment guide. Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows both the tool's financial logic and verified outputs, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates a working AI integration (uses OpenAI chat model and calculator) that produces specific, value-adding outputs (detailed allocations and rationale). Discover, Implement, and Reflect evidence shows the AI component is central, functional, and validated, meeting the criterion for effective AI integration.",
