  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial app: they implemented a generator that computes investment allocations, expected returns, monthly savings targets, and sends a personalized email (Implement + Verify). The Discover and Reflect stages show clear financial intent and iterative validation, supporting a PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates a functioning AI integration (OpenAI model + calculator + automated email) that produces concrete, actionable outputs (specific allocations and expected returns) and adjusts strategy by horizon—evidence of effective integration. Reflection on iterative tweaking and limitations shows understanding of how the AI component was developed and can be improved, meeting the standards for a thorough PASS.",
