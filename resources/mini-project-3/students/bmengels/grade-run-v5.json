  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows the tool ingests financial inputs, fetches market data (10-year treasury yield), runs scenario generation and a recommendation engine, and produces justified recommendations for a concrete user case. These implementation details and the example demonstrate the tool functions as a financial application, satisfying the PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows purposeful AI integration (explicit model use, prompt engineering, multi-step pipeline, external data and guardrails) and a concrete example run, demonstrating that AI adds functional value rather than being superficial. The Discover and Implement evidence together indicate a strong, applied integration consistent with PASS.",
