  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes concrete, functioning financial-app features (personal profile, dashboard with Financial Health Score, AI Chat Advisor, Scenario Comparison) and reports validation with real-life scenarios, demonstrating a working financial application. DRIVER stages (Discover→Reason→Implement→Reflect) provide coherent evidence of design, implementation, and testing, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows multiple concrete AI integrations (context-aware chat, multi-step scenario comparisons, external data, persistent profiles, structured outputs) and validation testing, not just superficial mentions. Combined with DRIVER-stage discussion of design, implementation, and reflection on prompts/guardrails, this meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.",
