  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial tool with multiple simulation models and concrete example outputs, and the student validated calculations manually. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) provide consistent evidence of design, implementation, and verification, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student describes multiple, concrete AI features (Q&A system, three simulators) where the AI produces calculations plus contextual explanations and recommendations, and they validated outputs—showing effective, value-adding integration. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear intent and concrete implementations, with reflection confirming validation and iteration.",
