  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial app: it collects user inputs, integrates external market data, and generates context-aware recommendations (aggressive vs conservative scenarios) with rationale. Implementation and reflection evidence show both the tool was built and responsibly assessed, meeting the criterion for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive AI integration: real-time external data via a search extension, enforced multi-step reasoning, and structured, contextualized recommendations across tested scenarios. These points—documented in the Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages—demonstrate a thorough, effective integration beyond superficial use, meeting PASS standards.",
