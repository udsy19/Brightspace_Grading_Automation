  "transcript": "Hello my name is Clara Weinzapfel, and today I'm going to be going over mini\nproject 3, which is building an advanced\nAI finance tool. And the platform I used\nwas Google AI Studio. I started by\nreading through the assignment on the\ntextbook. And then I copy and pasted the\nassignment instructions into Google\nGemini where I had it walk me through\nhow to use Google AI Studio and build me\na prompt to put into the box.\nafter I um started to build the tool.\nThis tool goes beyond simple\ncalculations. Its goal is to provide\ncontextual personalized financial advice\nby answering the why, not just the what\nof a financial decision. I built this\nusing the Google AI Studio Build\nfeature, like I said, which allows us to\nquickly define the logic and required\ninputs of an advanced AI system.\nSo you can see in the script that I used\non the side,\nthis is the logic that I used which\nintegrates two key advanced capabilities\nrequired by the assignment.\nThe prompt forces a multi-step reasoning\nprocess. The AI must first gather data,\nthen perform contextual analysis based\non the user's profile, and finally\ngenerate a structured recommendation.\nAs you can see here,\nthis ensures the advice is deep and not\njust surface level. I also enabled the\nGoogle search extension. This meets the\nrequirement for external data\nintegration, forcing AI to look up\ncurrent market rates and news before\ngiving advice, making the output\nevidence-based.\nAnd finally, the prompt requires a\nstructured output with clear separate\nsections for analysis, rationale, and\nrecommendation, ensuring the output is\neasy to consume.\nSo now we can see the tool in action\nwith our first scenario, the aggressive\ninvestor. Before doing so, you can see\nthe last test that I did gives an\nanalysis summary, a rationale,\na risk adjusted recommendation,\nand a 10ear growth projection as well as\nthe sources used. So, we can go back up\nto the top and click new analysis.\nAnd here is the data driven financial\nplanning.\nWe use real-time market search data to\nanalyze your goals against current\neconomic conditions to give you a\npersonalized strategy. So to start your\nstrategy,\nour user is going to be 28 years old. So\nwe can put that number here in the age\nbox and with an aggressive risk\ntolerance, which we can adjust here.\nThey also want to invest $5,000 for\nlong-term growth. So we will type that\nin here. I want to invest $5,000\nfor longterm\ngrowth.\nThe AI run searches the market and\nprovides this analysis once we generate\nthe strategy with this button here.\nAnd notice the rationale section. Once\nit loads, it confirms that based on the\naggressive risk and longtime horizon,\nthey should prioritize high growth\nassets like a tech ETF. It answers why.\nNow for the required iteration and to\ndemonstrate context, what if the user\nwas conservative? The analysis\ncompletely shifts. If we are to change\nthat setting, it would now recommend\nconservative options such as diversified\nindex funds or treasury bonds\nprioritizing capital\npreservation over high growth. This\nproves the tool is genuinely intelligent\nand context aware.\nAnd finally, in the safety and trust\nsection, we have\na clear disclaimer. This is a critical\nsanity check and addresses the ethical\nconsideration of preventing harmful\nadvice.\nTo conclude, the hardest part was\nfinancial prompt engineering to enforce\nboth the multi-step logic and a perfect\nJSON structure. This AI transforms the\nuser experience from a static calculator\nto a dynamic dynamic adviser. And\nfinally, would I trust it with real\nmoney? No. But I would trust it to give\nme an intelligent evidence-based\nstarting strategy before speaking to ahuman professional. Thank you."
