You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student built and demonstrated a working car-purchase financial tool that computes APR-based affordability scores and location/currency-aware recommendations with multiple example inputs. DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Verify/Reflect) show both conceptual design and concrete implementation/testing, meeting the standard for a passing financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI as the core decision-making engine (multiple example evaluations, country-specific APRs, scoring), used AI in implementation, and demonstrated reflective verification of AI outputs. While they noted and corrected inaccuracies, the integration is substantive and adds real value, meeting the PASS standard.",
