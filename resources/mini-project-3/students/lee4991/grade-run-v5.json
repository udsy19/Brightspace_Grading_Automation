  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The student describes a financial model that calculates minima/maxima and provides investment recommendations, indicating the tool performs financial tasks. However, repeated notes that execution \"didn't work out\" and limited detail about reliable operation indicate incomplete functionality and testing, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI was used and added tangible value (model notes, automated calculations), but the explanation of how AI was integrated into the tool and its functionality is brief and notes limitations. This demonstrates correct but basic integration and reflection rather than the thorough, detailed treatment required for a full PASS.",
