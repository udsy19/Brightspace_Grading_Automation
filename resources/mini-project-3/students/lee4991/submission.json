It just had some errors within the base, but as I was executing it, it didn't work out. So the first bit was the last execution. And here it shows, I just made a model of the walk and using that formula and giving a result of like what should, you know, be the minimum, be the maximum and what they recommend for a company so they can put in their numbers in here.\n\n01:45\nAnd then you see kind of what is worth it for the investment.  With these iterations, there were less because this would just calculate it. My second iteration. Let  me see if I can find my other iterations, which show  kind of expanding on  what's recommended. But the final one, I was able  to bring them all together.  To reflect on my video. um\n\n02:12\nThe AI was  able to help me create these model notes that was helpful.  And the hard part about the financial problem to engineering was  I was trying to expand and make it more complex.  And I feel like the N8  and  the website I use wasn't able to  fully expand on that.  And then ethical  considerations I faced.  Just because a lot of the data  you're putting in your own personal data that  maybe a lot of people won't be comfortable with that certain kind\n\n02:41\ncompany will have or  entering it into the internet.  And I would trust my app just because  it gave me a good analysis on what I was trying to understand. And um especially if I want to have different  investments in the future, I can use this model to do that."
