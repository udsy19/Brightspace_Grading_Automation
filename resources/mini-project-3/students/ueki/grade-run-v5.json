  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it produces allocation recommendations and scenario comparisons, integrates real-time market data, and enforces risk guardrails tied to user profiles. The IMPLEMENT and REFLECT evidence shows the student built and iterated a financial workflow rather than only describing concepts, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration (API prompts, system instructions, function calls for live market data) and applies it to produce contextual, personalized scenario comparisons with safety guardrails. DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) show purposeful design, implementation, and iteration, meeting the threshold for thorough, value-adding AI integration.",
