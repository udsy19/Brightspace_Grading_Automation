  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application: it logs transactions, calculates monthly averages/predictions, compares against a budget, and updates Google Sheets via an AI-driven add-entry workflow. Implementation and reflection evidence show the tool was built, debugged, and successfully writes updates, meeting the financial-app criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates an effective AI integration: they designed a system message and agent using GPT-4.1-mini, connected the agent to Google Sheets via an add-entry tool and JavaScript transformation, and iterated until the agent produced and updated outputs. This shows the AI adds functional value (automated logging and prediction) rather than being superficial.",
