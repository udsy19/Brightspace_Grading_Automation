  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working financial application: it ingests ticker data, uses minute/15‑minute/hour candlesticks plus news, merges/cleans data, and outputs trade recommendations via Telegram. The Discover description and the Implement demonstration together show the tool performs financial tasks as required.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a coherent AI integration pipeline (multi-timescale price data + news sentiment → cleaning/merge → AI agent opinion) and a working example delivering recommendations in Telegram, showing the AI adds value beyond superficial use. The described implementation and demo satisfy the requirement for effective AI integration.",
