  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a functioning financial application: it ingests financial inputs, uses market assumptions and scenario-building to produce asset allocations, expected return estimates, and a recommended scenario. Implementation and reflection evidence show the student built and iterated the tool, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration (LM chain, external market-data HTTP calls, scenario-generation and explanation LLM nodes) and produces actionable outputs (scenario allocations, expected returns, recommended plan), showing the AI adds real value. The student also reflects on implementation challenges, indicating hands-on AI integration rather than superficial mention.",
