  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates that the tool performs financial tasks (investment recommendations, returns, asset suggestions, charts) and reports successful implementation of those features. Reflection on disclaimers and advisor verification further supports functional financial application rather than a vague concept.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly demonstrates an AI-integrated tool that produces concrete, valuable outputs (recommendations, graphs, confidence metrics, suggested actions) and implemented it via prompts. They also reflect on usability (prompt engineering) and ethics (disclaimers), supporting that AI is effectively integrated and adds value rather than being superficial.",
