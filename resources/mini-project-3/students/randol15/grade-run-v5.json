  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial assistant: it collects investor inputs, classifies profiles, provides allocation examples, and generates portfolio analyses/visuals using market data (S&P modeling, 5‑ vs 10‑year comparisons). The student describes implementation and iterative improvement, meeting the criterion for a working financial app with substantive examples.\n- Integrate AI: The student clearly integrated AI (built a GPT-based chatbot) and used it to generate substantive, value-adding outputs (profile-driven allocations, historical S&P visuals with sources). Iterative refinement and inclusion of sources/disclaimers demonstrate purposeful, non-superficial AI integration, meeting the PASS standard.",
