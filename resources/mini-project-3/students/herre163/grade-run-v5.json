  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a working financial application workflow: it gathers a goal, fetches real-time market/inflation data, reasons about options, and returns a concrete recommendation with risk scoring. Implementation details (Google Search grounding, token-budgeted reasoning, JSON schema) and the example recommendation support that the tool functions as a financial app.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration (Gemini model, Search grounding) applied to a realistic scenario and includes implementation details (thinking budget, JSON schema) that add value beyond a superficial mention. The described Implement and Verify steps demonstrate effective use of AI for grounding, reasoning, and transparent outputs, meeting the PASS standard.",
