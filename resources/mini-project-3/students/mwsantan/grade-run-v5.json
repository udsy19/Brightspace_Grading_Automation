  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application that performs calculations and provides analysis/advice (goal inputs, math, risk levels, recommendations) and validates accuracy through testing. The Discover/Implement/Reflect evidence shows both functional implementation and refinement, meeting the PASS standard for thorough treatment.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates meaningful, functional AI integration: the app routes structured math results to Gemini to produce contextual analysis and recommendations, and the student validated and refined the model to avoid hallucinations. This shows thoughtful, effective use of AI beyond a superficial add-on.",
