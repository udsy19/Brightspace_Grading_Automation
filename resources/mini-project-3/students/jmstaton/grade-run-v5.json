  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial tool: it tracks net worth, categorizes spending, issues alerts, analyzes transaction drivers, and projects impacts on goals. Discover and Implement evidence show both the conceptual goal and an implemented app providing concrete financial functionality, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration: automated detection of spending changes, transaction-history analysis identifying drivers, impact projection (delay to home down payment), and suggested actions. These specific features show more than superficial use and align with both Discover and Implement stages, satisfying the PASS standard.",
