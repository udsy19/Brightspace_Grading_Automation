Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a clear conceptual financial application (planning tool that outputs required monthly investments and supports strategy choices), but it lacks detailed calculations, examples, or demonstrated outputs. That correct but basic treatment meets the MODERATE standard for a PARTIAL score rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission indicates an implemented feature that tailors monthly investment recommendations to a chosen strategy (suggesting AI-driven personalization), but the treatment is brief and lacks detail about how AI is used or what value it adds. This demonstrates correct but basic integration rather than the thorough, well-explained AI integration required for a full pass.",
