  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application with concrete calculations (loan amount, monthly payment, total paid, interest) and multiple example scenarios, plus iterative development per DRIVER stages. Despite some performance issues noted in reflection, the app performs the required financial tasks, meeting the PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a functioning AI-enabled chat that accepts natural inputs and computes loan amounts, monthly payments, and total interest with example scenarios—demonstrating clear value beyond superficial use (Discover + Implement). The student also reflects on limitations and performance, indicating iterative development and awareness of constraints (Reflect), which supports a PASS.",
