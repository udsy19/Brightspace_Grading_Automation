  "transcript": "Good afternoon. Today I'm going to be\ngoing over my AI powered financial\ndecision advisor. Starts here with the\nchat trigger node.\nUm that also goes down to just a normal\nconversation memory which is also\nattached to my financial advisor agent.\nThat way both of these remember what was\ninputed by the user. As we go over here,\nwe're using the open eye AI chat model.\nAnd then over here there's a few more\ntools connected to this financial\nadvisor agent. There's the market data\nAPI tool, a risk calculator tool, and a\nscenario comparison tool. And then this\nis what outputs will look like.\nSo you can kind of see here it's a\nbasic here. It kind of tells you what it\ncan do. Real time market analysis,\nadvanced risk assessment, investment\nscenario,\ncontextual financial guidance. Sign up.\nI'll give you some example questions to\nask and there's also disclaimer.\nUm, so I'll ask a few questions here.\nStart off by\nwould investing in Google\nright now be smart for longterm\nand then it's going to give me an\nanalysis on this question I just asked\nand it'll go in depth and also tell me\nlike what may be a downside and then it\nalso can compare it to other things if\nyou ask it\nSo, here's all the stuff that it will\nshow. Uh, kind of has some basic stuff\nthat it pulls from the internet. Yahoo\nFinance, I believe. Uh, current market\noverview, shows the financial health of\nGoogle,\nlong-term growth potential, has a little\nrisk assessment here that it um goes\nover by calculating a hypothetical\ninvestment scenario just to show you\nkind of a real time or a real example.\nUm there's some of the risk metrics and\nthen conclusion. So it says it's\nactually a smart decision for long-term\ngrowth given its uh strong financial\nhealth. And there's also some\nrecommendations here. And yeah, that's\nwhat this tool is capable of evaluatingdifferent stocks. Thank you."
