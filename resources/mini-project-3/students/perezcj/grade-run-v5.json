  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it connects market data, runs risk calculations, compares scenarios, and produces investment analysis and recommendations (evidence above). Discover and Implement stages show both the intended financial functionality and an executed example, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration (chat model + memory) and connected analytical tools (market data API, risk calculator, scenario comparison) that produce substantive outputs and comparisons. Given the multiple concrete components and demonstrated query→analysis flow (Discover and Implement stages), this satisfies a thorough, value-adding integration.",
