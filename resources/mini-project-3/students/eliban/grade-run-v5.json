  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application: programmatic real-time data fetching (yfinance), AI-driven valuation and risk outputs, and a live demo analyzing Microsoft. Implementation and verification evidence shows the tool performs concrete financial tasks, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows concrete, effective AI integration: programmatic real-time data ingestion to reduce hallucination, explicit prompt engineering to produce structured investment analyses, and a working Replet demo of the AI's outputs. These demonstrate depth and practical application beyond a superficial use, meeting the PASS standard.",
