  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application: it defines inputs/outputs, executes scenarios that produce concrete present- and future-value numbers, and reflects on those results. The Discover and Implement stages show the tool was built and used; the Reflect stage shows conceptual understanding of the financial outputs, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Integrate AI: The student explicitly used AI to build a user-input financial workflow and demonstrated its outputs across multiple scenarios with concrete numbers, showing that AI integration added analytic value. The combination of discovery, hands-on implementation, and reflection indicates a thorough, effective integration of AI.",
