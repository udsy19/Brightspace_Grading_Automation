  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it retrieves live market data, computes valuation metrics, applies risk-profile constraints, and issues actionable investment advice (tested across loops). The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages show clear design and execution; the REFLECT stage confirms the tool meets its financial purpose.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows concrete AI integration: an agent that pulls live data, enforces source constraints to avoid hallucinations, applies valuation logic and user risk profiles, and produces actionable advisory outputs. The evidence spans Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages and demonstrates a thorough, functioning integration rather than a superficial mention, meeting PASS criteria.",
