Retail\n0:25\ninvestors however face three distinct\n0:28\nissues. One that is information\n0:30\noverload. It is statistically impossible\n0:33\nto um manually cross reference every uh\n0:37\nreal time news with fundamentals every\n0:39\nday just in your head um as a person\n0:42\nwhich leads to decision par paralysis.\n0:45\nUm furthermore we have a context gap. A\n0:48\nlot of the metrics that we see online in\n0:50\nterms of like a stock say like the PE\n0:51\nratio it's just a number to us. um\n0:54\nwithout comparing it to any historical\n0:56\ntrend or industry um like like industry\n1:01\npeers it's which is like relative\n1:04\nvaluation investors often fall into\n1:06\nvalue traps as they're not fully aware\n1:08\nof the true u meaning behind the metrics\n1:12\num and lastly we have a behavioral bias\n1:16\num this I feel like is the biggest\n1:18\ndetriment to returns I feel like people\n1:21\nlike from a psychological standpoint\n1:23\nPeople often suffer from like FOMO which\n1:25\nis fear of missing out or like loss\n1:28\naversion like they don't want to miss\n1:29\nout on something or like miss out on a\n1:31\ngood deal types. Um so we emotionally\n1:34\nwill buy at the top and then panic at\n1:37\nthe bottom. So I tried to\n1:43\nalmost like manipulate this agent to\n1:45\nsolve these um issues by replacing\n1:48\nemotional emotion with a more automated\n1:52\nfinancial discipline.\n1:54\nSo before we jump into the different\n1:57\nloops um I kind of wanted to look at the\n2:01\nsystem instructions specifically.\n2:04\nUm so based on my research in\n2:07\ntraditional wealth management usually\n2:09\nwhen a manager before it's able to\n2:11\ninvest for a client or do anything like\n2:14\nthat it's give it needs a investment\n2:17\npolicy statement which kind of uh locks\n2:22\nin what exactly the wealth manager can\n2:24\ndo and in this case if I'm treating mark\n2:28\nuh treating this like so the name of my\n2:30\num tools market mind if I treat it that\n2:32\nway as a wealth manager I need to give\n2:35\nit a certain set of instructions that it\n2:36\nneeds to absolutely follow like a\n2:38\ncertain set of mandates or fiduciary\n2:40\nmandate um to ensure that it's acting\n2:44\nagainst like a user's bad habits. So\n2:47\nwhat I did was I added a source lock\n2:49\nwhere I said that um to fix that whole\n2:53\ninformation overload problem, I forced\n2:55\nthe agent to ignore its internal trading\n2:57\ndata and strictly um query to Yahoo\n3:02\nFinance's data, their live data. Uh\n3:04\nensuring that we trade on facts and not\n3:07\nlike hallucinations cuz AI is known to\n3:09\nmake um make up numbers at times. So\n3:13\nthis kind of ensures that it looks\n3:15\nspecifically at a certain source and\n3:17\nonly gets this information from there.\n3:20\nUm then I also put a little valuation\n3:23\nanchor\n3:24\nto fix the whole context gap. I\n3:26\nprogrammed the logic such that that if\n3:30\nthe PE here exceeds the industry\n3:34\nstandard\n3:36\num you flag a stock as like speculative\n3:39\nor high risk and if it's like below a\n3:42\ncertain number you flag it as a\n3:43\npotential value. This essentially forces\n3:45\na risk adjusted view of different stocks\n3:48\nand then there's a risk constraint\n3:51\nto fix the whole behavioral bias. The\n3:54\nsystem strictly adheres to the user's\n3:56\nrisk profile which we'll see in further\n3:58\nloops um as your risk tolerance was uh\n4:01\nspecified. It essentially acts as a\n4:03\nrational check against issues like fear\n4:05\nof missing out.\n4:07\nUm and just to highlight how it's going\n4:11\nto be um pulling in data from the\n4:14\ninternet uh through Yahoo Finance or\n4:16\nlike Business Insider on Bloomberg, I've\n4:18\nessentially put the tool to ground uh in\n4:21\nGoogle search uh along with my system\n4:24\ninstructions. So for loop one,\n4:29\nuh this is just I'm just trying to test\n4:31\nwhether the data is accurate. So, uh I'm\n4:34\ngoing to give it a basic uh prompt like\n4:37\nI'm thinking\n4:39\nof um buying\n4:44\nuh Tesla stocks,\n4:48\nwhich is its ticker. Um and I'm just\n4:51\ngoing to ask if it's is it a good idea\n4:53\nright now.\n4:55\nGood idea. Right.\n5:02\nAnd I'm going to run this\n5:05\nIf you look at this, what I'm doing is\n5:08\nmy my prompt is a very lazy users\n5:10\nprompt. I'm just asking is Tesla a good\n5:13\nidea. I've not given it any\n5:14\nspecifications of where to pull the data\n5:16\nin from, what my risk profile is, none\n5:18\nof that. Um, and right now, if you look\n5:21\nat the thinking thing, it's kind of\n5:22\ngoing through Yahoo Finance and all the\n5:25\ninternet sources to ensure that it's uh\n5:29\naccurate.\n5:30\nAnd this is the data that it got. Um, if\n5:34\nyou look at it, even though I didn't ask\n5:37\nfor it, the agent autonomously executed\n5:39\na search on the internet to find the\n5:42\nlive price and the PE ratio.\n5:46\nUm,\n5:48\nit didn't just like guess. It kind of\n5:49\ndidn't make up its own numbers, but and\n5:52\nit's giving me citations for everything.\n5:53\nSo, if I want to double check, I go do\n5:55\nthat. But, um, it went out and tried to\n5:58\ndiscover the actual values. This kind of\n6:01\ngives me the idea that okay, the\n6:02\nfoundation of our advice is factually\n6:04\naccurate and dynamic.\n6:07\nNow for the second loop,\n6:10\num if you look at this section, the\n6:11\ncontext and the verdict section here,\n6:15\num a basic chatbot, so if I just ask\n6:18\nlike GPU or something, it would just\n6:21\ntell me that Tesla's a car company\n6:24\nbecause I had a valuation anchor within\n6:26\ninstruction within my system of\n6:27\ninstructions. Um this tool reasons\n6:30\nthrough the numbers. So it uses numbers\n6:32\nas its uh for to create analysis and\n6:38\npredictions. So uh it sees that the PE\n6:42\nratio is approaching 300x and it\n6:45\ncompares this to S&P 500 over 2025\n6:48\nhistorically around 20 20 to 25x\n6:51\nvaluation. It essentially then\n6:53\nautomatically\n6:55\num flags this as a high risk compared to\n6:58\nthe auto industry average by using\n7:01\ndeductive reasoning through the values\n7:03\nthat it that it pulled in from the\n7:05\nonline sources and through the based on\n7:08\nthe high PE plus the news articles that\n7:10\nare available online because it also\n7:13\npulls in um information from uh news\n7:16\narticles about the particular stock or\n7:18\nthe particular company. It uses\n7:20\ndeductive reasoning to determine whether\n7:22\nthe ver whether this is a high-risisk\n7:24\nand speculative stock which in this case\n7:26\nit is\n7:29\nessentially it's giving me the narrative\n7:31\nbehind the numbers and giving me the\n7:33\nidea giving me a better idea of whether\n7:35\nthis is a good stock or not which and\n7:38\nbased on whatever is given hold off on\n7:40\nit right now because it's higher to stop\n7:43\nuh if my risk profile was low. Um, now\n7:46\nfor loop three,\n7:48\num, I'm going to evolve this such that\n7:51\nthe AI acts as a strategic advisor.\n7:55\nSo, I'm going to tell it that I have a\n7:59\nlow risk tolerance.\n8:03\nUm,\n8:05\nsorry, tolerance. Um, and want to hold\n8:11\nfor 2 years.\n8:13\n2 years.\n8:15\nOkay.\n8:17\nTwo years. Um based on the data.\n8:24\nUm\n8:25\nyou found\n8:28\nuh what is my spec what should be my\n8:31\nspecific route?\n8:36\nMy specific\n8:42\nOkay. And then I'm going to run this.\n8:46\nEssentially, we're moving on from\n8:48\nanalysis to advisory. So, I'm giving the\n8:51\nuh the agent a constraint telling it\n8:53\nthat I am a I have a low risk tolerance.\n8:57\nAnd uh it evolves it essentially is now\n9:02\ngoing to tell me what to do accordingly.\n9:05\nSo, I'm just going to wait for it to\n9:06\nblend.\n9:12\nOkay. So, let's I'm going to see whether\n9:14\nthis is consistent with the top because\n9:16\nthe the previous output told me that\n9:19\nit's a very high risk uh it's a high\n9:22\nrisk speculative stock. So, as if I was\n9:25\nhypothetically if I was a low risk\n9:26\ntolerance um investor, I would avoid or\n9:29\nI would hold on buying the stock and\n9:30\nprobably wait for a dip. Um but let's\n9:34\nsee what the model says.\n9:36\nOkay. So, based on everything that\n9:41\nthis says, okay,\n9:44\nlook at the verdict here. It tells me do\n9:46\nnot buy or like avoid the stall\n9:49\ncompletely. It calculated that paying\n9:52\nyour a certain amount of money or your\n9:54\nearnings is mathematically incompatible\n9:57\nwith a lowrisk profile.\n9:59\nThis is because\n10:02\nsee it's trading at 287x earnings. This\n10:05\nis just and the it's comparing to the\n10:08\nS&P 500 which tra which trades at\n10:10\napproximately 20x. You're paying a lot\n10:14\nmore premium compared to the average\n10:16\nstock. So it's telling me that it's\n10:18\ndefinitely not compatible with a lower\n10:20\nrisk profile. It's also look at it\n10:22\nlooking at its volatility telling me\n10:24\nthat the beta the market uh if the\n10:28\nmarket drops 10% uh Tesla will drop uh\n10:31\n2x uh will drop a double amount for\n10:34\nlower investors telling me this is\n10:36\nquantitatively unsuitable.\n10:39\nIt essentially evolves the output into a\n10:42\nspecific strategy telling me that it's\n10:44\nvery volatile has um it's incompatible\n10:47\nwith a low risk profile because its\n10:49\nvaluation is too high and the new cycle\n10:51\nis telling me that it's ridiculously\n10:53\novervalued. Essentially evolves the\n10:55\noutput from a specific strategy to a\n10:57\nmore uh to it's it's giving me what to\n11:01\ndo. perhaps advising me to wait for a\n11:03\ndip. As I said earlier, lower the price\n11:05\ntarget to successfully protect my\n11:08\ncapital that I'm investing in by\n11:10\napplying my personal risk profile to the\n11:12\nlive data.\n11:14\nSo, it's just telling me to avoid\n11:16\ncompletely. I I personally feel like by\n11:19\ncreating an agent that acts as a\n11:21\nfiduciary\n11:23\nwhich automatically ver verifies all the\n11:25\ndata and enforces all types of risk\n11:26\ncontrols. This specific tool solves the\n11:29\nproblem of emotional investing. And um\n11:32\nit doesn't just answer questions, it\n11:33\nessentially protects the user um from\n11:36\nmaking decisions that uh may not match\n11:39\ntheir risk profile. and it gives a\n11:42\npretty comprehensive look of doing uh\n11:44\ncomprehensive information and\n11:46\ncomparisons to help you make that\n11:47\ndecision. So yeah, thank you"
