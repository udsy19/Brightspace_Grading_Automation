  "transcript": "Hello everyone. Uh I'm Shri and for my\nmanagement 310 I am presenting the mini\nproject 3 which is an AI goal-based\ninvestment guide built using Gemini and\nPython in Google Collab environment. Uh\nthe goal was to build an intelligent\ntool that advises on the why and not\njust the what. Uh this tool is designed\nfor users who have a specific financial\ngoal like saving for a retirement or a\nhouse. Uh I start by providing national\nlanguage input, a goal, a time horizon\nand a risk preference. So we could use\nthe goal like an investment strategy for\nbuying a house in seven years. Uh the\nfirst AI step is\nokay. So first up we are setting up all\nour Gemini AP keys uh which is right\nhere and then for our first function\nwhich is context parsing. So, Gemini\nacts as a data parser which means it's\ntransforming complex text uh into a\nstructured JSON object which is critical\nbecause it establishes the user's memory\nuh or state and gives us reliable time\nhorizons of 25 years and a risk\ntolerance of high and moderate. Uh the\nnext function integrates external data\nuh which should be this one uh to ensure\nthe advice is current using a mock API\ncall for S&P 500 price. The second and\nthe core step is core reasoning. Uh the\nAI is prompted as a senior investment\nstrategist using the parsed profile and\nthe external market data to run a\nmulti-step logic analysis. The output is\nhighly structured JSON report. Notice\nthat the output includes a scenario\ncomparison. Uh our recommended portfolio\nversus a more conservative option.\nBefore presenting the final answer, uh\nwe have a sanity check here. Uh the\nPython code checks that the recommended\nasset allocation. Uh the percentages of\nstocks plus bonds and cash sum up\nexactly\nuh 200 preventing any mathematically\nflawed advice. This addresses the\nrequirement for safety and accuracy.\nFinally, the output is rendered in a\nclear formatted table. Here\nwe go. So the key difference here is the\nintelligence of the tool. The rational\nexplains why the portfolio is\naggressive. Uh because the 25\nyear horizon can weather market uh\nfluctuations.\nUh for my reflection building this like\nprompt engineering to ensure AI is\nmaintained like the mathematical rules\nof summing.\nuh we just made sure of that for the\naccuracy. While I would use this tool\nfor prim like preliminary insights, I\nwould not trust it with like real money\nwithout any other human interaction or\nreview. Uh so as you can see here, this\nis the output that we get uh once we ask\nfor the investment strategy for buying a\nhouse in 7 years. This is the Y. So, the\nportfolio is designed for an investment\nwith a low risk tolerance and a\nseven-year time horizon. This\nsignificant 500 allocation to bond\nsupported by the current 4.5 yield.\nOh, I'm sorry. I forgot to mention the\nuser goal. So, here we have I have a $15\nuh,000 saved and contribute to $500 a\nmonth and I want to buy a house in 7\nyears, but I'm nervous about the risk\nand what would I say if you know a\nmoderate low tolerance. So, here's the\noutput with what you want to do and like\nwhy you want to do it. And that would beall for the mini case. Thank yo"
