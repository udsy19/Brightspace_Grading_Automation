  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it ingests user financial goals and constraints, integrates market data, computes and outputs portfolio recommendations (including an example scenario), and includes validation checks. IMPLEMENT and DISCOVER evidence show the system pipeline and concrete financial outputs, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive AI integration: Gemini is used for context parsing, external-data-informed multi-step reasoning, and generation of structured JSON scenario comparisons, with implemented sanity checks and reflexive prompt engineering. These elements demonstrate effective AI use beyond superficial calls, meeting the PASS standard.",
