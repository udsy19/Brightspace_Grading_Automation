You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application: a finance AI coach that programmatically constructs scenarios, invokes a model to compare investment vs savings, and verifies outputs with tests and guardrails. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Verify/Evolve/Reflect) provide concrete implementation and validation evidence, satisfying the criterion thoroughly.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective AI integration: the workflow uses code+model separation with structured JSON passed to GPT-4, explicit prompts and output structure, and programmatic guardrails/sanity checks that shape model behavior. These specifics (Reason + Implement + Verify/Reflect) go beyond superficial use and show practical, thoughtful integration.",
