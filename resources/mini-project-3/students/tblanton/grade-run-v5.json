You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student presents a working financial application (expense tracker) that successfully records and categorizes transactions in a Google Sheet and documents a live example adding $120 at Aldi. The reflection on debugging the system message further confirms functional implementation and understanding, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates a working AI integration that automates expense entry and categorization, evidencing concrete implementation and a real-world example plus iterative refinement. This shows the AI adds functional value beyond superficial use, satisfying PASS.",
