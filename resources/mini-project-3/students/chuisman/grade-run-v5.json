  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a working financial application: it fetches real-time market/news data, uses sentiment/math divergence analysis, and outputs investment-focused summaries and verdicts (e.g., Apple report with sentiment score and buy/hold guidance). Implementation and reflection evidence show the tool both performs financial tasks and was tested end-to-end, meeting the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration: live API ingestion, preprocessing (50 articles), a prompting strategy/persona, and an analysis step comparing text to sentiment scores (Implement). The student also framed the problem motivating AI use (Discover) and reflected on the added value (Reflect), satisfying the PASS standard for effective AI integration.",
