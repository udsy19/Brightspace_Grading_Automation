  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes concrete financial computations (net worth, cashflow), scenario-based affordability analysis with structured outputs, and technical integrations (data retrieval, JSON schemas) that enable reliable financial functionality. These specifics across Discover, Implement, Reason, and Verify stages demonstrate a thorough, working financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes concrete, repeated AI integrations (context injection, system prompts, retrieval-augmented generation, strict JSON outputs) that add clear functional value (personalized advice, verifiable scenario scoring). The use of DRIVER stages—especially Implement, Discover, and Verify—demonstrates a thorough, practical approach to embedding AI, meeting PASS criteria.",
