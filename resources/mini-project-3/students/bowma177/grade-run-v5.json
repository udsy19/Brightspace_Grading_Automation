  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application by describing specific financial data sources, risk-calculation tools, and outputs (metrics, VaR, Sharpe, scenario comparisons) and shows iterative improvement of the tool. These details across Discover/Implement/Reflect stages provide substantive evidence the tool performs financial tasks, meeting PASS standards.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive, functional AI integration—multiple distinct AI/data components are connected and produce actionable outputs (metrics, risk assessment, recommendations). The student also demonstrates implementation work and iterative refinement, supporting that AI adds real value rather than being superficial.",
