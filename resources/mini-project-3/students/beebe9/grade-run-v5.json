  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows multiple concrete financial functions (trending stocks by sector, GDP comparisons, Bitcoin pricing and analysis, charts) and explains the intended design and safeguards, satisfying the criterion that it functions as a financial application. Reliability issues were noted but do not negate the demonstrated financial capabilities, so the work meets PASS under the moderate evaluation standards.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete, repeated AI integration (API data, multi-step reasoning, automated analysis and visualizations) across multiple examples, and the student reflects on benefits and limitations—meeting the threshold for thorough, value-adding integration. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) provide coherent evidence of effective AI integration.",
