  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a functioning financial application through multiple concrete examples (real-time crypto pricing and news, GDP analysis with charts, trending stocks grouped by sector) and an implemented query/analysis flow. While the student notes stability issues, the tool nonetheless performs core financial tasks and provides analysis and sources, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows multiple, concrete AI integrations (API-driven price/news retrieval, multi-step reasoning, charts, sector grouping) and discusses guardrails and limitations, meeting the requirement for effective AI integration. The student also reflects on utility and reliability, supporting a thorough, applied integration rather than a superficial mention.",
