  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial tool that records income/expenses, categorizes entries, and computes net income, with live examples of single and batch inputs and confirmation of successful recordings (Discover + Implement). The student's reflection confirms iterative improvement but does not undermine functionality, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates effective AI integration: they connected Gemini and memory to an entry tool, designed a prompt to extract structured fields, and implemented interactive handling of ambiguous inputs that updates the spreadsheet (net income). Multiple concrete examples and implementation details across Discover and Implement support a thorough, value-adding integration.",
