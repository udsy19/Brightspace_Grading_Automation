  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it accepts capital‑budgeting inputs, computes and displays cash flows/analysis, and compares projects (IMPLEMENT evidence). The student also shows conceptual understanding and reflection on limitations, adding features (pros/cons) to improve financial decision quality (DISCOVER and REFLECT), meeting the standards for PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a working AI integration that computes and analyzes capital‑budget metrics and provides narrative \"deep dive\" analyses, and the student extended the tool (comparison dashboard, pros/cons) to improve AI outputs. This demonstrates effective, value‑adding AI integration at a level appropriate for the assignment.",
