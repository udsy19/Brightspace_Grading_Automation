  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application—implemented in N8N—that performs concrete mortgage calculations with formatted outputs and multiple examples (e.g., $2,272.18 and $2,809 monthly payments). Discover and Implement evidence show intent and a functioning workflow; Reflect evidence shows iterative improvement, supporting a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration (chat model, memory, calculator, structured output) and shows it adds value (formatted financial summaries, budget impact). Implementation examples and the reflection on adding memory indicate the integration is functional and thoughtfully applied rather than superficial.",
