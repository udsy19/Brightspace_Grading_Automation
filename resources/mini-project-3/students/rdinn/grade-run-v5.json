  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student demonstrates a functioning financial application concept: a named tool (Finn AI) that accepts natural-language financial queries, processes them through a multi-step pipeline, returns structured analyses, and was tested against real questions. The described implementation, validator, memory, and verification steps satisfy the moderate standard for a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a thorough, concrete AI integration: a multi-step pipeline with intent parsing, a dedicated AI agent using system prompts, a validator to catch hallucinations, structured outputs, and a memory layer for personalization. The student demonstrated design, testing, and iteration (Discover, Implement, Verify, Reflect), meeting the criteria for effective AI integration.",
