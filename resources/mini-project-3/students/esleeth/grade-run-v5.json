  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it retrieves live market data, extracts key metrics, synthesizes opportunities/risks, and produces a Buy/Hold/Sell investment thesis with structured output and fallback behavior. The described Discover and Implement stages provide specific, concrete evidence that the tool performs financial tasks end-to-end.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows substantive AI integration: multiple specialized agents using OpenAI models, a custom tool to fetch market data, and structured parsing to feed AI reasoning—this goes beyond superficial use and adds clear value. The Discover and Implement stages provide concrete design and execution evidence, satisfying the PASS standard.",
