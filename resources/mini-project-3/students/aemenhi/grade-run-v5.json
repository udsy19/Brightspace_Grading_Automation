  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built and ran a functioning financial application that analyzes invest vs. debt-payoff decisions: they stated the goal, executed workflows with nodes that \"executed correctly,\" and produced financial outputs/data. Driver evidence (Discover, Implement, Reflect) shows the tool both performs financial tasks and was validated, meeting the PASS criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The student implemented an AI-backed workflow that ingests inputs, calls an AI model, and returns structured, actionable outputs (recommendation, key findings, action plan), demonstrating functional integration that adds value. Iterations, execution evidence, and reflection on verification support that the AI use is substantive, not superficial, meeting the PASS standard.",
