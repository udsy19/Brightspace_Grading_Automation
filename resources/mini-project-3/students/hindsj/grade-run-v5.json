  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built and demonstrated a working financial application that ingests news, analyzes sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral) and assigns a numeric score, with examples shown (crypto buy headline and a neutral personal-savings article). Implementation details and a live demo description provide sufficient evidence of functional financial task performance.\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI as a core processing step (classification, scoring, and brief explanation) tied into an automated RSS-to-Google-Sheet pipeline and demonstrates sample outputs that show the AI adds actionable value. The student describes the implementation and provides examples, meeting the requirements for a thorough, effective AI integration.",
