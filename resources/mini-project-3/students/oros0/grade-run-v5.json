  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial application (an AI-powered financial explanation engine with input prompts, multiple complexity levels, history/favorites, and API integration). Implement-stage evidence of functional features plus the described use cases supports a PASS.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective AI integration: an API-driven engine that generates tiered explanations and includes persistent memory/favorites, showing functionality beyond superficial calls. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear evidence of purposeful AI use and iterative improvement, satisfying the PASS criteria.",
