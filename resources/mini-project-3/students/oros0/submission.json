So, we had to build an\n\n3\n00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,840\nadvanced AI finance tool using like an\n\n4\n00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:20,320\nAI AP API key or anything that takes um\n\n5\n00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,279\nit creates an AI response based on what\n\n6\n00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,039\nyou input. So, like our other our other\n\n7\n00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,720\nprojects were just focused on like\n\n8\n00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,160\nstraight up calculations, but this one's\n\n9\n00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,640\nmore of like an AI approach. author AI\n\n10\n00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,719\nkey. And\n\n11\n00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,960so what I did was I I said, \"Give me a\n\n12\n00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,200\nbasic AI prompt for a financial app that\n\n13\n00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,239\nwill use AI to turn any financial prompt\n\n14\n00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,120that I give it.\" So I the thing that I\n\n15\n00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,559\nwanted to do was I wanted to have like a\n\n16\n00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,199\nfinancial prompt or you like I don't\n\n17\n00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,280\nknow what this means. Let me input what\n\n18\n00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,719\ndoes this mean into the search bar. And\n\n19\n00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,080\nit it gives uh definitions from like a\n\n20\n00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,920\nfifth grade level to a like\n\n21\n00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280\na good like financial advisor\n\n22\n00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,520\nstandpoint. So like one to five on the\n\n23\n00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040\nlevel pretty much.\n\n24\n00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400\nSo from easy definition to more advanced\n\n25\n00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000\ndefinition. So this is what I came up\n\n26\n00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720\nwith.\n\n27\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,240\nThis is what I created\n\n28\n00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,960\nthrough the app VO and it is a financial\n\n29\n00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,960\nexplanation engine. So um\n\n30\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280\nlet me go down here. Basic AI\n\n31\n00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360\nintegration. So this is what it's you're\n\n32\n00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960\ngoing to input a question and you're\n\n33\n00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,840\ngoing to pick the complexity level\n\n34\n00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,240\nbetween very simple basic intermediate\n\n35\n00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439\nadvanced and then expert and it kind of\n\n36\n00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,560\non the right side it kind of gives you\n\n37\n00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:51,680\nthe so we can go for explain like I'm\n\n38\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,720\nfive or NBA professional depths. So\n\n39\n00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,040\nlet me scroll down here.\n\n40\n00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,439\nthe requirements. So, the advanced\n\n41\n00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560\ncapabilities that it has, it it actually\n\n42\n00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,119\num the first version only had just the\n\n43\n00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,879\nstraight up calculator and then I\n\n44\n00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,640\ncreated a second version where it had a\n\n45\n00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,959\nmemory state which is the history. It\n\n46\n00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,800\nactually saves the history like I I\n\n47\n00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,599\ntried it earlier and it still has the\n\n48\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,160\nhistory from here. So it has a memory\n\n49\n00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,920\nstates and um it also uses the data in\n\n50\n00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,360\nintegrations via the API.\n\n51\n00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520\nAll right. So let's go ahead and test\n\n52\n00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,640\nthis out. Let's start on very simple.\n\n53\n00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,280\nI'm going to ask let's see how does the\n\n54\n00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,519\nstock market even work.\n\n55\n00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440\nLet's have a general explanation for\n\n56\n00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,040\nthat. So, exclamation level one.\n\n57\n00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,959\nHow does the stock market even work?\n\n58\n00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,680\nThat's my question.\n\n59\n00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,680\nAnd it's going to\n\n60\n00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,519\ncreate an AI. It's taking a while, but\n\n61\n00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,640\nit's creating an AI uh question or\n\n62\n00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560\nanswer to that. So, it says, imagine you\n\n63\n00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,560\nwant to understand money stuff. This is\n\n64\n00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720\nabout how money works in a really simple\n\n65\n00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,319\nway. Think of it like trading toys with\n\n66\n00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680\nfriends. You give something, you get\n\n67\n00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040\nsomething back. It's basically what\n\n68\n00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,200\nhappens here, but with money instead of\n\n69\n00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,800\ntoys. All right, so now let's do how\n\n70\n00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560\ndoes the stock market work in an\n\n71\n00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879\nintermediate level. Generate an\n\n72\n00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360\nexplanation for this. I'm not really\n\n73\n00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,760\nsure why it's taking so long, but we'll\n\n74\n00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,040\njust read the first base part. When I\n\n75\n00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879\ndid this earlier, it didn't take as\n\n76\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,000\nlong. It's probably because the video is\n\n77\n00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,000\ngoing, but\n\n78\n00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400\nlet it run for a second. So yeah, the\n\n79\n00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,760\nreason why I want to do this one is\n\n80\n00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,560\nbecause a lot of people\n\n81\n00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640\nhave questions about like financial\n\n82\n00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,599\nthings and\n\n83\n00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,519\nthis is a financial based like AI bot.\n\n84\n00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:06,000\nSo it shows you or it tells you what\n\n85\n00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,480\nit's uh tells you the financial\n\n86\n00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480\nquestions you might be wondering and\n\n87\n00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480\nyeah so I'm just going to read off this\n\n88\n00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,680\nright now. So this is intermediate level\n\n89\n00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959\nfinance concept that involves\n\n90\n00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720\nunderstanding market mechanics,\n\n91\n00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,400\nvaluation principles or economic\n\n92\n00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320\nrelationships. A real world example is\n\n93\n00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000\nconsider how businesses make decisions.\n\n94\n00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520\nThey evaluate cost versus benefits,\n\n95\n00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,680\nexcess risks and project future\n\n96\n00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120\noutcomes. This same framework applies to\n\n97\n00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000\npersonal finance investing and corporate\n\n98\n00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680\nstrategy and then some key factors time\n\n99\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360\nhorizon and goals, risk tolerance,\n\n100\n00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,120\nmarket conditions and an alternative\n\n101\n00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400\noptions available. So, something that I\n\n102\n00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280\nactually created in the second version\n\n103\n00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,320\nof this in my loop 2 was you can hit add\n\n104\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,479\nto favorites and you can actually go\n\n105\n00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,960\nover to your favorites tab. I'm going to\n\n106\n00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,639\nfull screen this.\n\n107\n00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,639\nYou go over to your favorites tab and\n\n108\n00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960\nyou can click on this and it brings up\n\n109\n00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800\nthe question that you had. So, I can\n\n110\n00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639\nalso go to my history. These are the two\n\n111\n00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,720\nthat I did earlier. What is compound\n\n112\n00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199\ninterest? I can click on that and it\n\n113\n00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,600\ngives me a rough explanation of that\n\n114\n00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,080\none. That's my level three. And it even\n\n115\n00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919\nshows the level one versus level five.\n\n116\n00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360\nSo the level one exclamation for this is\n\n117\n00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,880\ncompound entries like a snowball rolling\n\n118\n00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560\ndownhill. So yep, that's pretty much my\n\n119\n00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,320\nsecond\n\n120\n00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,960\num loop and it's allowed for a more like\n\n121\n00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,280\nmemory based version. So thank you so\n\n122\n00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,280\nmuch for listening."
