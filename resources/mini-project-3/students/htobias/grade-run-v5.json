  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a functioning financial app with specific inputs, an actionable simulation step, and detailed financial outputs (cash flow, net worth trajectory, risk and action plan). The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence shows the tool performs financial tasks, and the REFLECT stage corroborates realistic use and limitations, satisfying the criterion.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows clear, functional AI integration (use of Google AI Studio, natural-language scenario input, automated simulation analysis) that materially enhances the tool by producing narrative analysis and actionable steps. The student also reflects on limitations and added a disclaimer, demonstrating responsible integration rather than a superficial or missing use of AI.",
