  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a functioning financial application: it analyzes public assets by ticker, produces investment theses and risk checks, computes portfolio composition/diversification, and runs scenario stress tests. The transcript shows concrete implemented features and demo outputs (asset analysis, portfolio metrics, scenario lab), satisfying a thorough demonstration of financial functionality.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates effective, non-superficial AI integration with multiple concrete features (natural-language prompts, API data, memory state, and scenario simulations) and walkthroughs of outputs. The student shows depth across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough, value-adding AI integration.",
