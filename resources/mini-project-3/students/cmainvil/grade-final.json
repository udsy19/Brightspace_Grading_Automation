  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial application through multiple concrete features and demonstrations: asset-level analysis (ticker input and thesis), portfolio analytics (composition/diversification), and scenario stress-testing with projected impacts. IMPLEMENT evidence of iterative builds plus DISCOVER/REFLECT context confirm comprehensive, functioning financial app rather than a vague concept.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration across multiple, functional components (asset analysis, portfolio snapshot, scenario lab) with examples (Tesla analysis, diversification score, stress-test) and uses APIs, memory state, and iterative prompt engineering—showing the AI adds substantive value. The student's IMPLEMENT and REFLECT stages confirm thoughtful design and handling of limitations, meeting the PASS standard.",
