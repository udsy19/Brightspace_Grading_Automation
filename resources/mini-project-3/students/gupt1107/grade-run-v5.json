  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working financial tool that ingests user financial context and returns contextual investment recommendations with structured scenario comparisons and safety guardrails (Implement + Reflect). The student also explicitly framed the financial decision and intended users (Discover) and demonstrated verification/testing, meeting the criterion for a functioning financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration (Gemini API usage) and multiple enhancements that make the AI output structured, contextual, and safer (scenario table, recommendation tie‑backs, explicit anti-risk rules). Implementation and reflection stages show iterative development and attention to reliability, meeting the \"adds value\" standard for a PASS.",
