  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission shows a working pipeline that accepts user financial inputs, fetches market data, and computes future-value scenarios with monthly compounding—concrete financial functionality meeting the criterion. Implementation details and testing (Discover + Implement + Reflect) provide thorough evidence that the tool performs financial tasks reliably.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows AI is meaningfully integrated (NLP parsing, structured reasoning, tailored explanations) and combined with programmatic calculations and guardrails, not used superficially. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence plus the REFLECT stage demonstrate a thoughtful, effective AI integration that adds clear value.",
