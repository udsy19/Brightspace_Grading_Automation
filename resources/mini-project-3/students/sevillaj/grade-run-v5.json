  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission provides detailed, concrete descriptions of financial functionality (live market data, personalized profiles, scenario projections, health score) and implementation-level outputs (structured JSON, confidence/sources, disclaimers), demonstrating a working financial application concept. DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT/REFLECT evidence together show thorough, applied treatment consistent with a PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates multiple, specific AI integrations (live market data, multi-step contextual reasoning using a persisted financial profile, structured JSON outputs, and safety guardrails) and explains their roles, satisfying thoroughness required for PASS. The Driver stages (Discover → Implement → Reflect) show coherent problem framing, concrete implementation details, and reflective justification of AI value.",
