  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application: it accepts tickers, retrieves market-based data (prices and ratios), and produces evaluative outputs (Buffett scores and verdicts). Implementation details and reflective comments confirm functional financial-task behavior despite noted limitations, meeting the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission clearly integrates AI (a Buffett decision bot that accepts prompts and produces ratings/analysis) and thus adds value, but the student reports the AI failing to produce some expected analyses and expresses frustration. Because the integration is functional yet incomplete and unreliable in parts, it demonstrates correct but partial implementation rather than thorough, robust integration.",
