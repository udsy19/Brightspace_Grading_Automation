  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Daniel Verachtert and this is my mini project three um app. So this is my first iteration. This is the I put in a ticker for stock and it will give you simple stats. So Apple price and then the important uh ratio. Then my second iteration is a Warren Buffett decision bot. So what would Warren Buffett do? An educational tool. There's a disclaimer down here that's not actual financial advice. Uh, so you'd put in a prompt. The prompt I'm doing, should I invest in Apple long-term? And then I'll press analyze from Buffett's perspective. And it's going to take a second here to load. But um yeah, once again as this disclaimer uh this would be useful for someone who's trying to get advice on a stock because obviously some people need some advice because they don't understand what these ratios and different values mean. So when you look at this, it has the same uh ratios, price, all that stuff from the simple one. Then as a Buffett score, so business quality is rated at excellent, financial strength which is weak and then valuation is uh fair and then it has an overall which combines the 6.2 out of 10. Uh down here uh their quick verdict moderately appealing some Buffett criteria met others less clear. Less clear is down here. I'll get to that. Here's some analysis notes. The less clear part is this. The AI I've tried several times. It won't it I can't get it to do this analysis down here. So, it has a summary business quality mode. It will analyze all of this this stuff and like give the reasoning which is somewhat frustrating but uh that's one downfall of this app. Um other than that though you can to some extent trust these numbers because it's based on actual online data that they collected which is from the market. So it is a relatively trustworthy rating but obviously once again it's not actual financial advice so you have to figure it out on your own."
