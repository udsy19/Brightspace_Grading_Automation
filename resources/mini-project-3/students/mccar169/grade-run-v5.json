  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes and demonstrates a working financial tool: it was programmed to detect accounting discrepancies, ingests a real 10‑K, and produces a sourced red-flag report across financial categories. DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT evidence show intent and concrete features; REFLECT evidence shows successful execution and validation, meeting the criteria for a pass.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates clear, purposeful AI integration (tools used, persona, specific programmed checks) and produces structured, sourced outputs that add measurable value (fast red‑flag report for a 127‑page 10‑K). Evidence from Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages shows more than superficial use, meeting the PASS standard.",
