  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes a complete, functioning pipeline that ingests user profiles, normalizes financial data, applies decision guardrails, computes scenarios, and returns contextual advice—demonstrating an operational financial application (Discover + Implement). The Reflect stage confirms the outputs and code clarity, supporting that the tool performs the intended financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The submission describes a concrete, functional AI integration (OpenAI node) that ingests user data, normalizes inputs, applies guardrails, and produces structured and human-readable advice—demonstrating substantive value beyond superficial use. DISCOVER shows intent, IMPLEMENT provides technical evidence, and REFLECT confirms the AI-driven code and outputs, meeting the PASS standard.",
