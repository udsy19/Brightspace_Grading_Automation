  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a functioning financial application: it takes financial inputs, computes a concrete required return, and presents scenarios/recommendations. Implementation details and a worked example show the tool performs the stated financial tasks, meeting the PASS requirements.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates clear, functional AI integration: the model is core to the tool's output (realism assessment, scenarios, recommendations) and is invoked via a structured prompt and API call. The implementation and reflection evidence show the AI adds meaningful value beyond superficial use, satisfying the PASS standard.",
