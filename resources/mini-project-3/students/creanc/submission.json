  "transcript": "0:00 Hi, my name is Colin Crean and this is my mini project three on building an advanced AI finance tool. So for this, I built an AI investment analyst.\n0:14 And so how, in the past two projects, many projects we did, this analyst would have just given us the stock price.\n0:20 But where this one's different is it's going to analyze the stock and give us feedback about it. So I'll type in a stock like Nvidia, NVDA.\n0:29 And so we'll press right here to analyze the stock. And I have my open AI API key that I did.\n0:35 So as you can see, it gives us NVDA, gives us the stock price. It gives us the PDE ratio and the market cap.\n0:42 And we can see here over the past few days or about past month. And it gives us recent headlines. So NVIDIA, right?\n0:48 Reveals a new AI chips for data centers. Why NVIDIA's valuation might still be cheap. Competitors race to catch up to the CUDA dominance.\n0:56 And then so here, this is where the, the investment tool is different from, you know, the past two projects. It gives us an investment tool.\n1:04 Net analysis assessment. So here for the bull case, which would be, uh, like buying and increasing. So it says strong revenue growth.\n1:13 The company has demonstrated consistent top line expansion outspacing industry peers by significant market margin market leadership. NVIDIA maintains a dominant position in its core sector, providing a wide economic moat and innovation pipeline.\n1:27 Recent R and D investments suggest a robust production roadmap that could unlock a new revenue stream in the next eight months.\n1:32 And then it also gives a bear case for the stock price to plummet. Uh, valuation concerns trading at a P ratio of 95.2.\n1:40 The stock appears priced for perfection. Any earnings missed could trigger a sharp correction. Macro headwinds, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints pose a tangible risk margins to short term.\n1:52 In regulatory risk, increased scrutiny in the key markets could limit expansion opportunities to lead to costly litigation. And then it gives us a verdict.\n2:02 So the verdict is to buy. So based on the 95.2 PE ratio and the recent momentum, the risk-reward ratio, Profile favors the bulls.\n2:10 While the long-term thesis remains intact, caution is advised at these levels and accumulate on dips. So as you can see up here, this was my prompt that I provided it.\n2:20 So give me a smart investment thesis generator, all this stuff. So the data source, the AI logic where we use our open AI key right here, core features and workflow.\n2:32 So this is the code I used all throughout here or the prompt I used per se. And what I learned from this is that.\n2:40 Using this AI tool can be very helpful in it like this analysis, but you can't make a trade just based off this analysis and you have to go and do more research and get actual hard evidence.2:51 So thank you for listening."
