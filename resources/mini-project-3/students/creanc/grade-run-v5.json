  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly implements a functioning financial application—accepting a ticker, returning financial metrics, headlines, and a buy/sell assessment—showing concrete outputs and implementation details (Discover + Implement). The student also reflects sensibly on limitations (Reflect), indicating appropriate application and understanding beyond a superficial demo, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a working integration of AI (API/prompt) that produces substantive outputs (prices, ratios, headlines, bull/bear analysis, verdict) and a user workflow for inputting tickers, demonstrating the AI adds clear value. The student also reflected on limits, indicating a sound conceptual understanding rather than superficial use.",
