  "feedback": "Good application of DRIVER framework (demonstrated 4 stages). Consider strengthening the stages you didn't explicitly show.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student explicitly states they built a stock analysis agent and describes concrete financial outputs (quantitative/technical overview, price range, chart, news/sentiment, risk analysis, buy/sell synthesis), showing the tool performs financial tasks. Implement-stage details about ticker recognition and external data searches confirm it functions as a financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete AI integration—multiple AI components (chat model, stock tool, Tavly) are orchestrated to fetch tickers, quantitative data, news/sentiment and produce analysis outputs—showing functional, value-adding use rather than superficial mention. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear evidence of intent and execution, meeting the PASS standard.",
