  "transcript": "Okay. Hello, I'm Vincent Crawl. This is\nmy mini project three. So, I built a\nstock analysis agent. Um, so we'll go in\nthe chat. I already did one.\nWe'll just do it again. We'll input it.\nSo, we're going Tesla. And then while\nthat goes through, we can go and look at\num pretty much the prompts. Uh the\nsystem message. uh your it says uh your\npurpose is to provide a stock analysis\nby integrating quantitative data and\ncurrent sentiment/news\nand then it gives um step-by-step\ninformation on how to properly analyze\neverything uh using the AI tools I\nincluded in my agent. So it goes through\nand I gave it the now um command. So,\nit's currently like updating as we\nspeak. Um, and then like stock tools.\nUm, if we go or I don't know if I can go\nout of here, but there's another innate\nin workplace that has a stock tool\nthat's going out and it's searching um,\nbasically it's being able to take all of\nthe publicly traded um, companies and\nit's being able to go through AI chat\nmodel and it's recognizing what their\nabbreviation is and being able to pretty\nmuch put that in. And then it goes over\nto Tavly, uh, which is another AI agent\nkind of thing. Um, and it has its own\nlike search. So, it goes and searches\nall the recent news, sentiments,\neverything about it. And then I am\npretty sure it is\nready to go. Okay.\nOh, I spelled Tesla wrong. But, uh, it\nsays here's the latest based on Tesla's\nticker, which is TSLA. That's the\nabbreviation. And then it gives us quant\nquantitative and technical overview. So,\nstock price range past year. So, it's\nranging a lot. Um, it's near the top of\nthe range and it's closing around $450.\nUm, it's uptrend since mid 2024. And\nthen it gives a nice chart of the NASDAQ\nand the Tesla stock. Um and then it\ngives like the recent um news and\nsentiments like so China sales quarter 3\n2025\nall the competitions uh Tesla's facing\nwith China's EV vehicles uh stuff like\nthat in Europe all the insider sentiment\nthe market cap um there's a mega cap\nstock uh so there's strong trade volumes\nand then it gives you the synthesis so\nit's if it's bullish then uh you should\nbuy more and then\ngives you all the risk and the best\napproach for what you want to do with\nthe stock. Um, pretty much people who\nwould use this is anyone who like wants\nto invest. So, anyone could really use\nthis even if you're not um\nlike a day trader. I mean, day traders\ncould use it, too. I don't know if it\nwould be\nI mean, yeah, it would be good foranyone. Thank you,"
