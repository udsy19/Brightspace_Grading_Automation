  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The student clearly built a functioning financial tool that analyzes capital budgeting (NPV/IRR), implements it via an AI agent, and demonstrates multiple example outputs including approvals, rejections, and suspicious-data flags. Implementation and reflection evidence show the tool performs financial tasks and includes necessary guardrails, meeting PASS standards.\n- Integrate AI: The student demonstrates concrete AI integration (API use, structured outputs, sanity checks) and shows iterative improvement to address failures (gullibility → guardrails), plus explained how AI adds conversational value beyond calculation. These specifics across Discover, Implement, and Reflect meet the threshold for a thorough, effective AI integration.",
