  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission clearly describes a working workflow that extracts financial details from natural language, structures them as JSON, validates/cleans the output, and provides personalized financial advice. The Discover and Implement stages provide concrete, functional steps showing the tool performs financial tasks, meeting the criterion for a financial application.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates concrete, non-superficial AI integration: it uses a model to parse user text into structured JSON, then programmatically cleans and validates that output before producing personalized advice. The Discover and Implement stages provide clear, practical evidence that AI is embedded and adds functional value, meeting the PASS standard.",
