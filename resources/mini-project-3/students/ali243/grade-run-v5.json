  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The transcript shows a functioning workflow that accepts transaction inputs, processes costs/profit, and writes results to Google Sheets—demonstrating the tool performs financial tasks. Implementation evidence (loops and end-to-end flow) plus the stated goal and reflection support that the student built a working, if simple, financial application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integrate AI: The submission shows a working AI integration (an agent that parses inputs, uses memory, and logs to Google Sheets), so it adds value beyond a superficial demo. However the explanation and coverage are high-level and rudimentary with limited demonstration depth or multiple examples, meeting the standards for PARTIAL rather than a full PASS.",
