  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission demonstrates a working financial application with concrete financial computations (income/expense ratios, required monthly savings), live market data integration, and multiple example workflows showing feasibility outcomes. Discover/Implement/Reflect evidence shows conceptual motivation, implemented functionality, and reflective validation—meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integrate AI: The submission demonstrates substantive, effective AI integration with concrete components (LLM, live market API, JSON parsing), worked examples showing AI-generated analyses, and safety/UX considerations. The Implement and Reflect stages provide detailed evidence of value-added AI behavior (scenario generation, feasibility calculations, compliance), meeting the PASS standard.",

        "\"The financial advisor AI uses the Gemini chat model with my API key. The results populate here, going into detail and noting that the $80 dinner represents 53% of monthly income and 80% of disposable income. It calculates that 0.8 months of disposable income would be required. It even provides a savings model and financial feasibility criteria, classifying this purchase as 'moderate,' which is really detailed and nice.\"",

        "\"This one is much more in-depth. ... The HTTP Request node is the first advanced capability, connecting to the Frankfurter API for live currency exchange rates. ... The output shows the feasibility is 'Refused.' The monthly savings needed is $1,250, but the risk warning notes that current available savings of $450 is substantially less than the required amount.\""
