  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial APP: The submission describes and demonstrates a working financial application workflow: pulling earnings-report data, extracting key financial line items, and updating a spreadsheet (evidence above). Discover and Implement stages show both the problem framing and a functioning implementation, meeting the criterion that the tool performs financial tasks.\n- Integrate AI: The student shows a concrete, repeatable AI-enabled workflow that extracts structured financial data from filings and populates a spreadsheet, and lists specific fields extracted, demonstrating clear value beyond superficial use. Given the moderate evaluation standard (conceptual implementation acceptable), this meets the threshold for effective AI integration.",
