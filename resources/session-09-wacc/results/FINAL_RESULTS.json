You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains and applies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, capital weights, after‑tax cost of debt) with numeric computation, scenario analysis, validation, and peer comparison, demonstrating thorough understanding. Minor verbal slip about whether higher or lower WACC is preferable was corrected in reflection and does not undermine the comprehensive treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and applies the CAPM formula, computes a concrete cost-of-equity (11.65%), validates the arithmetic by hand, and tests sensitivity—demonstrating both conceptual understanding and correct application. These DRIVER stages show a thorough, practical treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax‑deductibility rationale, applies the after‑tax cost formula to the given bond yield (5.8% → 4.582%), and integrates that into the WACC calculation. They validated the arithmetic and tested sensitivity, demonstrating both conceptual understanding and correct numerical application consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student compared the WACC result to peer companies and an industry range and hand‑validated calculations, showing internal and some external awareness. However they did not name or cite specific external sources/tools used to benchmark (e.g., reports, databases, or calculators), so validation is present but not documented to the standard required for a full PASS.",

Implementation and reflection evidence (calculations, peer comparison, and recommendations) support a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs and produced a precise cost-of-equity (11.65%), then used project-specific adjustments (US and international) and integrated those results into WACC analysis and recommendations. Implementation and reflection evidence show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and explained the after-tax cost of debt (5.82% → ~4.58%) and explicitly linked interest deductibility to lower WACC, used sensitivity analysis to quantify tax-shield benefits, and made concrete recommendations—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct component values (CAPM equity, after‑tax debt) and a final WACC with sensitivity and application, demonstrating partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit, reproducible implementation details (no block‑by‑block methodology, code/run verification, or stepwise weight calculations), so the work cannot be fully validated—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student applied CAPM correctly (Rf 4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%) and used those inputs in downstream analysis, showing technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit, reproducible implementation details (no step‑by‑step calculation breakdown, code/run verification, or block‑level explanation of execution), so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided the market-value inputs (equity market cap and market debt) and reported the resulting weight (≈6.1%), indicating correct application.

Their DRIVER stages (Define/Discover, Implement, Reflect) show both correct methodology and thoughtful treatment of assumptions, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and applies the CAPM formula, provides numeric inputs and a computed cost of equity, and uses alternate betas for project-specific analyses while reflecting on assumption choices. These demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% yield × (1−21%) ≈ 4.5%), incorporates the tax shield into WACC calculations, and demonstrates its impact via a debt-issuance sensitivity analysis. They also reflect on how rising leverage would affect borrowing costs, showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies the WACC formula, reports component values and a final WACC, and ran calculations in Python (Implement).

This explicit, actionable linkage satisfies the strict Evolve requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides explicit, actionable insights on optimal capital structure (recommend increasing debt, specific debt-range targets) and recognizes trade-offs (lower cost vs. credit-risk). Those clear reflections satisfy the strict requirement for the Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic conceptual grasp (recognizes WACC, that debt is cheaper, and that leverage affects WACC) and provides numeric estimates and recommendations, but fails to present a clear WACC formula, component breakdown (cost of equity, explicit weights, tax-adjusted cost of debt), or coherent calculations.

While the student conceptually discusses equity being costly and gives WACC-like percentages, the specific Cost of Equity (CAPM) calculation is missing, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic awareness that debt has an after-tax cost and that debt can be cheaper (conceptually implying a tax benefit), and provides numeric estimates, but does not show a clear after-tax cost calculation or quantify the tax shield (no tax rate or formula applied).

Multiple concrete examples and computed values show strong mastery beyond a brief or superficial discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, specific understanding of CAPM: they state the formulaic approach, provide numerical CAPM inputs (beta, rf, MRP), validate the method, and apply adjusted betas to produce project-specific rates. These concrete inputs, validation, and application meet the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes the after-tax adjustment and tax shield rationale, validated the formulaic treatment, and applied it in a simulation that produced a measurable WACC reduction. These concrete inputs, validation, and applied example demonstrate a thorough, correct treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports correct components and numerical WACC outputs and says they validated formulas and ran Python—evidence of technical implementation. However, they do not provide explicit, block-by-block code explanation, show the actual implementation, or demonstrate ownership/detail required by the STRICT rubric (no function-level description or reproduced code snippets).

However, the submission lacks strict, explicit evidence required here—no code snippets, block-by-block explanation, or clear verification steps demonstrating ownership—so it does not meet the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly lists market-value inputs (equity market cap and debt) and states they used market-value weights and executed the calculation in Python, showing correct intent and partial technical implementation.

This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit, defendable problem definition and decision context.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly uses WACC as the baseline hurdle rate for a $5B capital project, adjusts the hurdle for higher project risk, and links capital‑structure changes to firm‑value implications. This demonstrates clear recognition of WACC applications in both capital budgeting and valuation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a concrete financing recommendation (target debt ratio) and explains the economic rationale (tax shield lowers WACC and raises firm value), tying analysis to strategy. This explicit, actionable insight satisfies the Reflect criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies key WACC components (weights, after‑tax cost of debt, cost of equity via their code) and computes a numeric WACC and strategic implication, showing functional understanding. However the treatment is not thorough: cost of equity calculation and explicit formulas/derivations are not shown, numeric reporting is inconsistent, and deeper justification (e.g., sensitivity or explicit CAPM math) is missing — so the work is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs (beta, risk-free, market premium) and reports running a calculation, showing conceptual and implementation understanding. However the submission omits the explicit CAPM formula, the numeric cost-of-equity result, and supporting derivation or justification, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the tax shield concept and applies the after‑tax debt formula to get a numeric result and links it to capital structure strategy, showing conceptual and implementation understanding. However the presentation contains a numeric/notation inconsistency and lacks detailed derivation, sensitivity analysis, or explicit stepwise calculation, so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",

The combination of formula representation, coded implementation, and validation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly presents and implements the after‑tax cost of debt formula, computes the numeric after‑tax rate (5.8%*(1–0.21)=4.58%), incorporates it into WACC, and interprets the tax‑shield/leveraging effect on WACC and financing strategy. This applied, validated treatment demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performs limited sensitivity checks (one incremental debt scenario and two project‑beta cases) and implements/prints results, showing understanding that WACC responds to capital structure and beta. However, this is not a thorough sensitivity analysis (no ranges, tornado table, or systematic parameter sweep), so the work demonstrates partial but incomplete coverage of the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly cross‑checks results against industry ranges and peer company figures and interprets those comparisons, showing validation effort. However, they do not cite external sources or tools used to verify peer/industry numbers (only restate provided context), so validation is present but not externally documented—hence PARTIAL.",

Evidence from Implement and Reflect stages shows both computational use and economic interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines WACC as the project hurdle, calculates numeric WACC values, applies them to project decisions (US projects use firm WACC; international projects use WACC + risk premium), and draws investment recommendations based on those thresholds. This combination of calculation, application to examples, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly built an automated implementation (Colab notebook), represented model components in code, executed the calculations and reported numeric outputs used in analysis and recommendation. This demonstrates practical automation of WACC calculations sufficient for a PASS under the moderate integration standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, reports an explicit numeric cost of equity, and integrates it into the WACC computation, showing correct conceptual use.

Coverage is applied and specific rather than merely cursory, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported a pre-tax and an explicit after-tax cost of debt, executed scenario analysis showing WACC falling with more debt, and explicitly attributed the effect to the tax shield—demonstrating both calculation and interpretation.

Minor label/inconsistency issues in wording (e.g., mixed notation for weights vs. rates, slight debt-yield mentions) do not undermine the clear, comprehensive understanding and application shown.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies pre‑tax debt yield, applies the tax rate to obtain the after‑tax cost (5.8% → 4.58%), and uses that value in WACC computations and leverage sensitivity analysis, showing both conceptual and applied understanding of the tax shield. Coverage is specific and applied, satisfying a thorough treatment for this moderate criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates both conceptual understanding (includes the (1−TC) tax shield term and explains its role) and applied calculation (uses a 21% tax rate on a 5.8% pre‑tax yield to produce a 4.58% after‑tax cost and uses it in WACC and recommendations). Coverage is specific, numeric, and integrated into analysis, satisfying a thorough treatment for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and supplies CAPM inputs (rf, MRP, beta) and attempts to compute cost of equity within the WACC implementation, showing procedural understanding. However, they do not explicitly show the CAPM calculation or report the resulting cost-of-equity value, and there is a labeling/numbering inconsistency (e.g., \"WE is 6.1%\" appears incorrect given the stated capital values). These gaps and small errors mean the treatment is correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports the formula and final WACC values and says they ran code, but provides no block‑by‑block explanation of the implementation, no explicit CAPM/cost‑of‑equity calculation shown, and contains ambiguous/inconsistent intermediate values (e.g., \"WE is 6.1%\"). Under the STRICT technical implementation standard requiring explicit personal execution and detailed code understanding, the evidence is insufficient, so the criterion fails.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student names CAPM inputs and claims to have run code, they do not show the CAPM formula application, the explicit cost‑of‑equity calculation, nor any block‑by‑block code explanation or personal verification required by the STRICT technical standard. Because explicit implementation details, code walkthrough, and ownership are missing, the submission fails this criterion.",

These elements across the Represent and Implement stages show strong mastery beyond a basic discussion, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains and justifies CAPM inputs, shows the representational step to compute cost of equity, and reports the correct numerical CAPM result (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%). The work applies the cost of equity in subsequent WACC calculation and interpretation, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and justifies inputs (5.8% yield, 21% tax), shows the representational step to compute after-tax cost, and reports the correct numeric result (5.8%×(1−0.21)=4.58%).

This shows correct understanding, implementation, and interpretation consistent with a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly used CAPM inputs and reported a computed cost of equity (11.65%), indicating they executed an implementation and applied it in WACC. However, they did not provide explicit block-by-block explanation of the CAPM function, nor a clear statement of personally running and verifying code stepwise, so the evidence supports a correct but not fully explicit technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market values (equity and debt), computed market-value weights and reported numeric results and a verification check, demonstrating correct application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution or block-by-block methodology (no \"I ran this code\" or function-level explanations), so the implementation is correct but not fully explicit — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed a clear sensitivity scenario (current vs. +$3B debt) and reported numeric WACC changes, demonstrating applied sensitivity to capital-structure input. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide broad multi-input sensitivity sweeps, nor explicit block-by-block execution or a personal \"I ran and verified\" statement, so the evidence supports a correct but limited/partially explicit sensitivity analysis.",

These elements constitute a comprehensive, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM (rf + beta·MRP) to compute cost of equity (11.65%) and demonstrates additional, consistent examples for project-specific betas (11.10% and 12.75%). Use of hand calculation, Python validation, and explicit reflection on assumptions shows thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), demonstrates the tax‑shield impact numerically (WACC declines with more debt, explicit examples including +$3B and sensitivity to 20% debt), and validates results with code. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes all WACC components (CAPM equity, after‑tax debt, market weights) and runs/validates Python outputs, showing partial technical execution. Because this is a STRICT criterion, the submission falls short: there is verification but no explicit, block‑by‑block code explanation or clear ownership of the implementation, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually, produced numeric results, and validated code against hand calculations, showing partial technical execution. Because this is a STRICT technical criterion and the submission lacks explicit, block‑level code explanation and full ownership of the implementation (AI‑generated code not explained line‑by‑line), the score is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values, computed explicit weights (200/(200+13) ≈ 93.7%, 13/213 ≈ 6.1%) and validated results with code and manual checks.

They also reflect on appropriate application (project-specific discounting) and strategic implications, meeting the moderate standard for thorough conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated WACC values and explicitly addressed using WACC as a hurdle rate, noting it should be adjusted by project risk rather than applied universally. This demonstrates applied understanding and appropriate decision-making guidance, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the problem and scope, enumerated the necessary inputs for the cost-of-capital calculation, and linked the analysis to a specific financing decision (increase debt ratio). This explicit framing satisfies the Define & Discover requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student produced a concrete cost-of-equity value and used it in the WACC calculation (Implement), showing understanding that equity cost is required. However, there is no explicit CAPM formula, inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market premium), or discussion of how the equity cost was derived, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports a clear after-tax cost-of-debt value and used debt/corporate tax inputs in the WACC calculation, showing basic correct application of the tax shield. However, they do not show the pre-tax cost, the tax rate or the formula (rd*(1–Tc)) or discuss the tax-shield mechanics, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an after-tax cost of debt and included corporate tax as an input, indicating basic application of the tax shield. However, they did not show the tax-shield formula (rd*(1–Tc)), pre-tax cost or explain how interest deductibility reduces effective cost, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

They also perform validation checks and interpret implications, showing thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the MODERATE standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC as the investment hurdle, computes numeric WACC values, and applies them to decision-making (including project-specific adjustments and peer checks). This shows a clear, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under the MODERATE standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student implemented an automated WACC calculator (code present, inputs fed, outputs produced) and used it to run a leverage scenario with numeric results, demonstrating practical integration of finance and technology. They also outline sensible extensions, indicating meaningful automation rather than purely manual calculation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies a CAPM-based cost of equity (numeric result used in WACC) and recognizes adjustments (beta, country premium). However, the submission lacks a clear breakdown of CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, explicit beta) and deeper sensitivity/examples, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculates and applies the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% pre-tax → 4.582% after tax) and uses it in WACC computations, demonstrating correct procedural use. However, discussion of the tax-shield benefit is brief and lacks deeper analysis (e.g., marginal cost of debt, changing credit risk, or explicit quantification of the tax shield), so the treatment is accurate but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies interest deductibility by converting pre-tax debt (5.8%) to an after-tax cost (4.582%) and uses it in WACC calculations, showing procedural understanding. However, they offer only brief interpretation and no deeper discussion of the tax-shield mechanics, valuation impact, or sensitivity to changing tax rates/credit risk, so the treatment is accurate but not thorough.",

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC formula and its components (weights, cost of equity via CAPM, after‑tax cost of debt) and implements them with numeric examples and a sensitivity analysis. Reflection on assumptions and tradeoffs (tax shield vs. rising distress costs) demonstrates depth and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements CAPM, provides numeric inputs and a computed cost of equity (11.665%), and demonstrates applied sensitivity (changing beta) and reflection on implications. This shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax cost‑of‑debt formula, computes the numeric after‑tax rate (~4.58%), implements it in code, and explains the tax shield's effect on WACC while acknowledging limits (financial distress). This thorough, applied treatment meets PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implemented CAPM conceptually, provided inputs, and ran code producing a numerical cost‑of‑equity, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not provide block‑by‑block explanation or explicit ownership of code (they relied on Gemini for code generation and gave only a high‑level description), so the strict technical standard for full PASS is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies clear market‑value numbers and uses them in the implemented WACC calculation (partial technical execution). However, they do not explicitly show how those market values were determined or sourced (no calculation, data source, or block‑by‑block justification), nor full ownership/detail required by the strict standard, so the result is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly planned, implemented, ran, and interpreted a sensitivity analysis (debt sweep and plotted WACC), showing correct execution and reflection. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block explanations or full ownership of the AI‑generated code (relied on Gemini without detailed walkthrough), so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

However, they do not explicitly discuss WACC's role in valuation (e.g., DCF discounting or firm valuation) beyond peer benchmarking, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",

Minor input inconsistencies exist, but the depth and multiple applications satisfy PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies CAPM components (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium), computes a numeric cost-of-equity, and applies it to WACC and peer comparisons—demonstrating applied, thorough understanding. Minor input inconsistencies are present but do not undermine the clear, substantive CAPM use, meeting PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies pre-tax yields and the corporate tax rate, computes an after‑tax cost of debt and explicitly notes the tax-shield benefit by showing the WACC decline when debt increases. Minor numeric mismatches exist, but the submission demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its effect on WACC, meeting PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: This is a STRICT technical criterion; although correct numeric components appear, the student explicitly relied on an AI tool and declined to show personal implementation or stepwise verification. Because they did not demonstrate ownership, code/step execution, or explicit methodological validation required by the rubric, the submission fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal implementation, stepwise methodology, and verification. Although a CAPM numeric result is presented, the student defers to Gemini, provides no executed code or detailed walkthrough, and shows input inconsistencies—therefore failing to meet required explicit demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal execution, stepwise methodology, and verification.

You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, numerically supported understanding of WACC components and calculation: they state correct formulas (CAPM and after-tax debt), use market values for weighting, compute and interpret numeric WACC results, and run a pro-forma sensitivity. They also acknowledge model limitations and necessary adjustments (Hamada, rating effects), meeting the criteria for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, selects and documents inputs (Rf, beta, MRP), computes a numeric cost of equity (~11.6%), and integrates it into the WACC model. They also critique assumptions and propose appropriate refinements (Hamada re-levering), demonstrating a thorough, operational understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax debt formula, uses concrete inputs (5.8% pre-tax yield, tax rate) and computes an after-tax cost (~4.6%), integrates it into the WACC, and quantifies the tax-shield benefit (WACC ↓ ~9.2 bps).
