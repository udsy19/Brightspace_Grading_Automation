  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied core WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax debt cost, market-value weights) and produced a numerical WACC with comparative context and leverage effects. Coverage is specific, applied to a real example, and includes implications—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the CAPM formula, provided the risk-free rate, beta, and market risk premium, and produced the numerically correct cost of equity (11.65%) with an appropriate interpretation of beta — demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated the after-tax cost of debt using the stated bond yield and tax rate, noted interest is tax-deductible, and applied the result to financing decisions and WACC—demonstrating correct computation and clear understanding of the tax-shield benefit. This specific numeric application plus the discussion of implications satisfies the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed a limited sensitivity check (one debt-addition scenario) and interpreted its effect, showing partial competency. However, they did not run systematic sensitivity across multiple key inputs (beta, RF, MRP, Rd, tax) or present explicit stepwise/quantitative ranges or code, so the strict requirement for a thorough sensitivity analysis is unmet.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission shows manual calculation and conceptual scenario analysis but contains no explicit evidence of automation (no code, spreadsheet, tool, or automated process described). Because the criterion requires demonstration of any automation, the lack of explicit automation means it fails.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student executed a clear, stepwise WACC calculation using stated inputs (CAPM, after-tax Rd, market-value weights) and ran one sensitivity scenario (+$3B debt), demonstrating systematic implementation. However, the sensitivity work is limited (single scenario, no multi-parameter ranges, tables, or quantified sensitivity outputs), so it falls short of a full PASS.",
