  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a clear, correct statement of the WACC formula and applies its components (CAPM for equity, after‑tax debt, market-value weights) with worked calculations and comparative analysis, plus consideration of project-specific adjustments and peer benchmarks. This thorough, applied treatment meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM formula, supplied appropriate inputs, performed the arithmetic yielding 11.65%, and applied the result within the WACC and project-risk discussion. The treatment is accurate, numeric, and extended to practical adjustments (project-specific beta), meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, computed the numeric result (4.58%), and integrated it into WACC calculations. They also explicitly discussed the tax-shield benefit and its impact on WACC and strategy, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission relies on AI-generated outputs and asserts code usage but never shows explicit personal execution, block-level explanation, or ownership as required by the strict technical standard. Because the student did not demonstrate running/verifying the code or explain the implementation details step‑by‑step, it fails the explicit demonstration requirement.\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed a basic sensitivity check (base case and one alternate debt issuance) and discussed qualitative adjustments (higher beta for international projects), showing partial sensitivity analysis. However, they did not present systematic multi‑input sensitivity, range analyses, or explicit code execution/block-level verification required by the strict technical standard, so the result is PARTIAL.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly indicates they used automation (Gemini prompt and Python/Colab) and leveraged its outputs in their analysis, but the submission provides no explicit code, execution evidence, or explanation of the automation flow. That demonstrates partial integration of finance and technology but lacks the explicit demonstration/detail required for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a logical, quantitative argument for increasing debt (tax-shield benefit, numeric WACC reduction, cheaper after‑tax debt vs equity) and explicitly acknowledges the primary downside (credit-rating/financial‑risk limit) as the stopping condition. That balanced, applied treatment of trade‑offs meets the criterion for PASS."

The student ties calculations to strategy and summarizes conclusions, meeting the standard for a passing presentation."
