  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the problem scope and objectives, enumerated the specific inputs required to compute WACC, and articulated a financing decision based on the analysis. This explicit framing, input identification, and decision linkage satisfies the Define & Discover criterion at the required standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly mapped capital-structure components (equity market cap, debt, tax rate, costs of equity and debt) into the WACC framework and described the weighting and formulaic steps, demonstrating a complete representation. While some numeric reporting issues exist, the conceptual framework and mapping are explicit and satisfy the Represent requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly recognizes and explains WACC's role in capital budgeting and valuation (project-specific WACC, risk drivers, and decision impacts) and applies that insight to a financing recommendation, demonstrating clear evolution from analysis to strategic application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates correct conceptual understanding of WACC components and the calculation steps (CAPM for equity, after-tax debt, market-value weights) and applies them, but the submission contains numeric inconsistencies (e.g., weights that do not sum to 1 and implausible magnitude labels) and limited verification of results. These gaps mean the treatment is correct but not fully thorough, so PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs and reports a computed cost of equity, showing conceptual understanding and application (DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT). However, they do not show the actual formula application, input values or intermediate math, so treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies an after-tax cost of debt and cites the benefit of cheaper debt in reducing WACC, showing conceptual correctness (IMPLEMENT/DISCOVER). However, treatment lacks depth—no explicit formula derivation for the after-tax calculation or an explicit tax-shield quantification—so the work is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",
