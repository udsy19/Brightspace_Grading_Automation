  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains and applies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, capital weights, after‑tax cost of debt) with numeric computation, scenario analysis, validation, and peer comparison, demonstrating thorough understanding. Minor verbal slip about whether higher or lower WACC is preferable was corrected in reflection and does not undermine the comprehensive treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and applies the CAPM formula, computes a concrete cost-of-equity (11.65%), validates the arithmetic by hand, and tests sensitivity—demonstrating both conceptual understanding and correct application. These DRIVER stages show a thorough, practical treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax‑deductibility rationale, applies the after‑tax cost formula to the given bond yield (5.8% → 4.582%), and integrates that into the WACC calculation. They validated the arithmetic and tested sensitivity, demonstrating both conceptual understanding and correct numerical application consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student compared the WACC result to peer companies and an industry range and hand‑validated calculations, showing internal and some external awareness. However they did not name or cite specific external sources/tools used to benchmark (e.g., reports, databases, or calculators), so validation is present but not documented to the standard required for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains how debt's tax shield lowers WACC, ran concrete scenario(s) showing the effect of additional debt, and provided a reasoned recommendation (debt issuance and buybacks) with explicit acknowledgement of the financial stability tradeoff. This combination of conceptual rationale, numerical experimentation, and risk awareness demonstrates a logical, well‑presented treatment of capital‑structure trade‑offs."
