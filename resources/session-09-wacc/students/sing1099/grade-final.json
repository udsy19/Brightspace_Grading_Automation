Coverage is specific, applied, and includes implications (hurdle rate, leverage effects), meeting the standard for a thorough conceptual and applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the CAPM formula with explicit inputs (rf, market premium, beta), computes the cost of equity (11.65%), and uses it in scenario analysis—demonstrating a complete, applied understanding consistent with a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the pre‑tax debt rate, explains the tax‑deductibility/tax shield, computes an after‑tax cost (4.58%) consistent with those inputs, and applies it in WACC scenarios showing the impact of debt — demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The numerical WACC components and result are consistent and correctly applied (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, weighting), showing correct calculation. However, under the STRICT technical standard the student did not provide explicit personal execution details or block‑by‑block explanation of the code/functions, so they meet the calculation correctness but fall short on the required explicit technical implementation—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies CAPM inputs and reports a consistent computed cost of equity (11.65%), demonstrating correct conceptual and numerical implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block code explanation, or ownership of the run/verification steps, so the implementation is correct but not fully documented—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies explicit market-value figures for equity and debt and states that weights are applied to compute WACC, demonstrating the correct conceptual approach. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show personal execution, block‑by‑block code explanations, or explicit verification of the weighting calculations, so the implementation is correct but not fully documented.",
