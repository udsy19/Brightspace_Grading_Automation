  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC concept, cites the V = E + D formula, computes specific WACC outcomes for scenarios, and interprets effects of debt (tax shield) and peer comparisons. Coverage is applied and substantive across stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect), meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate-evaluation category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates WACC and runs investment scenarios, then uses those results to assess project-specific hurdle rates (US vs international) and make actionable recommendations, demonstrating applied understanding. Multiple examples and reflection across DRIVER stages show thorough treatment appropriate for a PASS in this moderate-evaluation category.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the cost-of-capital problem and tests financing options (investing 3B/5B), shows computed WACC outcomes, and draws a clear Netflix financing recommendation; these concrete Define & Discover actions satisfy the strict requirement for explicit demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student discusses WACC and qualitatively mentions cost of equity differences, but provides no CAPM formula, inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market premium), or explicit calculation of cost of equity. Because the assignment criterion requires calculating equity cost using CAPM and that is absent, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-shield rationale qualitatively and shows how increased debt lowers WACC in scenario outputs, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not present the after-tax cost of debt formula (kd*(1–Tc), tax rate) or numeric calculation of debt’s after-tax cost, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-shield concept qualitatively and applies it to scenario results showing WACC reduction, demonstrating conceptual understanding and application. However, they do not provide the formal after-tax cost-of-debt expression (kd*(1–Tc) ) or numeric tax-shield calculations, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.",

        "\"So obviously the first step is going to be determining our current WACC which if we head over to Google Collab we solved and given our current debt and equity we are looking at a weighted average cost of capital of 11.22% which is above the industry average.\"",
        "\"you see this is the formula in V is the sum of the market value of equity and the market value of debt.\"",
        "\"This just goes to show how important it is to take advantage of the tax shield effect and take on more debt and less equity because your lenders are lenders have less risk.\""

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Clearly framed the task (determine current WACC and test investment scenarios).\n- Implement: Presented computed outputs and scenario results (11.22% → 11.13% → 11.07%, weights 92.59%/7.41%).\n- Reflect: Interpreted results (tax-shield rationale), compared peers, and offered financing recommendations.",
      "reasoning": "The video transcript communicates the WACC methodology conceptually, supplies numeric examples and scenario outcomes, links mechanics (V = E + D, weights) to implications (tax shield, lower WACC with more debt), and draws clear recommendations; this combination of explanation, examples, and interpretation demonstrates an effective presentation of understanding."
