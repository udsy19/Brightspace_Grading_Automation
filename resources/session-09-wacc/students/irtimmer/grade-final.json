  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, accurate treatment of WACC: clear formulation of cost of equity (CAPM), choice and rationale for market-value weights, correct after‑tax cost of debt, and numeric blending with scenario analysis showing WACC change. These specific explanations and calculations across Discover, Represent, and Implement stages meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, justifies its use, provides the specific inputs (risk‑free rate, beta, market premium), computes the cost of equity (11.65%), and applies it in the WACC calculation. This depth of explanation plus numeric application across DRIVER stages meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-deductibility rationale, states the inputs (5.8% yield, 21% tax), computes the after‑tax cost of debt (4.58%), and applies it in the WACC/scenario analysis. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric example, and implementation meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performs a concrete scenario sensitivity (adding $3B debt) with numeric WACC outcomes and implements it in Python, demonstrating partial technical execution. However the work shows only a single scenario and lacks broader, explicit sensitivity sweeps, block‑level verification statements (\"I ran and verified...\"), or multiple input ranges required by the strict criterion, so it meets PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compares their WACC to industry averages and a peer company, demonstrating external benchmarking. However, they do not cite specific external sources, datasets, or tools used to obtain the industry/peer figures, so the validation is substantive but lacks the required source citation for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly recommends increasing leverage and cites quantitative evidence (WACC reduction and peer comparison) to support the financing strategy, showing applied reflection. However, the treatment omits explicit discussion of countervailing factors (financial distress costs, covenant/ratings impact, marginal cost of debt at higher leverage), so the insight is actionable but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

        "\"To determine this, I have applied the driver framework to calculate our weighted average cost of capital or WACC.\"",
        "\"Moving to the represent phase of the driver framework, we map these inputs to our valuation formulas.\"",
        "\"Our overall WACC drops from 11.22% to 11.13%.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the decision and inputs; Represent — explained mapping of inputs to CAPM, after‑tax debt, and WACC; Implement — described Python model and variable definitions and walked through numeric outputs; Validate/Evolve — compared to industry peers and applied WACC to the $5bn decision and financing recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The presentation is well‑structured and clearly follows the DRIVER flow: it defines the problem, explains methodology, implements and walks through numerical results, validates against peers, and draws actionable recommendations. The transcript shows coherent explanation, worked examples, and use of automation, meeting the criterion for an effective demonstration."
