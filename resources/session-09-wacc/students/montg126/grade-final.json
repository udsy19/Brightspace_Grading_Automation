  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC formula components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), implements and verifies calculations, and applies scenarios with numeric results and interpretation. This coverage is thorough and includes examples and strategic implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states use of CAPM, provides the key inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, beta) and reports a calculated cost of equity (11.65%), then applies it in WACC scenarios and interpretation. This demonstrates correct, applied understanding beyond a brief mention, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes calculating after-tax cost of debt, uses the bond yield and tax rate to compute a numeric after-tax cost (4.58%), and applies it in a scenario that demonstrates the tax-shield reducing WACC. This shows correct understanding, implementation, and interpretation consistent with a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly used CAPM inputs and reported a computed cost of equity (11.65%), indicating they executed an implementation and applied it in WACC. However, they did not provide explicit block-by-block explanation of the CAPM function, nor a clear statement of personally running and verifying code stepwise, so the evidence supports a correct but not fully explicit technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market values (equity and debt), computed market-value weights and reported numeric results and a verification check, demonstrating correct application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution or block-by-block methodology (no \"I ran this code\" or function-level explanations), so the implementation is correct but not fully explicit — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed a clear sensitivity scenario (current vs. +$3B debt) and reported numeric WACC changes, demonstrating applied sensitivity to capital-structure input. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide broad multi-input sensitivity sweeps, nor explicit block-by-block execution or a personal \"I ran and verified\" statement, so the evidence supports a correct but limited/partially explicit sensitivity analysis.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (framed Netflix financing context and inputs), Implement (ran the +$3B debt scenario and reported WACC effects), Reflect/Evolve (proposed a target debt-to-value, explained tax-shield benefit and strategic implications).",
      "reasoning": "The student logically presents the basic trade-off—underutilized tax shield vs. potential credit/risk concerns—quantifies a target leverage and shows the WACC benefit, demonstrating correct conceptual reasoning. However, the treatment is not fully thorough: it lacks deeper analysis of downside trade-offs (e.g., how higher leverage affects borrowing spreads, default risk, or equity cost) and detailed quantitative sensitivity on those risks, so the score is PARTIAL."

      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, structured walkthrough: it states objectives, lists inputs, explains methodology (CAPM, after-tax debt, market-value weights), runs scenarios, reports numeric outputs, and draws actionable recommendations. Delivery is informal but the content is coherent and demonstrates solid understanding, meeting the PASS standard."
