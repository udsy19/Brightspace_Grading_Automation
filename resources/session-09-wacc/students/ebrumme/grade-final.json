  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, correct description of the WACC formula and its components (CAPM for equity, after-tax debt, market-value weights, V=E+D), implements the calculation in code, and reports concrete results and implications for project decisions. This coverage is thorough and applied, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes the after-tax cost-of-debt adjustment and explicitly uses a 21% tax rate, implements the calculation in code, and connects the tax-shield benefit to lowering WACC and an actionable leverage target. This shows both conceptual understanding and applied implementation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes interest deductibility (after-tax cost of debt), uses a concrete tax rate (21%), implements the adjustment in code, and connects the tax-shield benefit to reduced WACC and a leverage recommendation. This shows correct conceptual understanding and applied implementation, meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and describes CAPM as the method for cost of equity and uses relevant inputs (risk-free rate, market premium) and code to compute results, showing conceptual and implementation understanding. However, the treatment lacks depth: the transcript does not show the explicit beta used or a clear numeric cost-of-equity result or derivation, so the coverage is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates correct components and an implemented calculation with numeric results (Represent/Implement/Validate), showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT requirement they do not explicitly show personal code execution, block-by-block explanation, or explicit ownership/verifications (no detailed walkthrough of functions, specific beta or intermediate numeric values), so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal execution, show block-level explanations, and verify outputs. The transcript only states they used CAPM and ran code (claims) but provides no explicit \"I ran this code,\" no code excerpts or stepwise explanation of the CAPM implementation (beta, rf, market premium, computed r_e), and no ownership details—therefore it fails the criterion.",
