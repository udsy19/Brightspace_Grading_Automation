  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and applies the CAPM and WACC formulas (including the 1–tax tax shield and definitions of E, D, V, t), computes numerical component costs and weights, performs a debt-issuance scenario, and interprets the impact. Coverage is detailed and includes examples, calculations, and implications, satisfying the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the CAPM formula with given inputs, computed a specific cost of equity (11.65%), integrated it into the WACC calculation, and discussed its implications. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the after-tax cost-of-debt formula (RD*(1–t)), computed a specific after-tax rate (4.582%), incorporated it into the WACC model, and discussed the tax-shield benefit and strategic implications. This demonstrates thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed all WACC components correctly and produced concrete numeric results, demonstrating technical understanding of the formula. However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, nor provide block-by-block explanation or ownership of the code (they attribute code to Google Gemini), so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly stated and applied CAPM and produced a concrete cost-of-equity result, showing understanding of the method. However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard they did not demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code understanding, or ownership of the implementation (attributing the code to Google Gemini), so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified market-value components and showed the numeric calculation (E=200B, D=13B, V=213B) and derived weights, demonstrating technical correctness. However, under the STRICT implementation requirement they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code understanding, or ownership of the implementation (they attributed the code to an AI and did not walk through it), so the work merits PARTIAL.",
