  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied WACC components (CAPM inputs, debt yield and after‑tax cost, market‑value weights) and produced numeric WACC results and sensitivity analysis, demonstrating depth and application. Their use of code to compute and compare scenarios plus reflective interpretation shows a thorough, working understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identified a clear cost‑of‑debt input (5.8% yield), specified the corporate tax rate (21%) and planned/implemented an after‑tax debt calculation in code, then demonstrated the tax‑shield effect by quantifying the WACC change and discussing sensitivity. This shows correct and applied understanding of after‑tax cost of debt and its benefit, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly recognized interest deductibility (tax shield), used the corporate tax rate to compute after‑tax debt cost in code, and demonstrated the quantitative impact (WACC decline and sensitivity plot). Their implementation plus reflective discussion shows a correct and applied understanding of the tax‑shield effect, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified CAPM inputs and implemented the cost‑of‑equity calculation in code and applied it to WACC and project adjustments, showing correct conceptual use. However, the transcript does not show an explicit numeric cost‑of‑equity calculation or stepwise derivation in the narrative, so the treatment is correct but not thoroughly documented, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented code, ran it in Colab, and produced/validated numeric WACC outputs and sensitivity analysis, showing partial technical execution. However, they did not provide the required explicit block‑by‑block explanation, in‑depth walkthrough of the implementation, or a clear ownership statement of the code logic (no detailed function/line‑level explanation), so the strict technical standard is only partially met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student identified CAPM inputs and produced numeric outputs via Python/Colab, showing functional implementation. However, they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block explanations, an ownership statement (\"I ran and verified...\"), or a detailed walkthrough of the CAPM code, which the strict technical standard requires for a PASS; thus PARTIAL.",

        "\"Hi Dr. Zhang, how are you? My name is Tomas Gomez and this is my session 9 assignment uh cost of capital analysis.\"",
        "\"my plan to carry out this this analysis this assignment is uh before coding uh compute the cost of equity using the capital asset pricing model and compute the after tax cost of depth.\"",
        "\"the biggest thing I learned honestly is how sensitive WACC is to capital structure\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "Discover: clearly stated the objective and key question (WACC for $5B content decision).  \nRepresent/Implement: described a stepwise plan and that code was generated and run in Colab to compute inputs, WACC, and sensitivity.  \nReflect: interpreted results and stated what was learned about capital structure sensitivity.",
      "reasoning": "The student delivered a coherent, structured spoken walkthrough: introduced the problem, listed inputs and methodology, reported quantitative outputs (WACC figures and sensitivity), and reflected on implications. While conversational with filler words, the presentation effectively communicated understanding and findings, meeting the criterion for an effective video presentation."
