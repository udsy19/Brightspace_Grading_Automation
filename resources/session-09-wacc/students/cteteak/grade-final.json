  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains WACC components and uses CAPM for cost of equity, adjusts debt for taxes, applies market-value weights, and produces numeric WACC results with scenario analysis and validation. The treatment is comprehensive, includes supporting calculations and project-specific nuance, meeting the rubric's requirements for a thorough demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained CAPM, specified all inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, beta), computed the numeric cost of equity (2.5% + 1.2*6% = 9.7%), and integrated it into WACC calculations and scenario analysis. This is a thorough, applied treatment consistent with a PASS under the moderate evaluation standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after‑tax cost of debt (4.5% × (1−21%) = 3.55%), explained interest tax deductibility, and applied it in scenario analysis showing the WACC reduction and strategic recommendation to increase debt to capture the tax shield. This is a thorough, applied treatment consistent with PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides correct inputs, component calculations, a numeric WACC, and states they used and validated Python code, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not explicitly show personal execution steps, block‑by‑block code explanation, or clear ownership/verifications (e.g., \"I ran this and this function does X\"), so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states CAPM inputs and the resulting cost of equity (2.5% + 1.2×6% = 9.7%) and indicates use of a Python implementation and validation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate running the code, provide block‑by‑block explanations, or clearly assert personal ownership/verification of the implementation, so the work is only partially meeting the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides specific market‑value numbers and uses them to compute 90%/10% weights and applies those in WACC, with a stated Python implementation and validation—so the basic technical result is present. However, under the STRICT rubric they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, show the code or block‑by‑block explanation, or document how market values were sourced/calculated, so the implementation is only partially demonstrated.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (framed financing question), Represent/Implement (calculated WACC and modeled increased debt scenario), Reflect/Evolve (compared peers and gave a concrete leverage recommendation).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly links capital structure to WACC, cites tax‑shield benefits, models a leverage scenario, and benchmarks peers—showing the positive trade‑offs of more debt. However, discussion of the countervailing costs of higher leverage (financial distress, higher default risk, impact on credit ratings) is minimal, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding a PARTIAL."

      "reasoning": "The student communicated objectives, explained the WACC methodology with specific inputs and numeric outputs, demonstrated results using automated calculation, and applied findings to a concrete investment decision—showing clear understanding. Delivery included minor verbal disfluencies but the presentation content, structure, and application meet the moderate standard for an effective video presentation."
