  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed key WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market weights) and produced a WACC with numeric justification, then critically reflected on leverage effects, tax benefits, HAMADA implications, project‑specific adjustments, and strategic financing recommendations. This depth of calculation plus reflective analysis meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs, reports a calculated cost of equity (11.65%) and demonstrates application (change to 11.66% with leverage), plus discusses levered beta and project‑specific beta adjustments. This combination of numeric result, input specification, and reflective application meets the thorough conceptual and applied requirements for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated a numeric after‑tax cost of debt (4.58%), correctly explained interest tax deductibility and the resulting tax‑shield effect on WACC, and reflected on limits (rising debt costs, distress). These computations, explanations, and reflections satisfy a thorough treatment for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission supplies correct components and numeric results and reflects on them, but it lacks strict technical evidence required here: no explicit formulas or step‑by‑step calculations, no code/run verification, and no documented block‑by‑block methodology or flowchart. That demonstrates partial technical implementation but not the explicit, verifiable execution required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs and reports specific cost-of-equity values, demonstrating conceptual and numeric application (partial technical implementation). However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit formulas, step‑by‑step calculations, code/run verification, or block-by-block explanation of the CAPM implementation required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports specific market-value weights and debt/total values and shows how weights shift after a $3B issuance, demonstrating correct direction and numeric outputs. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit calculations, formulas, or step‑by‑step determination (e.g., how equity market value was computed from shares × price or how totals were summed/verified), nor any code/run verification or flowchart—so the work is partially but not fully documented for a PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, logical trade‑off: debt lowers effective financing cost via the tax shield but raises financial risk and cost of equity, with quantified examples and a scenario (+$3B) showing the WACC effect. They discuss practical constraints (issuance costs, distress) and recommend a balanced financing approach, demonstrating thorough, well‑organized reasoning."
