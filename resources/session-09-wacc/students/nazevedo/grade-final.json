  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and thoroughly explained WACC components (risk-free rate, market premium, beta/CAPM cost of equity, cost of debt, tax shield, market value weights), applied them in code, produced numeric results and peer comparison, and discussed implications for a $5B project and capital structure. These elements demonstrate a strong, comprehensive grasp meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained CAPM inputs and formula, implemented the calculation in code, and performed sensitivity analysis on beta, demonstrating both conceptual understanding and practical application. These elements constitute a thorough treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined after-tax cost of debt, explicitly stated the 1–t tax shield adjustment, provided numeric inputs (5.8% debt, 21% tax), implemented the calculation in code, and demonstrated its impact via a debt-issuance scenario—constituting a thorough, applied treatment that meets PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented and produced a numeric WACC and demonstrated the pipeline (inputs → weights → cost components → WACC) and scenario testing, showing partial technical execution. However, they did not provide the required strict, explicit block-by-block code explanation, verification steps, or detailed ownership language (e.g., line-by-line function descriptions and explicit test/validation procedures), so the submission falls short of a full PASS under the STRICT technical standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described CAPM, provided inputs (beta=1.3) and ran code producing outputs and sensitivity tests, showing practical application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanations, explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership language, or line/function-level validation, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly planned and executed weight calculation and used market-cap-related inputs (references to Netflix market cap and resulting 6% debt weight), showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT standard they did not provide explicit, block-by-block explanation of how market values were determined (e.g., source/format of market cap vs. debt, treatment of short-term debt, enterprise value adjustments) nor an explicit verification/ownership statement, so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
