You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and applies the WACC formula, explains cost of equity via CAPM, models after-tax cost of debt and tax shield, computes numeric WACC outcomes, and validates economic implications (leverage effects, sensitivity). This is a thorough, correct, and applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly selects and implements CAPM, states the correct formula (risk-free rate + beta × market premium), applies it in code, and adjusts cost of equity for country risk—then validates the results. This is a correct, applied, and sufficiently thorough treatment of the cost-of-equity criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and implements the after-tax cost of debt formula, explicitly multiplies bond yield by (1 − tax rate), and demonstrates the tax-shield effect with numeric WACC outcomes and validation. This is a correct, applied, and sufficiently thorough treatment of the cost-of-debt criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compared WACC results to peer companies and an industry range and used those comparisons to validate economic reasonableness. However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., datasets, websites, or calculators), so validation is present but not documented to the level required for a full PASS.",
