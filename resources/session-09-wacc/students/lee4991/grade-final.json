  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and produced numerical examples, scenario analysis, and peer comparisons. They also reflected on limitations (beta re-leveraging) and ran sensitivity checks, showing thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the CAPM formula with specified inputs and a numeric result (11.65%), integrated it into scenario and sensitivity analyses, and reflected on limitations (need to unlever/re-lever beta). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% * (1–0.21) = 4.582%), applied it in the WACC weighting, and explicitly linked increased debt to tax-shield benefits and lower WACC while acknowledging practical caveats. This demonstrates thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed all WACC components and reported numeric results and scenario checks, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block‑by‑block execution or detailed code walkthrough/verification and did not present an explicit methodology flowchart—so the work is correct but not documented to the level required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs and produced a numeric cost-of-equity used in analysis, showing functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block‑by‑block code execution or a detailed code walkthrough and verification, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values and produced numeric E/V and D/V weights applied in WACC, demonstrating partial technical implementation. Under the STRICT requirement, they did not provide explicit code execution verification or a detailed code/process walkthrough, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presented both sides of the capital‑structure trade‑off: quantified the tax‑shield benefit (lower WACC under added debt) and explicitly acknowledged the countervailing costs (higher beta/borrowing costs and risk). They applied a numeric scenario, compared peers, and gave concrete financing recommendations, demonstrating a logical, balanced treatment of trade‑offs."
