  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC components (cost of equity via CAPM, weighted equity/debt, and debt tax shield), calculates current and new WACC with numeric results, and interprets implications for investment and capital structure. Evidence from Implement and Reflect stages shows both computational use and economic interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines WACC as the project hurdle, calculates numeric WACC values, applies them to project decisions (US projects use firm WACC; international projects use WACC + risk premium), and draws investment recommendations based on those thresholds. This combination of calculation, application to examples, and interpretation meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly built an automated implementation (Colab notebook), represented model components in code, executed the calculations and reported numeric outputs used in analysis and recommendation. This demonstrates practical automation of WACC calculations sufficient for a PASS under the moderate integration standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, reports an explicit numeric cost of equity, and integrates it into the WACC computation, showing correct conceptual use. However the treatment is brief—inputs and assumptions are noted but not justified or examined in depth—so the work is correct but basic, meeting PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax cost of debt formula, explains the tax‑deductibility rationale, and shows numeric impact on WACC. However the treatment is basic—it doesn't explore limits or changing RD with higher leverage, present‑value of the tax shield, or sensitivity—so the explanation is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains and applies the tax shield (RD × (1 − t)) and connects it to a lower WACC and a recommendation, demonstrating correct conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief and omits deeper analysis (e.g., PV of tax shield, limits from financial distress or changing RD with leverage), so it is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student logically presents the benefits of additional debt (tax shield, lower WACC) and compares Netflix's cost position to a peer, showing an understanding of trade‑offs. However, the discussion omits key countervailing costs (default/financial‑distress risk, potential rise in Rd or credit downgrades, covenant constraints) and lacks deeper quantitative trade‑off analysis, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently comprehensive for a full PASS."

      "reasoning": "The video is organized and demonstrates correct procedural understanding (clear intro, method, results, recommendation), but delivery is informal with hesitations and the discussion lacks deeper nuance (sensitivity, caveats, or richer examples) that would satisfy a fully thorough presentation. Thus it shows competent understanding and structure but not the depth required for a full PASS."
