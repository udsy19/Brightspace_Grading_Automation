  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of WACC components and their interaction: explicit CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights, Hamada adjustments, project-specific betas, and sensitivity analysis with numeric results. The DRIVER stages show a structured implementation and validation, meeting the PASS standard for depth and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed cost of equity with CAPM, reported inputs and a numeric result, applied beta adjustments for project-level analysis, and validated the output against market expectations. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a numeric after-tax cost of debt (4.58%) from stated inputs, implemented it in reusable code, and explicitly linked additional debt to a lower WACC via the tax shield. They also validated the result against market credit assumptions and used sensitivity analysis, showing a thorough applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly implemented and ran a sensitivity analysis on capital structure (debt ratio), provided numeric results and a visualization, and validated the behavior. However, the analysis focuses only on leverage; there is no explicit sensitivity testing (or documented runs) for other key inputs like beta, market premium, or cost-of-debt, nor a detailed block-by-block walkthrough of the sensitivity code—so it meets PARTIAL under the strict implementation standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly applies WACC as a hurdle rate for capital-budgeting (project evaluation) and implements project-specific WACCs with actionable recommendations. However, they do not explicitly discuss WACC's role in valuation (e.g., DCF discounting or firm valuation) beyond peer benchmarking, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly stated the analysis objective and key question (hurdle rate).  \nRepresent/Implement — described organized notebook structure, inputs, helper functions, and that code was run to produce results.  \nReflect/Validate — presented numeric outputs, interpreted them relative to peers, and gave strategic recommendations.",

The transcript shows organized flow, concrete numbers, and interpreted conclusions sufficient for a passing evaluation."
