  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a clear, detailed understanding of the WACC formula and its components, implements the calculation with numeric examples, and interprets implications for financing decisions. The combination of definition (Discover), coded application (Implement), and interpretation/recommendation (Reflect) meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM to obtain a cost of equity, implemented the calculation in code, produced numeric cost-of-equity results (11.65%) and discussed beta (1.3) and implications. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied the after-tax cost-of-debt formula (multiplying by 1−tax rate), explained the tax-shield mechanism qualitatively, computed numeric pre- and post-tax rates, and used these in WACC scenarios. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric calculation, and applied interpretation meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implements and reports WACC components and scenario outputs, demonstrating applied understanding. However, per the strict technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution details (e.g., \"I ran this script\"), block‑by‑block code explanation, or explicit ownership/defense of the code, so the implementation is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually, implemented code, and reported numeric cost-of-equity results, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this script\"), provide block‑by‑block code explanations, or explicitly claim ownership/verification of outputs, so the evidence falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies market‑value weights, implements code, and reports numeric weight results, demonstrating understanding and partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this script\"), provide block‑by‑block code explanation, or clearly assert ownership/verification of outputs, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "Represent — student laid out a stepwise framework mapping costs, weights, scenarios and peer comparisons to analyze trade‑offs. Implement — they computed scenario WACCs (e.g., 11.22% → 11.13% with added debt) to quantify effects. Reflect — they interpreted numeric results, recommended more debt to lower WACC, and explicitly discussed risks (beta, potential higher cost of debt) and project‑level implications.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents quantitative examples, a clear methodological plan, and balanced interpretation: showing debt is cheaper, demonstrating limited WACC reduction from modest debt increases, and acknowledging the risk/constraint (beta and rising cost of debt). This coherent, evidence‑based discussion of benefits and risks constitutes a thorough, logical presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs."

Reflect/Validate: student interpreted numeric WACC outputs, compared to industry targets and peers, and provided financing recommendations.",
      "reasoning": "The video communicates a clear purpose, explains the WACC methodology, shows implemented calculations, reports quantitative results, and interprets implications for financing—demonstrating effective presentation and understanding. Minor verbal disfluencies do not undermine the logical flow or substance, so the presentation merits a PASS."
