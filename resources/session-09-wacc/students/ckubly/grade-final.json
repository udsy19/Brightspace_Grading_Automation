  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and numerically applies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights), provides code-based calculation, and demonstrates an applied example (issuance of $3bn reducing WACC) plus interpretation of tax-shield and peer comparisons — meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies an after‑tax cost of debt and demonstrates the tax‑shield effect with a quantitative example that lowers WACC, plus qualitative peer comparisons. While the submission omits an explicit tax‑rate breakdown, the conceptual explanation plus applied example meet the moderate-standard threshold for a thorough, practical treatment of the tax‑shield effect.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses firmwide WACC as a baseline hurdle for a $5bn investment, implements the calculation in code, and thoughtfully discusses when to adjust the hurdle (project‑specific versus firmwide) with concrete examples (US vs international). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of using WACC for investment decision‑making, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies CAPM to produce a plausible cost-of-equity figure and links it to beta and WACC (showing understanding). However, they do not document CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, market premium) or show the calculation steps or sensitivity, so the treatment is correct but incomplete — meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an after‑tax cost of debt and applies it in a concrete example showing the tax‑deductible debt lowers WACC, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the pre‑tax interest rate, corporate tax rate, or the explicit calculation steps for the after‑tax conversion, so the treatment is accurate but incomplete — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct component values and a plausible WACC and indicates code was used and a personal calculation was made, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, they did not explicitly show block‑by‑block understanding, detailed ownership of the code, or verification steps required by the strict rubric, so the result is PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains the benefit of debt (tax shield), provides a concrete numeric example and peer comparison, and recommends a capital‑structure change — showing solid understanding of one side of the trade‑off. However, they do not meaningfully discuss the opposing costs of higher leverage (financial distress, increased equity risk/cost, agency issues) or non‑linear trade‑offs, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL."
