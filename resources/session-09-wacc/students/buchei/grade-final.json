  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the cost‑of‑capital problem, provided concrete inputs and scope, and connected the WACC result to a specific Netflix financing recommendation, demonstrating explicit and actionable Discover/Define thinking. This satisfies the strict requirement for an explicit, defendable problem definition and decision context.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly uses WACC as the baseline hurdle rate for a $5B capital project, adjusts the hurdle for higher project risk, and links capital‑structure changes to firm‑value implications. This demonstrates clear recognition of WACC applications in both capital budgeting and valuation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides a concrete financing recommendation (target debt ratio) and explains the economic rationale (tax shield lowers WACC and raises firm value), tying analysis to strategy. This explicit, actionable insight satisfies the Reflect criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies key WACC components (weights, after‑tax cost of debt, cost of equity via their code) and computes a numeric WACC and strategic implication, showing functional understanding. However the treatment is not thorough: cost of equity calculation and explicit formulas/derivations are not shown, numeric reporting is inconsistent, and deeper justification (e.g., sensitivity or explicit CAPM math) is missing — so the work is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs (beta, risk-free, market premium) and reports running a calculation, showing conceptual and implementation understanding. However the submission omits the explicit CAPM formula, the numeric cost-of-equity result, and supporting derivation or justification, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the tax shield concept and applies the after‑tax debt formula to get a numeric result and links it to capital structure strategy, showing conceptual and implementation understanding. However the presentation contains a numeric/notation inconsistency and lacks detailed derivation, sensitivity analysis, or explicit stepwise calculation, so the treatment is correct but not fully thorough.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly states the objective and key inputs; Implement — describes the execution approach (parameters, code, cost calculations); Validate/Evolve — reports numeric result and connects it to a financing recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The presenter communicates a clear objective, lists inputs, explains the method used, reports results, and ties findings to a business recommendation, demonstrating understanding. Delivery has some disfluency and lacks deep derivations, but overall the video effectively conveys the WACC analysis and its implications."
