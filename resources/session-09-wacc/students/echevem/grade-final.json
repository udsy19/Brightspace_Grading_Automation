  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear, applied, and specific treatment of the WACC formula and its components: provided input data, stated the CAPM equation for equity, described after-tax debt treatment, and detailed the weighting and decision rule. This substantive, stepwise application to a firm-level example demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies CAPM, provides numeric inputs (r_f, beta, r_m), states the formula, and integrates it into the stepwise implementation for computing WACC. This specific, applied treatment with explanation of the economic intuition demonstrates a thorough and correct understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student provides a clear, applied description of automation (stepwise logic, scripted execution, printed steps and decision) and explicitly states the approach is reusable, demonstrating integration of finance and technology beyond a single example. This substantive, generalizable treatment satisfies the PASS standard for a moderate evaluation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies needed inputs and explicitly states the after‑tax adjustment and tax deductibility, integrating it into the implementation steps. However, the treatment is brief and lacks a concrete numeric after‑tax calculation or discussion of the tax‑shield magnitude/implications, so it demonstrates correct but incomplete understanding consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies the tax rate, pre‑tax debt cost, and explicitly states that interest is tax‑deductible and will be adjusted (after‑tax cost), integrating it into the calculation steps. However, treatment is brief and lacks a numeric after‑tax calculation or deeper discussion of the tax‑shield magnitude/implications, so it demonstrates correct but incomplete understanding consistent with PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly and clearly uses WACC as the hurdle rate and integrates it into a reproducible decision process (explicit comparison and automation), showing solid conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: the submission states the decision rule but lacks deeper discussion of limitations, project-specific risk adjustments, or demonstration of an actual computed WACC value, so it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

        "\"Hi, this is Mauricio. In this session, I'm working through a classic corporate-finance problem: calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and using it to decide whether a project is worth pursuing.\"",
        "\"Step 1: Market values. Equity market value is 80M times $25, and Debt market value is $500M times 0.97. ... Step 3: Cost of equity. This is calculated using CAPM ... Step 4: After-tax cost of debt. ... Step 5: WACC. ... Step 6: Compare with project return.\"",
        "\"By walking through these steps, I not only get the final decision but also understand: How equity and debt contribute differently to financing, how taxes affect borrowing costs, why CAPM matters in real corporate decisions, and how companies evaluate whether to invest millions into a project.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly frames the question and objective; Represent — organizes inputs and breaks the problem into components; Implement/Validate — presents a clear stepwise computational workflow (market values → weights → CAPM → after‑tax debt → WACC → decision); Reflect — summarizes insights and generalizability of the method.",
      "reasoning": "The student delivers a coherent, well-structured spoken walkthrough with concrete inputs, explicit stepwise methodology, and reflective interpretation—demonstrating clear communication and understanding suitable for a strong video presentation."
