  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its components: clear conceptual definitions, explicit calculation steps and numeric results, scenario analysis (debt issuance) and peer/project-specific adjustments. Minor wording inconsistency in describing the direction of WACC change does not undermine the overall correct and detailed treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines after-tax cost of debt, provides numeric inputs (pre-tax debt 5.8%, tax rate 21%), and demonstrates application by computing after-tax debt in the WACC model and discussing the tax-shield impact and comparative effects on WACC. Treatment is specific, applied, and supports a thorough understanding (minor wording inconsistency does not undermine competence).\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defines the tax-shield effect, supplies numeric inputs (pre-tax debt, tax rate) and implements after-tax cost-of-debt in WACC calculations, then applies this to a leverage scenario and peer comparison to show its impact. This applied, specific discussion and calculation constitute a thorough treatment appropriate for PASS (minor wording inconsistencies do not undermine the demonstrated understanding).\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly names CAPM as the method for cost-of-equity and provides a specific cost-of-equity value, showing conceptual understanding and application in WACC. However, they do not show the CAPM inputs or the calculation (risk-free rate, beta, market premium) or justify the chosen beta/premia, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used AI code, described what the code does, and reported numeric outputs, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirements they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, stepwise/block-level understanding, or independent verification/ownership of the code, so the work falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student names CAPM and provides a cost-of-equity number, but fails the STRICT technical requirements: there is no explicit CAPM calculation shown (no beta, risk-free rate, market premium), no block-by-block code explanation, and no statement of personal execution or verification. Under the rubric, this omission mandates a FAIL.",

      "driver_alignment": "DISCOVER — student defined tax-shield and hurdle-rate concepts; REPRESENT/IMPLEMENT — compared numeric capital-structure outcomes (Netflix vs Disney) and showed how weights affect WACC; EVOLVE — recommended strategic leverage changes to lower WACC.",
      "reasoning": "The student logically presents benefits of debt (tax shield, lower after‑tax cost) and uses a peer comparison and scenario to argue Netflix is underlevered, showing a coherent pro-debt case. However, they do not explicitly address the countervailing trade-offs (financial distress, covenant/credit risk, agency costs, or optimal leverage limits), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

        "[\"So here are all the numbers and then um here are the results. So the market value of equity is $200 billion. The market value of debt is $13 billion. The cost of equity is 11.6 65% ... And then the total calculated WACC is 11.22%.\"]"

      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, organized explanation of WACC, shows the methodology (automation + inputs), provides concrete numeric results, and applies those results to scenarios and strategy — satisfying effective presentation standards. The combination of definition, method, numbers, and applied interpretation demonstrates strong understanding and communication."
