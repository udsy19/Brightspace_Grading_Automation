  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains WACC components (market vs book values, weights, cost of equity via CAPM, cost of debt, tax rate), computes WACC quantitatively, and applies sensitivity (additional debt) and comparative examples (Disney, project vs firm rate). Coverage is detailed, applied, and shows strong conceptual mastery, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified CAPM inputs, computed Re = Rf + beta·MRP yielding 11.65%, and applied that result in analysis and comparisons, showing both procedural and conceptual understanding. Coverage includes numeric calculation, interpretation of beta, and application to WACC and peer benchmarking, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified cost of debt (5.8%) and corporate tax rate (21%), discussed the tax‑shield concept, and applied these in the WACC calculation (yielding 11.22%) and a sensitivity (additional $3B debt lowering WACC). This demonstrates both procedural use of after‑tax debt and conceptual understanding, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates numeric WACC calculation and rerun validation, showing they executed the computation and checked a sensitivity. However, the submission lacks strict technical detail required here: no block‑by‑block code explanation, no explicit demonstration of personal implementation steps or ownership of the code, and limited methodological detail. That meets PARTIAL under the strict technical standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs and reports a numeric Re, but under the STRICT technical standard they fail to show personal execution, block‑by‑block code explanation, or explicit ownership/verification of implementation. Lacking those explicit technical details warrants FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly explained why to use market values, provided the market-value inputs (E and D), and computed the resulting weights—demonstrating correct conceptual and numeric treatment. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit implementation details (e.g., how market values were derived from data, code or step‑by‑step verification), so the evidence supports a partial rather than full technical pass.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Framed Netflix financing decision and identified capital‑structure inputs.\n- Represent/Implement: Calculated baseline and ran a $3B debt‑issuance sensitivity to quantify impact on WACC.\n- Reflect/Evolve: Interpreted tax‑shield benefit, compared to peers (Disney), recommended paced leverage increases and cautioned about over‑leveraging.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the trade‑offs: quantifies how adding debt lowers WACC, explains the tax‑shield benefit, compares to peer capital structures, and balances the benefit with a cautionary note on excessive leverage—using a concrete sensitivity and peer example. This is a logical, well‑supported presentation meeting PASS criteria."

Delivery has informal speech and minor disfluencies but successfully communicates understanding and actionable insights, meeting the criterion for an effective presentation."
