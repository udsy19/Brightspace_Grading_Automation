  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC: they state the formula, compute weights and component rates with numeric examples, implement a calculation tool, and critically address complexities (lease capitalization, market vs book values, and levering/unlevering beta). These elements show depth beyond a basic description, warranting a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a numeric cost of equity, uses beta as an input, implements a calculation tool, and explicitly applies advanced CAPM-related adjustment (unlever/relever beta) when capital structure changes. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM for cost-of-equity estimation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the after-tax treatment of debt (multiplying pre-tax cost by 1–tax rate), implements a tool to compute cost-of-debt as a component of WACC, and discusses the tax-shield benefit and related risks. This applied explanation plus implementation and reflection shows a thorough understanding of after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield concept.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states the WACC formula, supplies inputs and numeric WACC outputs, and describes implementing a script and validating results. However, they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (no \"I ran the code\" or run outputs, no block-by-block explanation of functions), nor full ownership of implementation (relied on Gemini for validation). Under the STRICT technical standard this is therefore a partial demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates correct CAPM concepts (uses beta, reports a numeric cost of equity, and applies unlever/relever adjustments) and describes implementing a script. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not explicitly show personal execution (no \"I ran the code\" outputs), block-by-block code explanation, or full ownership of implementation (relied on Gemini for validation). This warrants a partial score.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and uses market values, provides numeric equity/debt market values and computed weights, and describes implementing a script to calculate them. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show explicit personal execution (no run outputs, no block-by-block code explanation, and relied on Gemini for validation), so the demonstration is incomplete and rates as PARTIAL.",

They implemented a systematic analysis and reflected on strategic implications, demonstrating a logical, well-supported presentation of capital-structure trade-offs."
