You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC components (CAPM for equity, after‑tax debt cost, and market‑value weights), implements them in a model, and produces numeric WACC results and scenario/sensitivity analysis. Coverage is detailed, correct, and applied to decision-making, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains CAPM, justifies input choices (risk‑free rate, beta, market premium), implements the formula in code, and reports the computed cost of equity (11.65%) applied to WACC and project valuation. This is a thorough, correct application meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax‑shield rationale, implements after‑tax cost = yield*(1−tax rate) in code, and reports the computed after‑tax debt cost applied to WACC. This is a complete, numerically supported treatment meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performs external benchmarking by comparing Netflix's WACC to Disney's and discusses structural reasons (debt mix), which shows validation effort. However, they do not cite sources or tools for the Disney WACC or other external checks, so validation is present but not fully documented—hence PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "DISCOVER framed the trade‑off question (how to pay for the investment). REPRESENT decomposed costs (equity vs debt, tax shield). IMPLEMENT and EVOLVE produced quantitative analysis (WACC function, sensitivity sweep) and VALIDATE/REFLECT applied results to recommend increased leverage.",
      "reasoning": "The student logically presents trade‑offs with numerical comparisons (costs of equity vs after‑tax debt), implements and interprets a sensitivity analysis showing WACC falls with more debt, and links this to a concrete financing recommendation while acknowledging risk effects. Coverage is applied, data‑driven, and sufficiently thorough for PASS."
