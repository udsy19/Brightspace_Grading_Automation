  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, conceptually correct treatment of WACC components (formula, CAPM for equity, after-tax debt, market-value weights, tax shield) and applies them with numeric examples and sensitivity analysis. Minor label/inconsistency issues in wording (e.g., mixed notation for weights vs. rates, slight debt-yield mentions) do not undermine the clear, comprehensive understanding and application shown.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies pre‑tax debt yield, applies the tax rate to obtain the after‑tax cost (5.8% → 4.58%), and uses that value in WACC computations and leverage sensitivity analysis, showing both conceptual and applied understanding of the tax shield. Coverage is specific and applied, satisfying a thorough treatment for this moderate criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates both conceptual understanding (includes the (1−TC) tax shield term and explains its role) and applied calculation (uses a 21% tax rate on a 5.8% pre‑tax yield to produce a 4.58% after‑tax cost and uses it in WACC and recommendations). Coverage is specific, numeric, and integrated into analysis, satisfying a thorough treatment for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and supplies CAPM inputs (rf, MRP, beta) and attempts to compute cost of equity within the WACC implementation, showing procedural understanding. However, they do not explicitly show the CAPM calculation or report the resulting cost-of-equity value, and there is a labeling/numbering inconsistency (e.g., \"WE is 6.1%\" appears incorrect given the stated capital values). These gaps and small errors mean the treatment is correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports the formula and final WACC values and says they ran code, but provides no block‑by‑block explanation of the implementation, no explicit CAPM/cost‑of‑equity calculation shown, and contains ambiguous/inconsistent intermediate values (e.g., \"WE is 6.1%\"). Under the STRICT technical implementation standard requiring explicit personal execution and detailed code understanding, the evidence is insufficient, so the criterion fails.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student names CAPM inputs and claims to have run code, they do not show the CAPM formula application, the explicit cost‑of‑equity calculation, nor any block‑by‑block code explanation or personal verification required by the STRICT technical standard. Because explicit implementation details, code walkthrough, and ownership are missing, the submission fails this criterion.",

      "reasoning": "The student provides a clear, structured explanation of the WACC methodology—defining the formula, explaining components including the tax shield and market‑value weights, and supplying numerical inputs for CAPM and debt—then applies these to produce and validate WACC outputs. While the explicit intermediate RE calculation isn't voiced step‑by‑step, the combination of defined method, inputs, and resulting numbers demonstrates a thorough, communicable methodology appropriate for this criterion."

      "reasoning": "The student clearly identifies the key tradeoffs (tax shield and lower WACC vs. higher leverage risk and credit cost), quantifies effects via sensitivity analysis, and provides concrete, numerically justified recommendations (10–15% target debt, avoid >20–30% without stronger cash flows). This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric examples, and actionable guidance meets the standard for a thorough, logical presentation."
