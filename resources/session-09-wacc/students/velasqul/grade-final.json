  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains WACC components (weights, CAPM for RE, cost of debt, 1–T tax shield), uses market vs book values, applies numbers to compute WACC and a leverage scenario, and validates results with code — demonstrating comprehensive, applied understanding (Implement + Reflect). Minor verbal/slip errors do not undermine the thorough conceptual treatment, so this meets PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, identifies its components (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium), applies it with explicit numeric inputs, and confirms the computed cost of equity (11.65%) using code. This combination of conceptual explanation, a concrete calculation, and programmatic validation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies cost of debt as the bond yield, explains and applies the (1–T) tax shield, computes the after-tax debt contribution in the WACC example, and validates results with code. This combination of conceptual explanation, numerical application, and validation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and applies CAPM and reports a validated numeric result (11.65%), showing functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (detailed \"I ran this and verified\" language) nor provide block-by-block explanation of the code, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly distinguishes market vs book values and uses market-value inputs to compute capital-structure weights, demonstrating technical understanding. However, under the STRICT implementation standard they did not provide an explicit execution statement or a block-by-block code walkthrough/ownership of the script, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student runs a concrete sensitivity scenario (adding $3B debt) and reports its effect on WACC, showing applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit execution statements, block-by-block code explanation, or a broader range of input variations — so the sensitivity work is correct but limited, yielding PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student correctly identifies the core trade-off (debt lowers WACC but raises risk), demonstrates it with a specific $3B scenario, and reflects on downsides—showing clear conceptual understanding. However the treatment is brief and lacks deeper quantitative exploration (e.g., multiple scenarios, bankruptcy costs, impact on beta/credit spreads), so it meets PARTIAL rather than a thorough PASS."
