  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission presents the WACC formula, explains each component (Re via CAPM, Rd with tax shield, E/V and D/V weights), and shows numerical application to Netflix (calculated Re, market values, WACC ~11.22% and the effect of new debt). Reflection on project-specific WACC and comparison/sensitivity analysis demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, uses provided inputs to compute Re = 11.65%, and runs the calculation in Colab, demonstrating applied proficiency (Implement). They further interpret the result's significance for shareholder returns and WACC (Reflect), providing a thorough, well-supported treatment that meets PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines after-tax cost of debt in the WACC context and explicitly links debt financing to the tax shield. They apply this concept quantitatively (showing WACC falling from 11.22% to 11.13% after new debt) and reflect on broader implications (sensitivity analysis and underutilized tax shield), demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states the WACC formula and computes key components (Re, equity/debt weights) and a numeric WACC, showing partial technical correctness. However, they did not explicitly report numeric Rd or tax rate, nor show explicit, personal execution/stepwise code explanation or verification (only a Colab reference), so the strict technical-implementation requirements are not fully met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM with clear inputs and a numeric Re, indicating functional implementation, but fails to explicitly demonstrate personal code runs, stepwise/code-block explanations, or explicit verification/ownership of the Colab work; therefore the strict technical requirements are only partially met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student presents explicit market-value numbers and correctly computes weights, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the strict requirement they did not demonstrate data sourcing (market vs. book debt), document the method used to determine those market values, or provide explicit personal code execution/block-level verification, so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
