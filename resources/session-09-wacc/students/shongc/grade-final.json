They also demonstrate conceptual depth by acknowledging and proposing correction for leverage-induced beta changes, satisfying thorough understanding required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly derives and numerically applies the after-tax cost of debt, uses it in scenario analysis to demonstrate the tax-shield lowering WACC, and shows deeper understanding by acknowledging offsetting effects (higher default risk, relevering).
