  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the cost‑of‑capital problem and the Netflix financing decision, listing objectives and the specific inputs needed to compute WACC. This explicit framing and identification of parameters demonstrates a sound Discover/Define stage.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly mapped capital‑structure elements to the WACC framework by stating the formula (E/V, D/V), providing the market‑value inputs (market cap, debt, V), and reporting computed component rates (cost of equity, after‑tax debt). This explicit correspondence of inputs to WACC components satisfies the Represent requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly uses WACC as an investment hurdle and recommends project‑specific discount rates (including a higher rate for international content), demonstrating clear recognition of WACC’s role in capital budgeting and valuation. This explicit application satisfies the Evolve criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines WACC, computes key components (cost of equity and after‑tax debt), and compares firm and project rates versus peers, showing conceptual understanding. However, inconsistent numeric WACC outputs and reliance on external code with limited explanation reduce thoroughness and clarity, so the work meets a basic but incomplete treatment of the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs and supplies a plausible cost-of-equity figure, showing conceptual understanding and application. However, the work lacks a clear, thorough derivation (and shows inconsistent WACC-related numbers) and relies on external code assistance, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and reports the after‑tax cost of debt and notes the tax‑shield tradeoff, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is not thorough (limited explanation of the tax‑shield magnitude, inconsistent WACC figures, and reliance on external code), so the evidence supports a partial rather than full pass.",
