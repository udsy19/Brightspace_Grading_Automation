  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied WACC components (risk-free rate, MRP, CAPM for cost of equity, tax-adjusted cost of debt, and market-value weights) and demonstrated leverage adjustment via Hamada, producing consistent numeric results and sensitivity checks. The treatment is detailed, uses specific values and calculations, and includes validation steps, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly specified CAPM inputs, applied the formula with accurate arithmetic (4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%), implemented it in code, and integrated leverage adjustments via Hamada, demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding of cost of equity. These elements across Discover, Represent, and Implement meet the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed pre-tax and after-tax cost of debt with a clear numeric calculation (5.8% → 4.58% after 21% tax), implemented it in code, and tested robustness across tax-rate scenarios, demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding of the tax shield and its impact on WACC.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: While the numerical WACC components and result are stated and reasonable, the STRICT technical-implementation standard requires explicit evidence of personal code execution, block-level explanation, and ownership. The submission only reports AI-assisted translation and final numbers without showing code, execution/verification steps, or detailed implementation ownership, so it fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states CAPM inputs and the resulting 11.65% cost of equity, demonstrating conceptual correctness (Represent and Validate). However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard the submission lacks explicit evidence of personal code execution, block-by-block explanation, or verification of results (only an AI-assisted translation is claimed), so it fails the requirement for demonstrated implementation ownership.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states market vs book debt and reports market-value weights, but under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit evidence of personal execution, code, or step-by-step determination of equity and debt market values (no calculation steps or verification). Lacking block-level implementation and ownership means the requirement for explicit demonstration of market-value weight determination is not met.",
