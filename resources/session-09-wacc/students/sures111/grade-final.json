  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula, identifies cost of equity via CAPM and after‑tax cost of debt, implements the calculation and runs sensitivity scenarios, and reflects on leverage implications—a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS standards. Minor verbal slips do not undermine the demonstrated conceptual mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM as the method for cost of equity, explains its role (opportunity cost), implements it in calculation, and runs sensitivity tests on beta and market premium—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding. Minor verbal slips in phrasing do not undermine the clear conceptual and practical mastery shown.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the after‑tax cost of debt formula, implements it in their calculation, and uses the result to draw finance-relevant conclusions about leverage and the tax shield. This demonstrates accurate conceptual understanding and applied use, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states the WACC formula, describes implementing it in code, and reports a numeric WACC—showing substantive technical work. However, they do not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanation, a clear statement of having run and verified the code, or detailed validation steps required by the STRICT rubric, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student mentions using CAPM and code and shows sensitivity results, but provides no explicit code, no block‑by‑block explanation, no statement that they ran and verified the implementation, and even misstates the CAPM expression—failing the STRICT requirement for explicit technical demonstration and ownership.\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes computing proportions but never explicitly states how equity and debt market values were determined (market cap vs. book value, treatment of outstanding debt, or data sources), nor provides code, block‑by‑block explanation, or a run/verification statement required by the STRICT rubric. Missing these explicit details fails the criterion.",
