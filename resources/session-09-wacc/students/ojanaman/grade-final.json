  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed WACC values, showed component calculations (cost of equity via beta/CAPM, after‑tax debt, leverage effects and beta adjustments), and applied them to multiple scenarios with interpretation of impacts and tax shields. Coverage is specific, applied, and connects formulas to strategic conclusions, meeting the threshold for a thorough demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market premium), implemented a cost-of-equity function and lever/unlever adjustments, and reported cost-of-equity results for multiple scenarios (firm and project-specific betas). This shows a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM and its role in computing equity cost, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identified appropriate inputs (pre‑tax debt yield and corporate tax rate), implemented functions to calculate after‑tax cost of debt and WACC, and produced explicit tax‑shield estimates (e.g., $158M, larger shields under higher leverage). They also interpreted the practical impact (minimal WACC change given low leverage), demonstrating applied and comprehensive treatment of after‑tax cost of debt and tax‑shield benefits.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented WACC calculations, wrote functions, ran scenario analyses and reported numeric results, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit \"I ran and verified\" testing details, or in‑depth walkthrough of each function required by the STRICT technical standard for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student applied CAPM inputs and produced cost‑of‑equity results, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanations, first‑person verification (\"I ran and tested...\"), or detailed walkthrough of the CAPM function implementation, so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market‑value inputs (market cap and market debt), computed total capital and reported explicit market‑value weights (93.9% equity, 6.1% debt), showing correct methodology. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough, explicit testing/verification statements, or detailed ownership of implementation, so the work merits partial rather than full credit.",

      "reasoning": "The student presented multiple financing scenarios, quantified impacts (WACC changes, tax shields, savings), and explained the trade‑offs between lower cost via leverage and increased financial risk (beta). They applied these results to recommend a pragmatic financing path and discussed limitations (minimal effect given high equity), demonstrating a logical, well‑supported presentation of capital structure trade‑offs."

      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, structured narrative (problem definition, planned calculations, scenario outputs) and communicates numeric results and managerial implications. Explanations of methodology, examples (scenarios) and a concise recommendation demonstrate effective presentation and understanding, meeting the PASS standard."
