You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and computes WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), provides numeric results and a simulation with additional debt, and interprets the economic implications (tax shield and optimal leverage). Coverage is specific, applied to a real example, and demonstrates a strong conceptual and practical grasp.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly treats WACC as the investment hurdle (numeric WACC provided), applies it to a concrete $5B content decision, and discusses adjusting the hurdle by project risk and capital structure—demonstrating applied, comprehensive understanding suitable for PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated WACC calculation in Python, supplied inputs, ran and printed results across scenarios, and used those outputs to inform recommendations—demonstrating applied automation of WACC calculations consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements CAPM inputs and signals computation of cost of equity, but they do not explicitly show the CAPM formula application, the resulting numeric cost-of-equity, or discussion of assumptions—so understanding is correct but treatment is basic/incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies inputs and states they computed the after-tax cost of debt and incorporated the tax shield, and they implemented this in code. However, they do not show the explicit after-tax cost calculation or a numeric value/explanation of the tax-shield mechanics, so the treatment is accurate but basic/incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes and implements the tax shield by using after-tax cost of debt and shows its economic effect (WACC reduction and value enhancement). However, they do not show the explicit after-tax calculation or quantify the tax-shield mechanics in detail, so the treatment is accurate but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",
