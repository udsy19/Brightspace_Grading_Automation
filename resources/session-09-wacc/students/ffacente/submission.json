  "transcript": "All right. Hello. This is an analysis of Netflix's weighted average cost of capital or WACC calculated to evaluate a hypothetical $5 billion content investment. Um, I'm using the driver framework. The goal is to determine the current whack. Assess the impact of a three billion debt insurance and compare these figures against industry peers like Disney and Amazon. So the first stage define and discover. We begin with the define phase. Here I've isolated the financial inputs based on current market conditions and Netflix's specific parameters. Market data we assume a risk-free rate of 4.5%. based on a 10-year Treasury and a market risk premium of 5 a.5%. Netflix's parameters, we're using a market capitalization of $200 billion. For equity, crucially for the debt component, we use the market value of debt, $13 billion, not the book value as cost of capital is a market driven metric. The cost of debt, the pre-tax cost of debt is 5.8% % which reflects their tripleB plus credit rating and beta we using an equity beta of 1.3 indicating Netflix is 30% more volatile than the broader market then we go to the R stage represent I have mapped out the analytical approach using two core functions first calculate cost of equity this implements the capital asset pricing model CAPM m the formula risk-f free rate plus beta times market risk premium this represents the return equity investors require for the risk they are taking and second the calculate wcc whack this function weighs the cost of equity and debt by their respective proportions in their capital structure crucial detail um because Investment payments are taxdeductible. I multiply the cost of debt by one minus the corporate tax rate. This is the tax shield and it's a key driver in why debt is generally cheaper than equity. Next, that leads us to the implement stage. We where we actually execute the calculation in three steps. Step one, we calculate the cost of equity using the CAPM function. Given the high beta of 1.3, we expect this to be significantly higher than the market average. Step two, calculate the current whack. This uses the existing $200 billion in equity in the $13 billion in debt structure. Then step three, we calculate the proform whack. Um Netflix is considering you issuing a $3 billion in additional debt. In this step, I increase the debt variable by three billion while holding equity constant. This allows us to isolate the impact of the new leverage on overall cost of capital. Um, step four, validate. This is where I actually run the script to verify like the solution. And if we look at the output down here, cost of equity calculated to be 11.65% and that makes sense. It is a risk-free rate 4.5% plus the risk premium weighted by beta and the cost of debt after tax is roughly 4 and a.5%. This confirms the tax shield is working reducing the 5.8% yield down to an effect of just about 4.6. In the whack results, current whack comes into roughly at 11 and a half% and the postisssued whack drops slowly to 11.12%. Then that leads us to the E stage evolve. I looked for like a faster route or in this case a more optimal structure. I generated a sensitivity analysis using visualization whack against total debt levels ranging from 0 to 50 billion dollars. Looking at this chart down here, the red line is Netflix's whack. You can see the downward slope. As debt increases, the whack decreases. The visualization proves that Netflix is currently underleveraged. They are funding almost everything with expense equity rather than cheap debt. However, this model assumes the cost of debt stays constant in reality. If they had borrowed $50 billion, their credit rating would drop and the cost of debt would rise, eventually curving this line back up. But for the immediate $3 billion decision, the downward trend is valid. And then for the final stage R, reflect. Comparing Netflix to its peers down here, Disney has a whack of 8.2% while Netflix is around 11.2%. And why the difference? Disney uses 30% debt and Netflix only uses about 6% debt. Disney is optimizing the tax shield better than Netflix. And additionally, Netflix pure play streaming model is riskier than Disney's diversified conglomerate model. And some final recommendations. Um Netflix should proceed with a $3 billion debt insurance. It lowers the cost of capital without significantly jeopardizing their credit rating and project hurdle rates. While the firmwide whack is 11%, international content creation carries higher execution and currency risk. For those specific projects, we would add a risk premium, setting the hurdle rate closer to 13 14% rather than the standard 11. And this concludes my analysis. The capital structure is robust but inefficiently weighted toward equity. Thank you.",
