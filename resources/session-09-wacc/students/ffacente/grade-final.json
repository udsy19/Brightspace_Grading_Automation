  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied the CAPM for cost of equity, used market values and after-tax cost of debt in the WACC weighting, and produced consistent numeric results (11.65% equity, ~11.1–11.5% WACC). They also discussed the tax shield and leverage sensitivity, showing thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and implications.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied CAPM with stated inputs (4.5% risk-free, 5.5% market premium, beta 1.3) and produced the correct arithmetic result (4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%), plus provided interpretation of the higher equity cost due to beta. This is a specific, correctly executed and well-explained treatment that meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified pre-tax cost of debt, explicitly applied the (1 - tax rate) adjustment, produced a numeric after-tax cost (~4.6%), and integrated this into WACC and peer comparisons. This clear, applied treatment of the tax shield and after-tax cost meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student validated outputs internally and compared WACC results to peer companies (Disney/Amazon), showing validation intent and interpretation. However, they did not cite specific external sources, tools, or data providers for those peer figures, so validation is present but not fully externally documented, meriting PARTIAL.",
