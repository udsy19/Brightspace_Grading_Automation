  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market value weights), computed numeric inputs and WACC under current and revised leverage, and provided economic validation and sensitivity analysis. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified CAPM, supplied key inputs (beta, RF, MRP), executed the calculation in code and reported a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), then applied and interpreted it within WACC and sensitivity analysis. This constitutes a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed numeric WACC values, used WACC explicitly as the standard hurdle rate for US content, adjusted it for higher‑risk international projects, and tied WACC movements to financing choices and sensitivity analysis. This applied, project‑specific use of WACC and discussion of implications meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and implemented an after‑tax cost of debt, reported a numeric result (≈4.58%), and applied it in the WACC and sensitivity analysis, demonstrating correct conceptual application. However, they did not show the tax rate or the explicit tax‑shield calculation/quantification or discuss its magnitude, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed and applied an after‑tax cost of debt and showed its effect on WACC, demonstrating conceptual use of the tax advantage. However, they did not state the tax rate or explicitly explain/quantify the interest deductibility mechanism (tax shield) itself, so the treatment is correct but insufficiently detailed for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed the calculation, listed inputs and reported numeric COE, after‑tax COD, and WACC values, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit formulas (e.g., tax rate, WACC equation) or a detailed walkthrough required by the STRICT rubric, so the submission is incomplete for a full PASS.",
