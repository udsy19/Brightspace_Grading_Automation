  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses WACC components (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, yield-based cost of debt with tax shield) and applies them numerically to compute a current WACC and the effect of additional debt. Their use of concrete inputs, computed after-tax cost of debt and resulting WACC, plus interpretation of leverage effects, shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies bond yield and corporate tax rate, computes a numeric after-tax cost of debt (~4.58%), and explicitly links the tax-deductibility of interest to a lower borrowing cost and reduced WACC. They apply these results to scenario analysis (adding debt) and interpret the tax-shield benefit, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies interest deductibility as the tax shield, supplies the corporate tax rate, computes a numeric after-tax cost of debt (~4.58%), and shows how this reduces WACC when adding debt. That applied, numeric treatment and interpretation demonstrate a thorough, correct understanding of the tax-shield effect.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies CAPM conceptually, provides a beta and a computed cost of equity (≈11.65%), and implements it in their calculations (Implement stage). However, they omit explicit CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, market risk premium) and a clear formulaic derivation, so the treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports numeric WACC results, they repeatedly attribute calculation and visuals to Gemini and never state they ran, inspected, or explained the code functions or verification steps. Under the STRICT technical standard (explicit execution, ownership, and block-level explanation), the submission fails to demonstrate required personal implementation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports a CAPM output and credits an AI (Gemini) for the Python implementation but provides no explicit proof they ran, inspected, or explained the code (no risk-free rate or market premium inputs, no formula breakdown, no block-by-block description). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring personal execution and ownership, this fails to meet the criterion.",
