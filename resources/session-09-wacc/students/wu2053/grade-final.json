You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and correctly applies the WACC formula and components (CAPM for Re, after-tax Rd, market-value weights, Hamada relevering) and runs numeric examples and scenarios that demonstrate applied understanding. Their DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT stages show thorough, coherent treatment with calculation, sensitivity, and interpretation—meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and applies the CAPM formula, uses stated inputs (beta, risk-free rate, MRP), computes numeric cost-of-equity values and re-levered beta, and performs sensitivity and divisional adjustments. The depth of application, validation comments, and scenario analysis meet the standards for a thorough conceptual and applied treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, provides numeric calculation (≈4.58% after tax from ~5.8% pre-tax), uses it in the WACC with market-value weights, and interprets the tax-shield effect across scenarios. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student presents correct formulas and numeric WACC outputs, the strict technical standard requires explicit evidence of personal execution, block-level understanding, and ownership of code; the student explicitly says they generated code with ChatGPT but provides no demonstration of running, verifying, or explaining the code. For that reason, this criterion fails the strict implementation requirement.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student correctly states and applies CAPM and reports numeric Re values, the strict technical requirement demands explicit personal execution, block-by-block understanding, and ownership of code. The transcript only notes the code was generated with ChatGPT and lacks evidence of running, verifying, or explaining the implementation, so it fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the strict technical standard the student must demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block understanding, and ownership of the code/data used to determine market-value weights. The transcript gives market-value numbers but no evidence of running or verifying code, nor an explanation of how those market values were calculated or sourced (only noting ChatGPT generated the code).

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly frames the capital-structure trade-off (tax shield benefits vs. rising financing/rating costs), cites model behavior under different leverage/spread scenarios, and draws clear implications for investment and leverage policy. The explanation links quantitative results to economic trade-offs and managerial recommendations, demonstrating a logical, applied presentation."

Despite some verbal disfluency, the presentation effectively communicates understanding and implications, meeting the criterion for an effective demonstration."
