  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly set the firm's WACC as the hurdle, applied it in discounting and acceptance rules (NPV>0, IRR>WACC), and validated the decision via WACC sensitivity analysis. This demonstrates a thorough, correct use of WACC for investment decision-making consistent with the DRIVER process.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student demonstrates a systematic implementation: defined WACC as the discount input, represented it in the model, ran the calculations and produced outputs (cash-flow schedule, NPV, IRR), and performed explicit WACC sensitivity analysis to test robustness. While the underlying WACC component derivation isn't shown, the Implement criterion emphasizes methodology and systematic execution, which the submission satisfies.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly used WACC as the discount/hurdle rate for capital budgeting, linked NPV/IRR outcomes to shareholder value (valuation), and performed WACC sensitivity testing to assess robustness—demonstrating recognition of WACC's role in both capital budgeting and valuation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the firm's 8.5% WACC as the hurdle and uses it in sensitivity testing, showing conceptual use of WACC in decision-making. However, they do not demonstrate the WACC formula or its component calculation (costs/weights of debt and equity, tax treatment), so the treatment is accurate but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses an 8.5% WACC and tests WACC sensitivity but provides no CAPM calculation or discussion of cost-of-equity components (beta, risk-free rate, market premium). Because the criterion specifically requires calculating equity cost using CAPM and that is missing, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses a corporate tax rate and applies a depreciation tax shield in cash-flow calculations, but provides no calculation or discussion of the cost of debt (interest rate, debt proportion, or after-tax interest treatment) nor the debt tax-shield benefit. Because the required after-tax cost-of-debt calculation is missing, the criterion is not met.",
