These elements show a strong, comprehensive grasp meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, documents and justifies the inputs, computes the numeric result (11.65%), and applies the concept in sensitivity/unlevering analysis. This demonstrates a thorough, accurate treatment of Cost of Equity consistent with PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified inputs (5.8% pre-tax, 21% tax), explained the tax-shield rationale, and computed the after-tax cost (4.58%) which was applied in WACC and scenario analyses.
