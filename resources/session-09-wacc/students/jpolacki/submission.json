  "transcript": "Hi everyone my name is Jacob Polackin and today I'm presenting my strategic analysis for Netflix the objective of this assignment was to consider Netflix's potential massive $5 billion investment into new content and determine if this investment will create value for shareholders to do this we need to calculate the accurate hurdle rate or Weighted Average Cost of Capital which I'll be referring to as WACC throughout the video if the content earns more than this rate the stock price goes up if it earns less we destroy value so I have utilized the DRIVER framework to calculate this rate validated it against peers like Disney and used Python simulations to recommend an optimal capital structure let's begin with the Define and Discover stage before running any code I extracted the correct financial inputs from the assignment and organized them into three different buckets first looking at Bucket A the shareholders equity data we looked at the risk-free rate of 4.5% which is the base rate from the 10-year treasury the market risk premium is 5.5% which is the extra return for market risk and the beta is 1.3 showing that Netflix is 30% more volatile than the market then we moved to Bucket B the debt data or lender cost we can see that Netflix pays a pre-tax yield of 5.8% however the tax rate is 21% this is vital because interest is tax-deductible creating a tax shield that lowers the real cost of borrowing we also have Bucket C which is the capital structure weights the market cap equity value is $200 billion for Netflix and the market value of debt is $13 billion as mentioned in the data for the assignment we are not using the $14 billion book value that was given to us we are strictly using that $13 billion market value the WACC must reflect what it costs to raise capital today not historical accounting figures this puts our current structure at roughly 94% equity and 6% debt moving to the Represent stage this is the logic I used in my Python model for Cost of Equity the formula is Risk-Free Rate plus Beta times the Market Return minus the Risk-Free Rate which is the CAPM concept we are calculating the return shareholders demand for holding a risky asset as seen in the beta of 1.3 compared to a risk-free bond for After-Tax Cost of Debt the concept we are looking at here is the tax shield effect because interest payments are tax-deductible the IRS effectively subsidizes the debt meaning the effective cost is lower than the interest rate paid to bondholders finally for the Weighted Average or WACC we begin by calculating the WACC using current weights of 94% equity to establish a baseline the hypothetical $3 billion issuance allows us to analyze the shift towards target weights or higher debt now to demonstrate the technical implementation in the Implement step this is my code and as you can see when we run it we get these confirmation numbers down here we got a Cost of Equity CAPM of 11.65% the Cost of Debt After-Tax is 4.58% including that tax shield the equity weight is 93.9% and the debt weight is 6.1% combining all of these together we get a current WACC of 11.22% which is the baseline number for the $5 billion investment the assignment asked what happens if we issue $3 billion in debt my code simulates adding $3 billion to the debt pile because we're adding so-called cheap 4.58% debt the chart shows the WACC would drop to 11.13% proving that debt financing is very efficient in this scenario the code also adjusts for project risk for safe US content the hurdle drops to 10.7% and for risky international content it rises to 12.25% looking at the visualization the black bar is Netflix at 11.22% and this gray bar is Disney at 8.2% the visual gap highlights the problem that Netflix is paying a massive premium for capital because unlike Disney it is underleveraged Disney uses 30% debt dragging its WACC down with the tax shield now we move on to the Validate step first we look at the industry benchmark which is 8% to 10% in our analysis Netflix is above that range at 11.22% this is a valid finding because Netflix is a high-growth tech media company with a higher beta of 1.3 compared to traditional media companies it confirms that Netflix is riskier than the average peer for component validation Market vs Book we asked did we inadvertently use book value the answer is no we used the $13 billion market value which is critical because if interest rates have risen lowering the bond price the book value would overstate the true economic weight of debt moving on to the Evolve stage this is the code I used for my Evolve stage and we're going to run it here as we go through it the point of this is to visualize the WACC sensitivity and understand the trade-offs I wrote this advanced script to unlever the beta and simulate what happens if Netflix changes its strategy to allow more debt the gray line is the Cost of Equity notice how it goes up as we add debt shareholders perceive more bankruptcy risk so they demand more return the blue line is the Cost of Debt it stays low at the bottom because of the tax shield finally the red line is the WACC this is the result and notice it slopes down this proves that the benefit of cheap debt outweighs the cost of rising risk the black dot is where we are now which is very expensive the red dot is the $3 billion issuance notice it moves us slightly down the curve this visually confirms that funding the $3 billion investment with debt is the correct strategic move we can also see Disney's strategy which is optimal and much lower which is where we would likely want to be the unlevered asset beta is 1.24 in this scenario which represents the risk of Netflix's content business ignoring debt this is a really cool way to visually show what's going on in this situation finally we are moving on to Reflect where I'm going to talk about my strategic recommendation I've concluded that Netflix should pursue the $3 billion debt issuance and likely continue increasing leverage beyond that my rationale is based on three factors first Cheaper Capital vs Constraints increasing debt from 6% to around 15% would lower the WACC a lower WACC acts as a lower hurdle allowing Netflix to greenlight more content projects however this comes with restraints such as mandatory interest payments that equity does not have second Tax Efficiency the 21% tax rate offers a subsidy on debt that Netflix is currently ignoring third Flexibility equity provides flexibility no risk of default but it dilutes owners and is expensive at 11.65% the final decision on the $5 billion investment is to use the 11.22% WACC as a baseline hurdle if the $5 billion content is US focused lower the hurdle slightly if the return on the investment exceeds these rates proceed the evolved dashboard confirms that funding it with debt is a superior financing choice once again highlighting the Disney optimal strategy shows what happens when a company like this takes on more debt our analysis proved that issuing $3 billion in debt lowers the WACC and our Evolve analysis shows that Netflix is significantly underleveraged compared to a company like Disney by increasing our debt load we would lower our cost of capital utilize the 21% tax subsidy and maximize shareholder value Netflix has the capacity to borrow and it should use that capacity thank you very much",
