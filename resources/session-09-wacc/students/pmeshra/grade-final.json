  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of the WACC formula and its components (weights, CAPM for r_e, after-tax r_d), implements these in code with explicit inputs, and interprets results with sensitivity and peer comparisons. The work is detailed, applied (project-level WACCs, debt issuance effect), and aligns with validation and evolution stages, satisfying the PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements CAPM, uses appropriate inputs to compute a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and applies it to both firm- and project-level analyses. The clear formula presentation, coding implementation, and application across scenarios demonstrate thorough understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and implements the after-tax cost of debt (r_d*(1−T)), computes the numeric after-tax rate (4.58%), and demonstrates the tax-shield benefit via WACC changes and sensitivity analysis. The clear formula representation, coding implementation, and applied interpretation across scenarios meet the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performs external validation by comparing results to peer WACCs and an industry range and interprets the differences, showing purposeful validation. However, they do not cite specific external sources/tools (e.g., databases or websites) used to obtain the peer numbers, so the validation is correct but not fully documented, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly recognizes that moderate additional debt can lower WACC and that different projects merit different hurdle rates, demonstrating applied insight. However, the discussion stops short of a thorough optimal-capital-structure analysis (no explicit trade-off discussion, target leverage, quantified limits, or firm-level financing recommendation), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student clearly explains the primary trade-off (debt lowers WACC via a tax shield) and demonstrates it with a sensitivity analysis and interpretation. However, the discussion stops short of a thorough trade-off analysis — it lacks explicit treatment of increased financial distress risk, the mechanics of rising equity cost with leverage (levered beta adjustments), or a quantified optimal leverage target — so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",
