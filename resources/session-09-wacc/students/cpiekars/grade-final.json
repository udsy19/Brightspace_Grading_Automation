  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents correct WACC components and formulas, implements them in code with concrete inputs, computes current and post‑debt WACC and project‑specific rates, and interprets the implications. This comprehensive, applied treatment demonstrates a strong, thorough understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements the CAPM (rf + beta*MRP), computes the correct numeric cost of equity (11.65% given the inputs), and validates the result in context. The combination of formula representation, coded implementation, and validation demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly presents and implements the after‑tax cost of debt formula, computes the numeric after‑tax rate (5.8%*(1–0.21)=4.58%), incorporates it into WACC, and interprets the tax‑shield/leveraging effect on WACC and financing strategy. This applied, validated treatment demonstrates thorough understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performs limited sensitivity checks (one incremental debt scenario and two project‑beta cases) and implements/prints results, showing understanding that WACC responds to capital structure and beta. However, this is not a thorough sensitivity analysis (no ranges, tornado table, or systematic parameter sweep), so the work demonstrates partial but incomplete coverage of the criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly cross‑checks results against industry ranges and peer company figures and interprets those comparisons, showing validation effort. However, they do not cite external sources or tools used to verify peer/industry numbers (only restate provided context), so validation is present but not externally documented—hence PARTIAL.",
