  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax debt, market-value weights), applies them to compute current and post-debt WACC scenarios, and validates/interprets results versus peers and external data. Their implementation and reflection show a thorough, conceptually sound treatment that meets the moderate standard for depth and application.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly used automated tooling (Google Colab + AI-generated code) to calculate WACC scenarios, reported concrete outputs (pre/post $3B debt), and described how the process can be updated/automated for future runs. That demonstrates meaningful integration of finance and technology at a level that satisfies the moderate standard for this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly and explicitly defines the cost‑of‑capital problem and the Netflix financing decision, listing targeted questions and a concrete analytic plan. This direct articulation of objective, scope, and approach satisfies the strict requirement for the Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM as the method for cost of equity and supplies relevant inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market premium) and implements code to produce WACC scenarios, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not show an explicit CAPM calculation or the standalone cost-of-equity result nor discuss assumptions/adjustments in depth, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses the key inputs (bond yield, tax rate) and states they compute after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield effect, and they produce pre/post-debt WACC results. However, they do not show an explicit after-tax cost-of-debt calculation or discuss assumptions (e.g., treatment of marginal vs. existing rates), so the treatment is correct but somewhat basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the tax‑shield concept—using after‑tax cost of debt and showing a pre/post‑debt WACC decline—demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the explicit after‑tax calculation or quantify the tax‑shield mechanics (e.g., (1–Tc) multiplication or marginal vs. embedded rates), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student correctly describes the WACC methodology, lists concrete inputs, and reports/justifies scenario outputs, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not present the explicit CAPM/after‑tax debt calculations or detailed assumptions and derivations, so the explanation is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS."
