  "transcript": "Good afternoon today our objective is to conduct a highly granular valuation of Netflix's minimum cost of capital establishing the hurdle rate necessary for the five billion dollar content investment we anchor our process in the driver framework beginning with find and discover now the WACC is essentially a blended financial tool that translates investor requirements into corporate action starting with the market value mandate we explicitly use market values of two hundred billion in equity and thirteen billion in debt rejecting book values because they are historical measures that violate the fundamental financial principle that required returns must be based on current economic value and future cash flows for the WACC model simplification we employ the assumption that the three billion dollar marginal debt issuance is insignificant enough not to trigger a material change in the market perception of our equity risk therefore the equity beta is held constant at one point three across both scenarios allowing us to isolate and study the pure tax shield effects regarding our parameters the risk-free rate is four point five percent the market risk premium is five point five percent and the corporate tax rate is twenty-one percent next we move to the R phase focusing on the cost of equity using the CAPM foundation the cost of equity is derived using the capital asset pricing model a shared equilibrium model that prices risk only for its systematic component calculating this as the risk-free rate plus beta times the market risk premium which represents the compensation the market demands for bearing average systematic risk looking at the security market line our calculation of eleven point sixty-five percent is the point where Netflix with a beta of one point three plots on the line meaning investors require eleven point sixty-five percent to compensate for the risk Netflix adds to a diverse portfolio interpreting that beta of one point three means Netflix is thirty percent more volatile than the market portfolio making the cost of equity our highest cost component next we look at the cost of debt where the complexity lies in the tax shield the pre-tax cost or yield to maturity on our bonds is five point eight percent but since interest expense is deductible from taxable income it effectively creates a tax subsidy from the government the twenty-one percent tax rate acts as a discount on our interest payments making our after-tax cost equal to the pre-tax rate times one minus the tax rate resulting in a tax shield of one point twenty-two percent and a confirmed effective cost of debt of four point fifty-eight percent this substantial difference between the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt is the primary engine of our capital structure analysis moving down to the implement phase we weight these costs together for scenario one which is our current state using ninety-three point nine percent equity and six point one percent debt the WACC is eleven point twenty-two percent in scenario two by shifting to seven point forty-one percent debt with the new issuance we substitute a higher portion of our cost equity with low-cost debt yielding a WACC of eleven point thirteen percent a nine basis point drop achieved purely through the weighting effect of the tax shield looking at our chart validation the visualization confirms that the WACC decrease is solely due to the shift in capital structure weight with the cost of equity remaining constant and as you can see in the second chart the increase in debt weight results in a clear decrease in WACC validating the tax shield effect under constant risk our sensitivity analysis checks this against volatility showing that a one percent rise in the market risk premium pushes WACC up to twelve point twenty-five percent proving that WACC is a sensitive estimation requiring careful communication to the board next we move to the strategic synthesis part of our driver formula the corporate WACC of eleven point thirteen percent is only appropriate for the average project so for specific investments we must use a project-specific WACC if the risk differs from the firm's average beta we propose two adjustments first for high-risk projects we adjust beta upwards to one point five resulting in a necessary hurdle rate of twelve point twenty-five percent to avoid incorrectly accepting value-destroying projects second for low-risk projects we adjust beta downwards to one point two two resulting in a hurdle of ten point seventy-four percent preventing us from incorrectly rejecting stable value-creating projects currently our WACC is substantially higher than Disney's eight point two percent which is a competitive handicap stemming from our underleveraged capital structure so our final recommendation is to accept the three billion dollar debt but set an aggressive target weight of twenty to twenty-five percent debt to secure low-cost capital maximizing our ability to accept positive NPV projects and enhance our total shareholder value thank you for your time",
