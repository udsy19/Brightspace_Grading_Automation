  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, correct treatment of WACC: market-value weights, CAPM-derived cost of equity with numeric inputs, explicit pre- and after-tax cost of debt and tax-shield effect, and computed WACCs for alternative capital structures with sensitivity discussion. These elements and the DRIVER-stage structure demonstrate strong conceptual and applied mastery consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, provides numeric inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market premium), computes a specific cost of equity (11.65%), and interprets the beta’s meaning and implications. The DRIVER stages show both methodological anchoring and applied calculation plus interpretation, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the after-tax cost formula, provides numeric inputs and computed results (5.8% pre-tax → 4.58% after-tax; tax shield ≈1.22%), and integrates this into scenario WACC calculations, demonstrating both technical accuracy and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The transcript shows calculated WACC values, charts, and DRIVER-stage work but contains no explicit evidence of automation (no code, spreadsheet formulas, scripts, or statements like \"I ran\" or \"automated\"). Visualization and computed numbers alone do not demonstrate automation, so the criterion is not met.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student clearly presents the benefit side (tax-shield, numerical WACC reduction, and a leverage target) and links it to capital-budgeting outcomes, demonstrating systematic analysis. However, discussion of the trade-offs is incomplete — limited treatment of increased financial risk, potential beta or distress effects, and other costs of higher leverage — so the presentation is correct and useful but not fully balanced or thorough.",
