  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, numerically supported understanding of WACC components and calculation: they state correct formulas (CAPM and after-tax debt), use market values for weighting, compute and interpret numeric WACC results, and run a pro-forma sensitivity. They also acknowledge model limitations and necessary adjustments (Hamada, rating effects), meeting the criteria for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, selects and documents inputs (Rf, beta, MRP), computes a numeric cost of equity (~11.6%), and integrates it into the WACC model. They also critique assumptions and propose appropriate refinements (Hamada re-levering), demonstrating a thorough, operational understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax debt formula, uses concrete inputs (5.8% pre-tax yield, tax rate) and computes an after-tax cost (~4.6%), integrates it into the WACC, and quantifies the tax-shield benefit (WACC ↓ ~9.2 bps). They also critically discuss model limitations (credit-rating impact), demonstrating thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed a model (with reported numeric outputs) and documented all WACC components and the scenario workflow, which shows partial technical implementation. However, per the STRICT rubric they did not demonstrate block-by-block ownership or explain the code/functions they ran (they attribute code generation to Gemini and give no line‑by‑line explanation or explicit verification steps), so full credit cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed a CAPM implementation (ran code in Colab and reported a numeric cost of equity) and described the code structure at a high level, satisfying partial technical execution. However, per the STRICT rubric they did not provide block‑by‑block ownership or detailed explanation of the code/functions (they attribute code generation to Gemini and give no line‑level walkthrough), so full credit cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market values and produced numeric current and pro‑forma weights, demonstrating correct methodology in practice. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation or detailed ownership of the implementation (the code was generated by Gemini and no line‑level verification or walkthrough was shown), so the work meets partial but not full technical-credit requirements.",
