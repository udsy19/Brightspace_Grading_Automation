  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components (costs of equity and debt, tax shield, capital weights, beta adjustments), implemented and validated computations, and used multiple applications (project-specific WACCs, sensitivity, peer comparison), meeting the criteria for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated a specific cost of equity, adjusted it for additional leverage, and validated results by hand and in code, demonstrating applied use of CAPM and beta re-levering across scenarios. Minor wording (e.g., \"after tax\" on cost of equity) is a small imprecision, but overall the treatment is thorough with multiple applications and validations, meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, calculated a numeric Rd (4.5%), incorporated it into WACC, validated results by hand and in code, and ran sensitivity/interpretation showing the tax-shield effect and its offset by beta-driven equity cost increases. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed code, produced numeric WACC results (11.22) and validated them with hand calculations, demonstrating correct implementation and verification. However, per the STRICT technical standard, the submission lacks explicit block-by-block explanation of the code/functions and detailed ownership of each implementation step, so it does not meet the full PASS requirement.\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed a CAPM-based implementation (code run in Colab) and validated the numeric cost-of-equity by hand, demonstrating personal execution and verification. However, they did not provide the required strict-level, block-by-block explanation or explicit function-level ownership of the CAPM code, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and validated capital weights (e.g., 93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) and ran code plus hand-checks, showing partial technical execution. However, per the STRICT requirement they did not explicitly show how market values were determined (no statement of market cap vs. book debt, no block-by-block code explanation or ownership of each calculation), so the submission falls short of a full PASS.",
