  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explains the WACC components, shows the correct formulas (CAPM for equity, tax-adjusted debt, market-value weights), computes numeric results, and runs sensitivity scenarios (additional debt, higher beta for international projects). The work is detailed, numerically supported, and includes validation and reflection, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM, provided and applied correct numerical inputs, computed the cost of equity correctly (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%), and demonstrated application and interpretation across scenarios. The treatment is specific, numerically supported, and connected to broader analysis, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified the pre-tax cost of debt (5.8%) and the corporate tax rate (21%), explicitly stated the need to adjust debt for the tax shield, implemented the after-tax calculation in Python (resulting in ~4.58% used in WACC), and validated implications via scenario analysis—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly included all WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, pre-tax bond yield adjusted for tax, market-value weights) and reported numeric results computed in Python, demonstrating substantive technical understanding. However, under the strict technical-implementation standard the submission lacks explicit block-by-block code explanations, a direct statement of running/verifying code, and clear ownership of implementation—so the work is correct but not demonstrated with the explicit technical evidence required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually, provided inputs, and reported the computed cost of equity (11.65%), showing functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, an unambiguous statement of running/verifying code, or detailed ownership of implementation—so the evidence supports a partial rather than full pass.\n- Technical Implementation: The student collected and used explicit market-value inputs and described computing total firm value and weight calculations, demonstrating correct methodology. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block-by-block code explanation or an explicit statement of running/verifying the code, so the implementation evidence is incomplete—hence PARTIAL.",
