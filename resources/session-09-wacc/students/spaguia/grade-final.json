  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes and applies the WACC formula components (Re, Rd(1−T), market weights), computes numeric WACCs (current and post‑debt), runs sensitivity and peer comparisons, and draws finance‑theory conclusions about tax shields and leverage. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies CAPM components, implements the cost‑of‑equity formula in code, and reports a concrete Re (11.65%) integrated into WACC and peer analysis. This shows applied and thorough understanding beyond a brief mention, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses the after‑tax cost‑of‑debt formula, reports a numeric after‑tax Rd (4.58%), implements the post‑issuance calculation, and interprets the tax‑shield benefit (WACC reduction). This demonstrates a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented WACC components in code, produced numeric WACC outputs, and included validation steps, demonstrating correct computational elements. Under the STRICT technical rubric, they did not explicitly state personal execution/verification or provide block‑level explanations (and they relied on AI for re‑runs), so the work shows correct implementation but lacks the explicit ownership/detail required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student documents CAPM inputs and that cost‑of‑equity formulas were placed in code and reports numeric outputs, they do not explicitly state that they ran and verified the code themselves, nor do they provide block‑by‑block explanations or ownership (they indicate rerunning via AI). Under the STRICT technical rubric requiring explicit demonstration of personal execution and detailed code understanding, the evidence is insufficient, so the criterion fails.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market‑value formulas (E/V, D/V) and reports calculated weights, demonstrating correct methodology and results. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution, block‑by‑block explanation, or full ownership (they reference AI reruns), so the evidence supports a correct but incomplete (PARTIAL) implementation.",
