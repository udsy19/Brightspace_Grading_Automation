  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC components (cost of equity via CAPM, pre/post-tax cost of debt, market weights) and computes numeric WACC values with a leverage sensitivity test. They also perform validation checks and interpret implications, showing thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the MODERATE standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC as the investment hurdle, computes numeric WACC values, and applies them to decision-making (including project-specific adjustments and peer checks). This shows a clear, applied understanding suitable for a PASS under the MODERATE standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student implemented an automated WACC calculator (code present, inputs fed, outputs produced) and used it to run a leverage scenario with numeric results, demonstrating practical integration of finance and technology. They also outline sensible extensions, indicating meaningful automation rather than purely manual calculation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies a CAPM-based cost of equity (numeric result used in WACC) and recognizes adjustments (beta, country premium). However, the submission lacks a clear breakdown of CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, explicit beta) and deeper sensitivity/examples, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculates and applies the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% pre-tax → 4.582% after tax) and uses it in WACC computations, demonstrating correct procedural use. However, discussion of the tax-shield benefit is brief and lacks deeper analysis (e.g., marginal cost of debt, changing credit risk, or explicit quantification of the tax shield), so the treatment is accurate but not thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies interest deductibility by converting pre-tax debt (5.8%) to an after-tax cost (4.582%) and uses it in WACC calculations, showing procedural understanding. However, they offer only brief interpretation and no deeper discussion of the tax-shield mechanics, valuation impact, or sensitivity to changing tax rates/credit risk, so the treatment is accurate but not thorough.",
