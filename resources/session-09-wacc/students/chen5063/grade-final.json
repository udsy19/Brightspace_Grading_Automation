  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the WACC components and formula, computed CAPM cost of equity (11.65%), after-tax cost of debt (5.8%·(1–0.21)), market-value weights, and derived WACC (11.22%), then interpreted and applied it to project decisions. Minor wording/typo issues do not impair the clear, thorough conceptual and computational treatment, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula with given inputs to compute cost of equity (11.65%), and discusses how beta affects equity cost across peers and projects. Implementation and reflection evidence show both computational accuracy and applied understanding, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the after-tax debt formula and computed 4.582%, explicitly explained why debt is cheaper via the tax shield, and used this to analyze peer differences and capital-structure adjustments. Implementation and reflection evidence show both computational accuracy and applied understanding, meeting the PASS threshold.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed correct components and reported a WACC, showing conceptual and numeric competence. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, step-by-step calculation or independent validation (they cite Google Gemini), so the submission meets correctness partly but lacks the required explicit implementation/ownership for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and applies the CAPM formula and reports a plausible numeric result, showing conceptual understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, step-by-step arithmetic or ownership (they reference Google Gemini), so the implementation is only partially validated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly computed the weights numerically from the given values (200/213 and 13/213), demonstrating basic implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show how the market values were determined/verified (sources or debt market valuation) nor fully own/verify the calculation (they reference Google Gemini), so the implementation is only partially demonstrated.",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, numeric example showing how increased leverage lowers WACC, explains why debt is cheaper (tax shield), and explicitly acknowledges the countervailing risk of financial distress—linking these to shareholder-value implications. That balanced, example-based discussion meets the standards for a thorough presentation of capital-structure trade-offs."
