  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM to compute cost of equity, adjusted cost of debt for taxes, and weighted components by market-value capital structure to calculate WACC (with explicit numeric results), demonstrating thorough and applied understanding. Minor inconsistencies in reported scenario numbers slightly weaken polish but do not undermine the clear, correct treatment of the WACC formula and its components.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes WACC, reports numeric baseline and scenario values, and uses the resulting WACC changes to recommend capital-structure action and assess the $5B investment — demonstrating applied use of WACC as a hurdle rate. The work includes scenario analysis and an explicit recommendation, meeting the thorough applied standard for this criterion.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated WACC computation using Python functions (CAPM and WACC), ran scenario recalculations, and produced sensitivity plots, demonstrating practical automation and integration of finance and technology. The implementation is applied and used to inform decisions, meeting the moderate standard for this criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs and produced a plausible cost-of-equity figure, showing clear conceptual understanding and implementation. However the treatment is brief (single calculation, limited discussion of assumptions or sensitivity), so it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes interest tax deductibility and computes an after-tax cost of debt (5.8% → 4.58%) and uses the tax shield in WACC analysis, showing applied understanding. However the treatment is brief (no explicit tax rate or derivation and limited discussion of assumptions/sensitivity), so it meets a correct but incomplete standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies interest deductibility and applies an after-tax adjustment (5.8% → 4.58%) and uses the tax shield in WACC and recommendation, demonstrating applied understanding. However, the explanation is brief (no explicit tax rate, derivation, or sensitivity analysis), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly states the objective and gathers inputs for the analysis.  \nImplement — explains the modeling approach (Python CAPM/WACC functions) and reports computed component values.  \nEvolve/Report — presents scenario results, visualization, and a clear recommendation linking findings to strategy.",
      "reasoning": "The video presents a logical structure (goal, inputs, methodology, results, recommendation), explains key concepts (CAPM, tax deductibility), and uses scenario analysis and visuals to support conclusions, demonstrating clear understanding. Minor disfluencies and small numeric inconsistencies do not undermine the overall effective communication of the analysis and recommendation."
