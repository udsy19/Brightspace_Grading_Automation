  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula, correctly defines CAPM for cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt, computes weights and numeric WACC outcomes, and runs sensitivity/peer analyses. Their implementation and validation steps show a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and implications, meeting the threshold for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, applies it with given inputs and produces a plausible numeric result (11.65%). They further validate and reflect on differences versus external estimates, showing a thorough, applied understanding of cost-of-equity calculation and its implications.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, computes a plausible numeric result (4.58%), and explicitly explains the tax-deductibility (tax shield) benefit and its inclusion in WACC. They also validated the result against external ranges, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes all WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and reports computed numeric outputs and validation—evidence of correct calculation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit stepwise execution notes, or clear ownership of the code (no detailed walkthrough of functions/logic), so the implementation is correct but not demonstrated to the required explicit level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, produces a numeric result (11.65%) and compares it to external estimates, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide an explicit run/verification statement or a block-by-block explanation of the code, so the implementation is not demonstrated at the required explicit level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values, computed total capital and produced correct numeric weights (including the updated case), demonstrating understanding of the method. Under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit evidence of running/verifying the code or a block‑by‑block explanation/ownership of the implementation, so full credit is not warranted.",
