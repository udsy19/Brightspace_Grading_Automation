  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a comprehensive, stepwise explanation of WACC (market-value weights, CAPM for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, blending formula), provides a numeric example and code implementation, and applies WACC as a hurdle rate with verification/sensitivity checks. These elements demonstrate thorough mastery beyond a basic description, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the CAPM formula, applies numeric inputs (r_f, beta, market risk premium) and implements it in code, then uses and verifies the resulting cost of equity in WACC and decision-making. This combination of correct formula, concrete example, implementation, and verification meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student states the correct after‑tax debt formula, applies it with specific numbers in a worked example and code, and verifies sensitivity to tax changes—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of the cost of debt and its tax‑shield effect.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student describes the correct formula and says they wrote code, but does not explicitly demonstrate running the code, provide block‑by‑block explanation, or verify/justify the numeric WACC (the claimed ~9% is unsupported and inconsistent with the given inputs). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and ownership, the evidence is insufficient.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student correctly describes CAPM and claims an implementation, they do not demonstrate having run the code, show code blocks or explain functions, nor present verified outputs. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and ownership, the evidence is insufficient.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes how to determine market values and the weight formulas and provides an implementation claim plus an example weight (40/60). However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show running code, block‑by‑block explanation, or evidence that the example weights were computed from market data — so the work is correct in method but lacks the explicit execution/verification required for a PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student correctly identifies key trade‑offs (tax shield vs. higher equity cost, sensitivity to interest rates) and links them to WACC, showing conceptual understanding. However the treatment is high‑level without quantitative trade‑off analysis, decision rules, or explicit recommendations, so it is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS."

        "\"The steps there's five steps which are the first one is to find the market value of equity... Fourth, I estimate the component costs. To do that, the cost of equity for from CAPM, we use this formula, which is risk-free rate plus beta times market risk premium. Then the cost of depth is the current yield on debt and the after tax cost of depth would be cost of depth times 1 minus the tax rate.\"",

I compare project alpha which is 50%... project beta is also larger than WACC... but project gamma... is 9% almost the same as WACC... so based on WACC alpha and beta look much better than gamma.\""

      "reasoning": "The presentation is structured, covers method, inputs, implementation, validation, and applies outcomes to a concrete decision—demonstrating clear understanding and effective communication. The combination of a stepwise framework, coded implementation, numerical example, sensitivity checks, and a decision‑making conclusion satisfies the PASS standard."
