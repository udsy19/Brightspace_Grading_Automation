  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components—explicitly using CAPM for equity, calculating after-tax debt cost, producing a numeric WACC, and running sensitivity/project-specific rates. Implementation and reflection evidence (calculations, peer comparison, and recommendations) support a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs and produced a precise cost-of-equity (11.65%), then used project-specific adjustments (US and international) and integrated those results into WACC analysis and recommendations. Implementation and reflection evidence show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and explained the after-tax cost of debt (5.82% → ~4.58%) and explicitly linked interest deductibility to lower WACC, used sensitivity analysis to quantify tax-shield benefits, and made concrete recommendations—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct component values (CAPM equity, after‑tax debt) and a final WACC with sensitivity and application, demonstrating partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit, reproducible implementation details (no block‑by‑block methodology, code/run verification, or stepwise weight calculations), so the work cannot be fully validated—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student applied CAPM correctly (Rf 4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%) and used those inputs in downstream analysis, showing technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit, reproducible implementation details (no step‑by‑step calculation breakdown, code/run verification, or block‑level explanation of execution), so the criterion is only partially satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided the market-value inputs (equity market cap and market debt) and reported the resulting weight (≈6.1%), indicating correct application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show an explicit, step‑by‑step calculation, code/run verification, or block‑level methodology for deriving the weights, so the evidence supports only a partial demonstration.",
