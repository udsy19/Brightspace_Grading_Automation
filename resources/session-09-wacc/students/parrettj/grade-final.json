  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies WACC components (weights e/v and d/v), the CAPM form for cost of equity, the effect of leverage on cost of equity and debt, and the tax-shield rationale, and they implemented formulas and a graph and reflected on limitations. These elements demonstrate a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the objective and context (Netflix financing) and clearly explained core concepts (WACC as required return, leverage) while producing a representative graph and reflecting on assumptions. These explicit Discover and Represent artifacts satisfy the strict requirement for Define & Discover.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student followed a systematic workflow: defined the problem, applied WACC components/formulas, swept leverage to produce a chart with numeric endpoints, and interpreted the sensitivity (including tax-shield and risk effects). While not exhaustively detailed, the implemented graph-plus-formula approach and reflective validation constitute a coherent, methodical sensitivity analysis, satisfying the Implement criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM form for cost of equity and included it among the implemented formulas, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not apply CAPM with numeric inputs, worked examples, or detailed calculation steps, and acknowledged model limitations—so the treatment is correct but basic, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the tax-shield concept and that after-tax debt cost is lower, and they included formulas in their implementation, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they did not show the explicit after-tax cost formula (kd*(1−t)), numerical examples, or a detailed calculation—so the treatment is correct but basic, earning PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the tax-shield concept and included it among their formulas, demonstrating conceptual understanding. They did not, however, show the explicit after-tax debt formula (kd*(1−t)) or numeric application; treatment is accurate but basic, so PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student communicates the core ideas (graphical result, WACC components, CAPM, tax shield) and reflects on limitations, demonstrating understanding. Presentation is informal and sometimes uncertain (fillers, hedging, no polished walkthrough or clear examples), so it conveys competence but lacks clarity and polish required for a full PASS."
