  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the WACC formula, computes CAPM-based cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt, uses market-value weights, and implements the calculation (including a Python verification), demonstrating thorough understanding and application. Minor wording/typo inconsistencies do not undermine the correct methodology and interpretation, so the work meets the threshold for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, plugs in Rf, beta, and market risk premium to get 11.65%, and verifies it in code. They also demonstrate awareness of appropriate inputs (market values) and adjustments (project-specific/asset betas), indicating thorough and accurate treatment of the cost-of-equity criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly specifies and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula (RD*(1–T)), computes the numeric value (4.582%), integrates it into the WACC calculation and verifies results in code. They also interpret the impact of additional debt on WACC (demonstrating the tax-shield/treatment in practice), meeting the standards for a thorough, applied treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes all WACC components correctly and reports verified WACC results, but under the STRICT technical rubric they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code understanding, or ownership (they state they asked an AI to produce code without explaining running it or each code section). Correctness is present, but required explicit implementation ownership is missing, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM and reports the numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and verifies it in code, demonstrating technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical rubric they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block understanding, or ownership of the code (they state they asked an AI to produce code without explaining running it or its components), so the submission is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly determines market values (Equity $200B, Debt $13B) and computes weights (≈93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) and integrates them into the WACC, demonstrating technical correctness.
