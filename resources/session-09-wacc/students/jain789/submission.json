  "transcript": "Hi everyone, this is session nine assignment. In this assignment, we're going to calculate the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix in connection with the hypothetical 5 billion context investment decision. We're going to determine current WACCC, evaluate the impact additional debt financing, assess project versus firmwide discount rates and Netflix cost of capital to industry peers. Now, in order to do that, let's first figure out what weighted average cost of capital really means so that we have a good analysis. So WACC is the minimum return a company must earn on a new asset investment to create value for its shareholders. It serves as a hurdle rate for the hypothetical $5 billion investment. Core assumptions market value weights are calculated using market values for both equity and debt as market values reflect true economic proportions. Cost of debt simplicity. The pre-tax cost of debt for the new three um trillion dollars insurance is assumed to remain at 5.8%. the current bond yield. For simplicity, adearing the KISS principle. A larger insuence could possibly increase the yield, but this is ignored for the initial calculations. Equity value, the market capitalization, 200 billion is assumed to remain constant immediately after the debt issuance for the WHC model. For preferred stock, there's none mentioned. So, we're just going to ignore that. So, component cost calculations, cost of equity is CAPM is, you know, R plus B times MRP. The calculations is going to end up being 11.65%. And then after tax cost of death is going to end up being 4.58%. For our required analysis, um, calculate Netflix current WACC scenario one, we're going to use these following numbers. 200 billion for the market value, 13 billion for the market value of debt, 213 billion total capital, equity weight 93.9%, debt weight 6.10%. Our current WACC calculations after inputting all that end up being 11.21%. So from there we're able to see that Netflix current WACC is 11.21%. Now if we use scenario 2 where we determine WAC after $3 million debt there's a new capital structure. So with that the debt uh the market debt would be 16 billion. The new cap the total capital would be 216 billion. New equity weight would be 92.6% and the new weight would be 7.41%. And from there we see that the WACC would be 11.13% and a 0.08% difference. WAC slightly decreases to 11.13% after the additional debt insuence. This demonstrates the tax shield effect where substituting higher equity with lower tax capital. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to Gemini and we're going to run our code to make sure it works and then from there we're going to be able to see the more in-depth calculations of how it worked. So from right here you can see scenario one the current WACC baseline where we're able to figure out that and from scenario two we see WCC with $3 billion additional debt and from there we can see that the cost of exclude equity is 11.65%. After taxes tax is 4.58%. Total firm value is 22 213 billion and from there Netflix current is 11.22 and then if we do it with $3 million there's $3 billion additional debt. Netflix leverage is 11.2%. So our D our numbers are a little bit different but they're very similar and we know that for sure that there is a slight decrease from here to here which we also see from Gemini as well. Moving forward evaluate project specific WACC. The recommendation Netflix should not use the firm's wide WACC of 11.13% for all content investment. It should use a project specific WACC. Using the 11.13% as a hurdle, it would lead to subsidiz accepting risky projects. High-risisk projects might be incorrectly accepted if their true cost of capital is higher than 11.13%. US content. This segment is likely to have a lower revenue volatility and a more established audience. It should be a lower beta and consequentially a lower project specific WACC. For international content, it's a higher risk as a segment involves currency risk, political risk, and often unproven audience taste profiles. It have a higher beta and a higher project specific WACC. Compare Netflix to Disney and explain differences. Now, the Netflix um calculated WACCC is 11.13% and we're given that Disney is 8.2%. Amazon Prime is about 9.5%. Debt weight, as you can see, is Disney is a lot higher at 30%. equity weight. We can see that Netflix is a lot higher at 93% compared to 70%. But then they both have industry ranges of 8 to 10%. Now let's go into further analysis. For the capital structure, the most significant differences is the use of debt where Disney uses 30% benefiting extensively from the tax yield which drastically lowers um its WACC. Netflix despite the new insuence remains high equity finance 7.41% 41% debt resulting in a higher WACC because the ex equity is inherently more expensive. Netflix calculated WAC's 11.3%. The higher the cost is due to the equity beta of 1.3. Now recommendations Netflix has strategically increases debt leverage to closer to its media industry peers of 15 to 20%. Now why is this? Because minimum is WAC the calculation show increasing debt from 6 to 7% lower WACC from 11.21 21 to 11.13. By gradually increasing debt, Netflix can continue to reduce its WACCC and increase its NPV of its content projects. And obviously, you want to have a higher NPV as we've learned. Leverage threshold with a BBB plus rating. Netflix is currently a safe borrower. Has significantly capacity to take on more debt before the cost of debt rises due to financial distress. Given the need for consistent massive content investment, losing a low debt is financially prudent. And in conclusion, the content investment should proceed using its increased debts insurance and the project evaluation should be conducted appropriate project spec specific WACC rather than a firmwide 11.13%. Thank you so much for listening and I hope you have a wonderful day",
