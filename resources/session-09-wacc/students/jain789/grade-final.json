  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified WACC components (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt), produced numerical WACC calculations and scenario analysis, and interpreted implications (tax shield, project-specific rates). Coverage is applied and specific rather than merely cursory, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported a pre-tax and an explicit after-tax cost of debt, executed scenario analysis showing WACC falling with more debt, and explicitly attributed the effect to the tax shield—demonstrating both calculation and interpretation. While the explicit tax rate used isn't shown, the numerical application and multiple examples (scenario and peer comparison) provide a thorough, correct treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported both pre-tax (5.8%) and after-tax (4.58%) cost of debt, demonstrated the numerical WACC decline under additional debt, and explicitly attributed the change to the tax shield—showing calculation and interpretation. Though the exact tax rate derivation wasn't shown, the applied numbers, scenario analysis, and reflection provide a thorough, correct treatment consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and used the CAPM formula and produced a plausible numeric cost of equity, demonstrating applied understanding (Implement) and interpretation of beta (Reflect). However, they did not show the specific inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, or beta derivation) or work-through, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than the thorough, detailed explanation required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct component values and WACC results, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they failed to explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, provide block-level explanations, or show flowchart/planning and ownership of the implementation—so the work is correct but lacks the explicit technical validation required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly named and applied CAPM conceptually and produced a plausible numeric cost of equity, and referenced beta as a driver—showing partial technical competence. However, under the STRICT implementation standard they did not provide explicit inputs (risk-free rate, MRP, beta source), code, block-by-block explanation, or clear personal execution/verification, so the work falls short of a full PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Framed the capital-structure question and role of WACC as a decision metric.\n- Implement: Ran and reported a concrete scenario showing how a modest increase in debt changes WACC (quantified 0.08% reduction).\n- Reflect/Evolve: Interpreted trade-offs (tax-shield benefit vs. distress risk), compared to peers, and made a specific financing recommendation with constraints (BBB+ threshold).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the capital-structure trade-offs with numeric evidence (scenario showing WACC change), explains the mechanism (tax shield), compares peers, and balances benefits against costs (financial distress/credit rating). This combination of quantitative example, causal explanation, and actionable recommendation meets the standard for a logical, well-reasoned presentation."

Coverage includes definitions, examples, outputs, and interpretation, so it demonstrates solid understanding and clear communication."
