This comprehensive and applied coverage meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides explicit CAPM inputs and a numeric cost-of-equity result, implements the calculation in code, and demonstrates sensitivity/validation (beta changes and their WACC effects). This depth and applied testing meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes the after‑tax cost of debt with numeric inputs, implements it in code, and demonstrates its effect via scenario/sensitivity analysis while linking to financial theory (tax shield benefit). This comprehensive, applied treatment meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student runs and compares numeric WACC outputs against industry ranges and peer company values, demonstrating result validation. However, they did not cite specific external sources or tools used for the benchmarks (e.g., databases, reports, calculators), so the validation is substantive but lacks the explicit external references required for a full PASS.",
