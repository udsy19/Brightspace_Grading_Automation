  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, specific grasp of WACC components (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium, CAPM cost of equity, pre/post-tax cost of debt, market weights) and computes numeric WACC values and leverage-adjusted equity beta. They also apply the concept to scenarios (debt issuance, project-specific rates, peer comparison) and reflect on implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies CAPM with stated inputs and computes cost of equity (11.65%), then re‑derives the levered beta and updated cost (11.73%) after new debt, and discusses implications—showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the pre‑tax debt rate, explicitly applies the 21% tax rate to derive an after‑tax cost (~4.58%), and discusses the tax‑shield and its impact on WACC and capital‑structure strategy. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies correct inputs and computed WACC components (CAPM, after‑tax debt, weights) and references a Python implementation, showing partial technical execution. However, they do not explicitly state they ran/verified the code, nor provide a detailed, block‑by‑block explanation or ownership of the implementation, so the strict technical criterion is not fully satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies the CAPM formula with explicit inputs and reports numeric results, including re‑levering beta, showing conceptual and computational understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block‑by‑block code explanation/verification (e.g., \"I ran and tested the function\" or detailed code walkthrough), so the requirement for full technical ownership is not fully met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly chooses market values (debt = $13bn, equity = $200bn) and reports the resulting weights, showing correct methodology for market-value weighting. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not demonstrate personal execution or provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough or explicit verification (\"I ran and tested this function\"), so full technical ownership is not shown.",
