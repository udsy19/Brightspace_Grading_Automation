  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and explains WACC components (CAPM inputs for equity, yield and tax adjustment for debt, and market-value weights), implements the calculation and scenario testing, and validates outcomes versus industry ranges. This breadth and the applied sensitivity/validation work demonstrate a thorough, correct understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs, implements the cost-of-equity computation in code, and performs sensitivity analysis (including beta) and validation against industry ranges. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes after-tax cost of debt and the tax-deductibility adjustment, implements it in code including a debt-issuance scenario, and interprets the tax-shield impact on WACC. The combination of conceptual explanation, applied implementation, and validation supports a thorough, PASS-level response.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates execution (ran Python) and describes what the script does and validates outputs, but does not provide the required strict-level, block-by-block explanation or explicit ownership of the generated code (beyond showing the AI prompt). That combination supports PARTIAL: correct implementation effort and validation are present, but explicit technical detail and ownership required for PASS are missing.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs, executed code to compute cost of equity, and validated outputs. However, under the strict technical standard they did not present a clear block‑by‑block explanation of the CAPM implementation or explicitly demonstrate full ownership of AI-generated code (detailed function-level walkthrough and verification), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly identifies market-value weights, mapped the methodological steps, executed code that recalculates weights, and validated results—showing partial technical execution. However, under the strict standard they did not present block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit data sources/method for deriving market values, or detailed ownership of AI-generated code, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
