  "transcript": "All right. Hello everyone. My name is Levi Shrant and this is um assignment 9 for management 310. And today we have uh just a financial deep dive in calculating the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix in connection with uh their hypothetical $5 billion content investment decision. Um, so I guess what we're determining here is not the cheapest loan, but it's to find the perfect blend of of debt and equity uh that minimizes uh Netflix's overall uh financing costs. So this minimum cost is known as the weighted average cost of capital and it acts as our non-negotiable hurdle rate for for this investment. So basically the bottom line is if uh the $5 billion project can't generate a return higher than this um weighted average cost of capital uh it will destroy our shareholder value and we should reject it. So, we're going to use data to determine and test this new financing plan and provide uh Netflix a clear um a clear strategic recommendation. So, our analysis is structured around the driver framework. So, The define and discover uh stages are crucial because they set up the problem and define terms that we'll be using in the analysis. So for define uh we're using two uh core models which I've uh already mentioned but it's the cost of equity and the weighted average cost of capital formula. Um and then to discover uh we gathered all the inputs and respective numbers for the terms and we know the market cap is 200 billion, the equity beta is 1.3 and the risk-free rate is 4.5%. Uh for debt we know that the bond yield is 5.8% and the corporate tax is 21%. So the Python script handles the math and uh as you can see we have the the formulas for the cost of equity after tax cost of debt and these will just call the value and the ter assigned to these terms up here that are using the formulas down here. Um and so as we can see if we scroll down uh the cost of equity is 11.65%. So this is the return net Netflix must deliver to its highly volatile equity investors to to deem this project worthy and not diminish shareholder value. And then we also have the after tax cost of debt which is 4.58%. And so this is thanks ultimately thanks to the tax shield because the true cost of debt is 5.8%. So we had it drop to 4.58%. Um and so in scenario one, our current uh weighted average cost of capital is uh before any new financing, Netflix has a very equityheavy structure. Only about 6.1% of its value is debt. So our script calculates the current weighted average cost of capital at 11.22%. 22%. So this is our initial hurdle rate for the $5 billion content investment. Um so the weighted average cost of capital after debt insurance. Um so really the deal is here is that Netflix is considering issuing $3 billion in new debt. Um so the script the Python script incorporated this and increasing the total debt weight to uh 7.41%. down here. And by increasing this cheaper debt component, the weighted average cost of capital drops will drop slightly to 11 uh 13%. So this drop confirms that the initial benefit of the T debt tax shield outweighs any immediate rise in financial risk. So the investment is now marginally cheaper to finance. So in the verify phase, let's see if I can find it here. Maybe I just had it down. Okay. Uh yeah. So number three, peer and industry comparison. We um to verify we compared Netflix to some of its competitors. So we look at the chart. Netflix weighted average cost of capital is at about 11.22%. right here, that red dot, which is significantly higher than the industry range of 8 to 10%. And far above it Disney's 8.2%. Netflix high beta at 1.3 gives it high systematic risk and its conservative structure um underutilizes cheap debt. So the 11.12% of weighted average cost of capital is only suitable for an average risk content project. For the portion of the 5 billion investment going to international content which involves higher political and currency risks. We must use a higher country risk adjusted weight average cost of capital. So the firmwide rate is simply too low to adequately penalize a high-risk project ultimately. So the final step for this project is based off of this data and based off of our results, what is the recommend recommendation we're going to make uh towards Netflix. So in regards to the $5 billion investment, since the weighted average cost of capital is about 11%, Netflix must confidently project a return greater than that to justify the spending ultimately. And then the op optimal capital structure um the weighted average cost of capital after adding debt means Netflix is currently underleveraged. So we recommend they continue to increase their debt utilization beyond the plan 3 billion to capture more of the debt tax shield benefit. So to really summarize what I just said, this image um does a good job at encapsulating it. So as you can see, the blue line shows the weighted average cost of capital decreasing far away from the point where financial distress cost would cause the weighted average cost of capital to rise. So by adding more debt, Netflix can strategically lower its weighted average cost of capital uh making future con content investments in the entire company uh more valuable. That's all. Thank you.",
