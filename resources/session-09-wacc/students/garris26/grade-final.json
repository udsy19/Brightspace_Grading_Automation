You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its components: definition and CAPM linkage, numerical calculation of cost of equity and after-tax debt, scenario analysis (debt issuance), project-specific rates, sensitivity tests, and conceptual reflection on tax shields. The combination of correct computations, multiple applications, and reflective insight meets the rubric's requirements for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM (rf, beta, market risk premium) and reported the numerically consistent cost of equity (11.65%), implemented it in code, and explored sensitivity—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding that satisfies PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed an explicit after-tax cost of debt using provided yield and tax-rate inputs, applied it in WACC calculations (showing WACC change after debt issuance), and demonstrated conceptual understanding of the tax-shield mechanism plus sensitivity/optimization analyses. These concrete calculations plus reflective insight constitute a thorough treatment meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct-looking WACC outputs via Python and validated scenario results, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, detailed code-level understanding, or ownership (no block-by-block explanation or explicit run/verification statements), so the work meets PARTIAL but not PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used CAPM and produced a concrete cost-of-equity value (11.65%) via Python, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirements they did not explicitly show personal execution details, block-level code understanding, or explicit verification/ownership of the CAPM implementation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplied market-value figures and reported a computed debt weight (~6%), and used those weights in WACC scenarios, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT requirements they did not explicitly show running/verifying the code, nor provide a line-by-line explanation or ownership of the weight calculations, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
