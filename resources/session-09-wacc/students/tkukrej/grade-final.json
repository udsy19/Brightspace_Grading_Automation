  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and uses the WACC formula components (weights, Re, Rd, tax shield) and applies them to compute and compare pre/post-debt WACC values, demonstrating applied understanding. They further interpret implications (debt cheaper, equity risk rises) and benchmark against a peer, showing comprehensive, applied treatment consistent with a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the cost-of-capital problem, scope, and decision context and enumerates the specific analysis tasks and input data, satisfying explicit Discover & Define requirements. These explicit statements and input listing demonstrate a clear, actionable understanding suitable for downstream implementation and review.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly articulates the WACC formula and ties each capital-structure component (market equity, market debt, Re, Rd, tax shield) to its role in WACC, supplies the numeric inputs used, and demonstrates the effect of an added $3B debt on weights and WACC. This explicit mapping of components to outcome meets the Represent criterion at the required standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student supplied the CAPM inputs (beta, Rf, MRP) and used them in a coded WACC implementation, showing an applied understanding. However, they did not explicitly state or show the CAPM formula Re = Rf + beta*(MRP) nor report the computed cost-of-equity value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified RD and the corporate tax rate and explicitly included the (1–T) term in the WACC formulation and applied it in code, showing applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt. However, they did not explicitly compute or report the after-tax debt rate (RD*(1–T)) or quantify the tax-shield impact separately, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included the (1–T) tax-shield term and referenced tax benefits in their interpretation, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not explicitly compute or quantify the after-tax cost of debt or isolate the tax-shield's numerical impact, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",

        "\"What this formula basically is WCC equal to E upon V multiplied by E... Re is the cost of equity... Then the debt side will be D upon V... RD is the rate of the debt. 1 minus T is the corporate tax rate.\"",
        "\"After this stage, I'll be using this Python code that I u extracted from Gemini... with the help of this code I was able to calculate WCC currently for Netflix and Netflix post $3 billion debt.\"",
        "\"To conclude uh this analysis I would say a grow a controlled increase in debt improves Netflix cost of capital while preventing any financial risk and Netflix should move towards a moderate leverage structure not an aggressive one.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly frames the problem and required outputs; Implement — states use of Python code to compute WACC and reports numeric results; Reflect — interprets results and provides a policy recommendation (capital-structure guidance).",
      "reasoning": "The video presents the WACC concept, lists inputs, reports computed pre/post-debt results, and offers a reasoned recommendation, showing solid overall comprehension and communicative structure. However, the presentation omits detailed numeric breakdowns (e.g., explicit CAPM/Re, weight calculations), relies on external code without showing verification, and contains a minor units/logic slip (comparing a percentage to a dollar project), so it is competent but not fully thorough."
