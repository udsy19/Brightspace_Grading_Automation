  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed cost of equity (CAPM), after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights, and current/after-issuance WACC and provided sensitivity analysis and capital-structure implications. Their responses are thorough, show component-level understanding, and link calculations to decision-making, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated the after-tax cost of debt and applied it in the WACC, explicitly quantified the tax-shield benefit, and used sensitivity analysis to show how the tax shield interacts with changing debt costs—demonstrating both technical correctness and practical interpretation across DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly quantified the tax shield (after-tax Rd), incorporated it into WACC, and used sensitivity analysis to demonstrate how interest deductibility reduces effective cost of debt across leverage scenarios. They also connected this to actionable capital-structure guidance (target 20–25% debt), showing thorough understanding and application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs and produced a clear numeric Re used in WACC, showing sound conceptual understanding. However, treatment is basic: there is no sensitivity analysis of Re, no discussion of beta adjustments (levered vs. peer/unlevered) or project-specific equity-risk adjustments beyond a brief note, so the work is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The calculation is correct and all WACC components (Re, Rd after tax, weights, and numeric WACC) are presented and used in sensitivity analysis. However, under the STRICT technical rubric the student did not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, block-by-block explanation, or detailed ownership of the implementation—so the work is technically correct but lacks the explicit implementation evidence required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The CAPM formula and numeric result are correct and appropriately applied, demonstrating conceptual and computational correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard the student did not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, block-by-block explanation, or ownership of the implementation (they only state outputs exist in the notebook), so the work meets correctness but lacks the explicit implementation evidence required for a PASS.",

This combination of conceptual explanation, numerical interpretation, and practical recommendations meets the thoroughness required for PASS."
