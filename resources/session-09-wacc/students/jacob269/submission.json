  "transcript": "Uh, hello, my name is Andrew Jacobs, and this is the session on assignment. Uh, this is my analysis of Netflix's WACC for a hypothetical $5 billion dollar content investment. Uh, my overall goal is to calculate Netflix's current WACC, the WACC, after, uh, is showing $3 billion of new debt, uh, project specific WACC, uh, for US versus international content, a comparison to competitors like Disney and Amazon and then finally a recommendation for Netflix's optimal capital structure . Uh, the inputs I'm using are provided hypothetical values. Uh, Netflix has a $200 billion dollar equity value, uh, $13 billion of debt, beta of 1.3, a, uh, bond yield of 5.8%, a 21% tax rate, a 4.5% risk-free rate, and a market-risk premium of 5.5%. And, uh, before calculating anything, I'll load all of the assumptions, including the to Python. So in the first cell, I'm running cell one and to just to load all the core inputs. So this is equity, uh, debt, uh, tax rate, beta, risk-free rate, and the market-risk premium. Uh, so to represent the problem, I'm using the standard WA-CC formula, which is, uh, e divided by v times Re plus, uh, d divided by v times Re times 1 minus tax rate. So the The cost equity is calculated using the CAPM, which is RE equals RF plus beta times the and look at whispering. Now, the debt cost uses 5.8% yield, which is a adjusted for taxes. So for the project-specific discount rates, I apply a slightly lower beta for U.S. content and a higher beta for international content since international markets, uh, carry extra risk. Uh, next, I'll compute the cost of equity after tax, cost of debt, and, uh, this capital structure weights, and both versions of the WACC. So that's the current WACC and after you're shooting an extra $3 billion in debt. Alright now we have cell number two. It runs perfectly. Uh, this gives me a cost of equity, uh, after tax, cost of debt, and the current WACC and the ACC with the new debt. So, um, the cost of equity comes about, out to about 11.65%. The after tax cost of debt is at 4.58%. And using the market value weights, uh, Netflix's current WACC is is roughly 11.22%. Now, after adding the $3 billion in new debt, but it drops slightly too a bit. About 11.13% because debt is cheaper than equity. Alright, next. Uh, I'll now calculate two project specific discounts rates. So, that's one for the U.S. content and then one for the international content. So, in cell three, we calculate project specific, uh, WACC is using different betas for the U.S. versus debt and international content. So, after getting results, U.S. content has a slightly lower beta, and it is around 10.96% and the international content has a higher risk and a higher beta, giving it around, uh, 12.25%. So, finally, I will, uh, generate a WACC sensitivity visualization that shows how it changes as Netflix adjusts its leverage. Uh, so, um, we can see the results here in the graph. This creates a WACC versus debt graph and the vertical lines mark Netflix's current debt ratio and its ratio after issuing the, extra $3 billion in debt. So, uh, these results look consistent with Netflix's WACC is higher than the, uh, typical media industry range of 8 to 10%. It's also higher than Disney's at about 8.2% in Amazon Prime Video of 9.5%. And this all makes sense because Netflix has a higher beta and uses far less debt in its capital structure. So, based on the results, my recommendation is that Netflix can safely take on more debt, issuing the extra $3 billion to let it reduce the firms that we used to see and keeps the company within investment. Great risk. Uh, the long-term, uh, Netflix can move towards a 20 to 25% debt weight, which is still below Disney's leverage, but would meaningfully, meaningfully, uh, reduce the WACC. Uh, Netflix should also use different hurdle rates for content investments. So, about 11% for U.S. content and 12 to 12.5% uh, international content. And overall, this project helped me understand how capital structure decisions translate directly into discount rates for specifically real investment choices. And then, for the AI, you use AI to help me brainstorm, uh, outline the project and help rate code. And that is my session 9 assignment. Thank you for watching.",
