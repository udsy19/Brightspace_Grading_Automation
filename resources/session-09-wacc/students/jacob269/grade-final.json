  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the WACC formula and components, uses CAPM for equity and a tax-adjusted debt yield, supplies concrete inputs, computes numeric cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, and multiple WACC scenarios (including project-specific and post-debt issuance). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC; the minor wording slip in the spoken formula does not undermine the correct implementation and interpretation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states use of CAPM, supplies RF, beta, and market premium inputs, and computes RE = 11.65%, which matches 4.5% + 1.3*5.5%. They also apply adjusted betas for project-specific rates and interpret implications, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies a bond yield and the corporate tax rate to compute an after-tax cost of debt (5.8% -> 4.58%) and incorporates the (1–tax rate) adjustment in the WACC calculation, demonstrating correct application of the tax shield. They also interpret the effect of additional debt on WACC, showing applied understanding beyond a cursory mention.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compared their WACC results to an industry range and to peer-company WACCs (Disney, Amazon), demonstrating external-style validation. However, they did not cite specific external sources, tools, or references for those benchmark numbers, so validation is present but not fully documented — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The student correctly presents the primary trade-off—more debt lowers WACC and therefore can justify issuing $3B and moving toward 20–25% leverage—and links this to Netflix's beta and peer comparisons. However, treatment is brief and omits a thorough discussion of the countervailing costs (financial distress, changes to equity risk/payout flexibility, or quantitative stress tests), so the explanation is correct but not sufficiently deep for a full PASS.",

        "\"So, based on the results, my recommendation is that Netflix can safely take on more debt, issuing the extra $3 billion...

      "driver_alignment": "Discover (clearly stated the problem and objectives), Implement (walked through loading inputs and running analysis cells), Reflect/Evolve (interpreted results, compared peers, and gave concrete recommendations and hurdle rates).",
      "reasoning": "The video presents a coherent, structured narrative: clear goals, explicit methodological steps (inputs, CAPM, tax-adjusted debt), validated numeric outputs, and practical recommendations tied to the analysis. Minor verbal hesitations do not undermine the overall clarity and demonstrated understanding, so the presentation meets the criterion."
