  "transcript": "FULL VIDEO TRANSCRIPT — Netflix WACC Analysis (Simple + Professional) Hi everyone. In this video, I'm going to walk through my WACC analysis for Netflix using the DRIVER framework. The goal is to figure out Netflix's Weighted Average Cost of Capital and understand how it affects Netflix's investment decisions. ________________ D – Define & Discover The problem I'm analyzing is whether Netflix should move forward with a hypothetical five-billion-dollar content investment. To evaluate this, I need to calculate Netflix's WACC. WACC represents the minimum return the company needs to earn in order to satisfy both equity investors and debt holders. Here are the key numbers Netflix is working with: * Market cap: 200 billion dollars * Debt (market value): 13 billion * Equity beta: 1.3 * Bond yield: 5.8% * Tax rate: 21% * Risk-free rate: 4.5% * Market risk premium: 5.5% These inputs will feed directly into the WACC formula. ________________ R – Represent Next, I lay out the structure of the WACC calculation. WACC has three main parts: 1. The cost of equity, which I calculate using the CAPM formula. 2. The after-tax cost of debt, because interest payments are tax-deductible. 3. The weights, which come from market values of equity and debt. Laying this out ahead of time gives a clear picture of what I need before calculating anything. ________________ I – Implement Now I calculate each WACC component. 1. Cost of Equity CAPM = Risk-free rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium = 4.5% + 1.3 × 5.5% = 11.65% 2. After-Tax Cost of Debt After-tax cost = 5.8% × (1 – 0.21) = 4.58% 3. Capital Structure Weights Total capital = 200B equity + 13B debt = 213B * Equity weight ≈ 94% * Debt weight ≈ 6% 4. Final WACC WACC = 0.94 × 11.65% + 0.06 × 4.58% WACC ≈ 11.2% So Netflix's current WACC is about 11.2 percent. ________________ V – Validate To validate the results, I compare them to the industry. Disney's WACC is about 8.2%, and Amazon's is about 9.5%. Netflix's WACC is higher because its stock has more risk and the company relies more on equity financing. All of the numbers used—beta, debt yield, tax rate, market values—make sense and fit Netflix's risk profile. ________________ E – Evolve Now I think about how WACC changes. If Netflix issues an extra 3 billion dollars of debt, its debt weight increases. Debt is cheaper because of the tax shield, so this could lower WACC. But if Netflix takes on too much debt, its risk goes up, and beta increases, which can make WACC rise again. For project-specific cases: * U.S. content projects can use the regular WACC * International projects often require a higher discount rate because they carry more risk ________________ R – Reflect The biggest lesson here is that WACC is more than just a formula. It is the return Netflix needs to earn so investors stay satisfied. If Netflix takes on a project that earns more than 11.2%, it adds value. If a project earns less, it destroys value. WACC ties together risk, return, financing choices, and strategy. It helps Netflix decide which big investments actually make financial sense. ________________ Closing Statement (Simple & Added to Transcript) \"To close, Netflix's WACC is about 11.2%, which means any project they take on needs to earn more than that to create value. Netflix's WACC is higher than companies like Disney and Amazon because Netflix carries more risk and relies more on equity. Adding more debt could lower the WACC because of the tax benefit, but too much debt also increases risk. Overall, WACC helps Netflix decide which projects are worth investing in. Thank you for watching.\"",
