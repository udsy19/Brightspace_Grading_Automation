  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and explained the WACC components, applied CAPM for cost of equity, computed after-tax cost of debt and market-value weights, and produced a coherent numeric WACC with validation and implications. The treatment is detailed, applied to examples (industry comparison, leverage effects), and demonstrates a strong, thorough grasp of the WACC calculation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated the after-tax cost of debt using the bond yield and tax rate, explicitly explained why debt is entered after-tax, and discussed the tax-shield benefit and its impact on WACC (including leverage trade-offs). The treatment is accurate, applied numerically, and connected to practical implications, meeting the threshold for a thorough demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained that interest is tax-deductible, calculated the after-tax cost of debt, and applied the tax-shield concept to show how increasing debt could lower WACC (while noting trade-offs). The explanation is accurate, numerically applied, and connected to practical implications, meeting the threshold for a thorough demonstration.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the CAPM formula and used the result in the overall WACC, showing clear practical understanding (Implement/Represent). However the treatment is basic: they did not discuss beta sourcing/adjustment, CAPM assumptions, or sensitivity checks, so the coverage is correct but not sufficiently in-depth for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates an understanding of which inputs (debt weight, beta, project risk) influence WACC and discusses directional effects, but they did not perform explicit numerical sensitivity tests (no recalculated WACC under alternative inputs, no ranges or tables, and no executed code). That yields a correct but incomplete treatment, matching PARTIAL.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission shows manual, step-by-step arithmetic but contains no explicit evidence of automation (no code, spreadsheet, macros, APIs, or described automated workflow). Because the criterion requires demonstration of any automation of WACC calculations and none is shown, the student fails this criterion.",

        "\"The goal is to figure out Netflix's Weighted Average Cost of Capital and understand how it affects Netflix's investment decisions.\"",
        "\"WACC has three main parts: 1. The cost of equity, which I calculate using the CAPM formula. 2. The after-tax cost of debt, because interest payments are tax-deductible. 3. The weights, which come from market values of equity and debt.\"",
        "\"To close, Netflix's WACC is about 11.2%, which means any project they take on needs to earn more than that to create value.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly stated the objective and decision context; Represent — laid out the calculation framework and required components; Implement — walked through numeric calculations; Validate/Evolve/Reflect — compared to peers, discussed leverage effects and project-specific adjustments, and summarized implications.",
      "reasoning": "The video is well-structured and communicative: it states the decision problem, explains the methodology step-by-step, shows numeric results, validates against peers, and draws clear practical conclusions. This coherent presentation and demonstrated understanding meet the standard for an effective explanatory video."
