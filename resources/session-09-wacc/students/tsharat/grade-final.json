  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of WACC formula and components: explicit CAPM cost-of-equity, after-tax cost-of-debt, market-value weights, scenario recalculation, and advanced checks (Hamada unlever/relever, rating-linked yields, sensitivities). Depth, multiple applications, and validation steps meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct application of CAPM: clear specification of inputs, explicit cost-of-equity calculations, sensitivity analysis, and advanced peer unlever/relever work. These elements collectively show deep understanding and multiple applications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes the after-tax cost of debt, uses it in WACC calculations, and demonstrates the tax-shield effect with numerical scenarios and sensitivity/stress tests (including rating-driven yield changes). Multiple applications and validation steps show a thorough, correct treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies CAPM inputs and reports a clear numeric cost-of-equity result and uses it in sensitivity and peer analyses, demonstrating correct application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation or an unambiguous statement of personal execution/verification of the code, so the work shows correct implementation but lacks the required explicit technical ownership/detailing for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and uses market values (200B equity, 13B debt) and reports mathematically consistent weights, showing correct technical treatment. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not explicitly state personal execution or provide block-by-block code explanation/verification evidence, so the implementation is correct but lacks the explicit ownership/detail needed for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performs clear external cross-checks against peers (Disney, Amazon) and an industry WACC range and uses pure-play results to confirm consistency—demonstrating validation effort. However, they do not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Damodaran, published reports) or show where the peer benchmark numbers came from, so the validation is substantive but lacks the explicit source-level documentation required for a full PASS.",

        "\"Using CAPM with a beta of 1.3, a 4.5 percent risk free rate, and a 5.5 percent market risk premium, I get a cost of equity of 11.65 percent. The after tax cost of debt is the 5.8 percent bond yield times one minus the 21 percent tax rate, which gives 4.582 percent. Putting these into the WACC formula: Current WACC is 11.2186 percent.\""

      "reasoning": "The submission clearly explains each WACC component, states assumptions (market-value weights, risk-free choice), shows the CAPM implementation with inputs and numerical results, and validates choices via sensitivity and peer analyses.
