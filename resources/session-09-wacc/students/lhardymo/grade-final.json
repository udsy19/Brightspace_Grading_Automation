  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its components: they identify weights (market equity/debt), compute costs (cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt), provide numeric WACC results and comparative examples, and validate via scenarios and recalculation. The combination of implementation, validation, and reflection meets the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the after‑tax cost of debt and the tax‑shield mechanism, provides a numeric illustrative example (10M interest → 2.1M tax savings), and applies the concept when recalculating WACC for a $3B debt scenario and scenario analyses. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric example, and applied recalculation demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment deserving PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains interest deductibility and the tax‑shield mechanism, provides a numeric illustrative example (10M interest → 2.1M tax savings), and applies the concept when recalculating WACC for a $3B debt scenario and scenario analyses. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric example, and applied use meets the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses CAPM to produce a numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and applies it within WACC calculations and scenario analysis, demonstrating functional understanding. However, they do not show the CAPM inputs or derivation (risk-free rate, beta, market premium) or discuss how those inputs were chosen, so the treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student identifies all necessary WACC components, reports numeric results (costs and weights), and performed internal validation and scenario checks, demonstrating partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal code execution, block‑by‑block implementation details, or take explicit ownership of running/verifying code, so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must show personal execution and block‑by‑block implementation (inputs like risk‑free rate, beta, market premium, code or formula steps, and ownership). The transcript only reports a CAPM output (11.65%) without showing inputs, code, stepwise calculation, or explicit statement that they ran and verified the CAPM implementation themselves, so it fails the requirement.",

        "[\"I made three scenarios. One 80% equity, 20% debt. Um, the second one was 50/50 and the third one was mostly debt and less equity. Um, so you can see here the WACC for more equity is 10.2 then 8.12 and then 6%.\"]",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, logical trade‑off: debt lowers WACC via tax shields up to a point, beyond which increased default/risk raises WACC. They support this with visualization, multiple scenario outputs, and explicit reflection on implications, meeting the standards for a thorough presentation."
