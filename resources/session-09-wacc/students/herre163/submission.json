  "transcript": "Hello, my name is Jose Herrera. Today I am presenting a capital structure analyst for Netflix regarding a hypothetical 5 billion content investment. To ensure a rigorous approach, I am using the DRIVER framework. Define: The objective is to calculate this Netflix weighted average cost of capital to serve as a hurdle rate for new investments. Review: I have reviewed the hypothetical financial data, noting that Netflix currently has a market capitalization of 200 billion but only 13 billion in market value debt. So as you can see, we have market cap at 200 billion and debt, um, at 13 billion. Identify: I have identified the capital asset pricing model as the current total for equity and the after-tax yield method for debt. We will now determine the current WACC, analyze the impact of adding 3 billion in debt, and comparing this to competitors like Disney. Part 2: Identify and Execute. First, the cost of equity using the CAPM model. We take the risk-free rate of 4.5%—you can see risk-free rate 4.5%—and the product of Netflix beta 1.3 and the market risk premium 5.5%. So the market risk premium 5.5%. This result in a cost of equity of 11.65%. This is relatively high reflecting the volatility of a pure play streaming stock. Second, the cost of debt. Netflix pre-taxed cost of debt is 5.8%. Cost of debt 5.8 percent. You can see right here I noted that down. However, interest payments are tax deductible. Applying the 21% tax rate, the after-tax cost of debt represents only 4.58%. So as we plug that in... so you have uh 21 right here percent. And we plug that into Python and we after-tax cost of debt is 4.58% that's what we got. Then third, the WACC. We must use market values not book values for the weight. Equity value 200 billion, debt value 13 billion, total capital is 213 billion. So we basically calculated component cost, cost of equity like we just said, uh, then we calculate the current WACC total value equals market cap plus debt. And then um, how we model the scenario issuing 3 billion is a new debt. I'm adding this to the total capital pool to see how the interest leverage impacts the WACC. Calculate the WACC after 3 billion debt issue, the new debt issue is 3.0. Weighting these components results in a current WACC of 11.22%. This is our baseline hurdle rate. So as you can see Netflix current 11.22%. Netflix is considerably raising 3% [billion] in a new debt. When we model this scenario we add 3% [billion] to the debt pile because the cost of debt 4.58% is significantly cheaper than the cost of equity 11.65%. Adding debt lowers the average. My analysis shows this interest would lower the WACC slightly to 11.13%. As you can see this is the new with the the change, um, when we add the 3 billion to the debt pile. This demonstrates the tax shield effect. By utilizing debt the company lowers its overall cost of funding which increases the value of the firm provided they don't take on so much debt they risk bankruptcy. So look, um, so the visual, so the bar chart comparing Netflix, Disney and Amazon... you can see Disney is 8.2, Amazon 9.50, and the average is like 9%. This is all, we put this on visual peer comparison, so all these numbers we put in already and into the chart so we're able to see. Looking at the competitive landscape we see a major... Disney WACC is 8.2%, Netflix WACC is roughly 11.2%. Why is the difference? Disney utilizes the capital structure of 30% debt whereas Netflix is using roughly 6%. Disney has optimized its mix to lower its funding costs. This gives Disney a mathematical advantage when bidding for the same content projects. Projects specific note regarding the 5 billion investments: We should not use the 11.2% flat rate for everything. The US content should be discounted at the firm WACC at 11.2%. International content should carry a risk premium to account for currency and geopolitical fluctuations likely raising the hurdle rate to 13% or 14%. Again these are assumptions, small debt increase likely won't shift credit rating... to satisfy the valuation requirements I generated a bar chart. So this is just all like assumptions and pulling out some facts. To conclude here are my recommendations. Proceed with the debt insurance [issuance]. Raising the 3% [billion] is effective. It lower lowers the WACC to 11.13% as we can see when we... cost of equity 11.65%, after-tax cost is 4.58%, current WACC is 11.22. That's the new so so that's why the 3 billion is effective, it lowers lowers the WACC. Allows Netflix to fund content without diluting shareholders. Strategy shift. Netflix is currently under leveraged. To compete with Disney effectively Netflix should consider gradually increasing its debt rate over the long term to drive its WACC down toward the industry average of 9 and 10%. Investment decisions. If the project return on this 5 billion content package exceeds the 11.22% hurdle rate the project should be approved. Thank you.",
