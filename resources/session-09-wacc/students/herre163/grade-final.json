  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied WACC components (CAPM for Re, after-tax Rd, market-value weights) and produced consistent numeric results and a scenario analysis, demonstrating thorough understanding and appropriate reflection on implications. Evidence from the Implement and Reflect stages supports a comprehensive treatment, so this meets PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after‑tax cost of debt and applied it in WACC calculations and scenario analysis, and they explicitly discussed the tax‑shield benefit and its limits. The work demonstrates both correct mechanics and thoughtful reflection, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after‑tax cost of debt, explicitly linked interest deductibility to a lower effective debt cost, and applied this in a scenario showing its impact on WACC. They also reflected on the benefit and limits of the tax shield, providing both calculation and interpretation consistent with a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM and produced the right numeric cost of equity, demonstrating functional understanding (Implement). However, treatment is brief and lacks deeper justification of inputs (choice of risk‑free rate, beta source/adjustment, MRP) or sensitivity analysis, so it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student included all WACC components (Re via CAPM, after‑tax Rd, market-value weights) and produced correct numeric WACC results and scenario outputs, demonstrating correct technical computation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (no code blocks, no \"I ran and verified\" stepwise explanation or block-by-block walkthrough), so the submission is correct but falls short of full technical evidence required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM and reported the resulting cost of equity, demonstrating conceptual and numeric correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show personal execution details (no code, no \"I ran/verified\" or block‑by‑block explanation), so the technical implementation is incomplete.",
