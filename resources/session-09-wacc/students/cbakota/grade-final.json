  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC as the discount/hurdle rate, implements it in calculations and sensitivity tests, and interprets IRR vs. WACC for accept/reject decisions—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding with multiple examples. This meets the PASS standard for using WACC as a hurdle rate.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student implemented a systematic model (cash-flow table, MPV calculator) and executed structured sensitivity analysis including explicit WACC scenarios and visual outputs, then interpreted results—meeting the Implement-stage standard for a systematic calculation workflow with sensitivity testing. Although the transcript does not show WACC component derivation, the implementation and organized sensitivity methodology satisfy this moderate Implement criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly uses WACC as the hurdle/discount rate, evaluates project accept/reject via IRR vs WACC, runs WACC sensitivity, and links valuation outcomes to strategic option value—demonstrating clear recognition of WACC applications in capital budgeting and valuation.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses WACC as the discount rate and conducts sensible sensitivity analysis showing impact of WACC changes, demonstrating applied understanding. However, they do not explain the WACC formula or its components (costs of debt/equity, weights, tax shield), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student uses a WACC value and runs sensitivity analysis, but there is no discussion or calculation of the cost of equity via CAPM (no beta, risk-free rate, or market risk premium mentioned). Because the CAPM-based cost-of-equity calculation is missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission applies a corporate tax rate to salvage proceeds and uses a WACC, but it contains no calculation or discussion of pre- and after-tax cost of debt, interest expense, debt weight, or the tax shield benefit. Because the specific cost-of-debt and its after-tax treatment are missing, the criterion is not demonstrated.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Clearly frames the problem and analysis goals (MPV/IRR for the Starbucks project).\n- Represent/Implement: Walks through model structure, assumptions, code outputs and visualizations (base case and sensitivity scenarios).\n- Validate/Reflect/Evolve: Interprets results, runs and explains sensitivity tests, and provides a reasoned recommendation plus strategic considerations.",
      "reasoning": "The presenter clearly walks an audience through objectives, inputs, model outputs (NPV/IRR/payback), and sensitivity analysis, and draws a supported recommendation—showing comprehensive understanding and effective communication. Delivery is informal with filler words, but substance, use of visuals/printed outputs, and a coherent conclusion meet the PASS standard."
