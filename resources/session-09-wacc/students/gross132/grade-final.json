You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a thorough, accurate grasp of the WACC formula and components (use of market values, CAPM for equity, after-tax debt treatment), includes concrete numeric calculations (11.22% WACC), and applies the method in scenarios and comparisons. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect/Validate) demonstrate both technical execution and interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the CAPM formula, produced correct numeric results, and demonstrated how cost of equity responds to leverage changes, supported by code execution and sensitivity analysis. This is a thorough, applied treatment consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the after-tax cost-of-debt formula (pre-tax rate × (1–tax rate)), produced the numerical after-tax result via implementation, and explicitly discussed the tax-shield benefit and its impact on WACC and capital-structure decisions. The combination of formula, computation, and interpretation meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external-style validation by comparing computed WACC to peer companies and an industry range and used those comparisons to interpret results. However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, company filings, databases), so validation is substantive but lacks the explicit source attribution required for a full PASS.",
