However, under the STRICT Technical Implementation requirement, they do not demonstrate explicit personal execution or block‑by‑block technical implementation (no code/run verification or detailed methodological flowchart), so full credit is not warranted.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM conceptually and shows the numeric arithmetic for cost of equity, demonstrating understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not present explicit personal execution (no code, no \"I ran/verified\" statements, no block‑by‑block implementation), so full credit is not warranted.\n- Technical Implementation: The student conducts a few concrete sensitivity checks (pre/post $3B debt issuance, a 200bps international premium, and hypothetical leverage targets with estimated bps effects), showing conceptual and numeric understanding. However, they did not provide a systematic sensitivity table, multi-variable sweeps, code/run verification, or explicit methodological documentation required under the STRICT technical standard, so the work is only partially sufficient.",

        "\"So first would be to gradually increase leverage and it only has about 6% of debt in its current capital structure. And based on the WACC movement, raising debt to 15 to 20% would reduce the WACC by 50 to 100 BTS without harming the credit rating.\"",
        "\"if you take those values and plug them into the weighted average cost of capital equation, your new post issuance um WACCC is going to be 11.12. The additional debt slightly lowers it, but not by very much, about a 0.1% difference.\""

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the trade‑offs: identifies current under‑leverage, quantitatively shows the modest WACC reduction from additional debt, and recommends a specific leverage range (15–20%) with estimated bps benefits while noting credit risk—a logical, evidence‑based treatment satisfying the criterion."

        "\"So overall summary is that Netflix's current weighted average cost of capital is about 11.21 21 and adding 3 billion of debt should slightly lower it to 11.12 ... the optimal strategy is to gradually increase leverage, use dis differentiated discount rates, leverage data technology for capital allocation and then continuously refine the cost of capital model.\""
