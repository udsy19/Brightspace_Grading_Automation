  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission clearly explains WACC components (market-value weights, CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, tax shield) and provides computed example values and scenario analysis. Driver stages show structured modeling, implementation, and reflection, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt concept, specifies a corporate tax rate (21%), reports a concrete after-tax debt cost (4.58%), and demonstrates via scenario analysis that adding debt lowers WACC due to the tax shield. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric example, implementation, and interpretation meets the standards for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains interest deductibility as a government subsidy, specifies a tax rate (21%), uses after-tax cost-of-debt in calculations (4.58%), and demonstrates via scenario analysis that adding debt lowers WACC—showing both conceptual understanding and applied evidence of the tax shield effect. This combination meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies CAPM conceptually, provides a beta and a computed cost of equity, and implements the calculation. However, key CAPM inputs (risk-free rate and market risk premium) and the calculation steps are not shown or justified, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: This is a STRICT technical criterion requiring explicit demonstration of personal execution and block-level understanding. The student reports running a Python script (with AI help) and gives results, but does not show the code, the exact inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, explicit debt/equity weights), nor explain how each component was computed or verified. Therefore the submission fails the required explicit technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard, the student must explicitly show personal execution and block-by-block implementation of CAPM inputs and calculation. While CAPM and a beta are cited and a result is reported, the transcript provides no code, no explicit risk-free rate or market premium, no calculation steps, and no demonstration of ownership/verification—so it fails the required explicit technical demonstration.",
