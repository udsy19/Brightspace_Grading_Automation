  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies CAPM for cost of equity, computes after-tax cost of debt and market-value weights, models levering effects on beta, and interprets the WACC change—showing a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and calculation. Minor numeric inconsistency in the tax rate used (20% stated vs. 21% applied) does not materially undermine the demonstrated mastery.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, plugs in provided inputs to compute cost of equity, and demonstrates application by showing how changes in beta (from leverage) alter the equity cost—evidence of thorough, applied understanding. These steps across Discover, Implement, and Reflect satisfy the criterion for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax debt formula (debt yield * (1 − tax rate)), computes a numeric after-tax cost and uses it in WACC, and explicitly interprets the tax-shield benefit lowering WACC—demonstrating applied, thorough understanding. A minor numeric inconsistency in the tax rate used (20% stated vs. 21% applied) does not undermine the correct conceptual treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission shows computed WACC components and applied results (implementation and validation), but it lacks the strict explicit technical evidence required: no clear ownership statement of running/verifying code, no block‑by‑block explanation of the implementation or explicit display of weights/formulas and code output. Therefore it demonstrates partial technical implementation but falls short of the full, explicit demonstration required for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula and reports numeric results and impacts of levering—evidence of correct implementation conceptually. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide explicit technical evidence (no code snippets, block‑by‑block explanation, or clear statement of personal execution/verification), so the implementation is correct but not demonstrated with the required technical explicitness.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student provides market values and reports WACC/weights, they do not explicitly show the market‑value weight calculation, code, or a block‑by‑block explanation nor state personal execution/verification. Under the STRICT technical standard, that lack of explicit demonstration fails the requirement.",
