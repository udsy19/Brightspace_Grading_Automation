  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a correct definition, the explicit WACC formula and components (E, D, R_e, pre-tax debt, T), uses market-value weights and after-tax debt rationale, and provides numerical examples plus an implementation plan — demonstrating thorough, applied understanding. A minor slip in a quick-check phrasing (misstating WACC as \"the interest rate on the company's debt\") appears isolated and does not undermine the overall comprehensive treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states that interest is tax-deductible, includes the WACC formula components showing pre-tax debt and the tax rate, and supplies numeric inputs (6% debt, 25% tax) and rationale (tax shield reduces effective debt cost). This demonstrates a correct and reasonably thorough conceptual and applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield benefit.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states interest deductibility as the reason for using after-tax cost of debt, includes the WACC formula showing pre-tax debt and the tax rate, and provides numeric inputs (6% debt, 25% tax) plus practical implications. This demonstrates a correct, applied, and sufficiently thorough understanding of the tax-shield effect.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM as the method for cost of equity and provides relevant inputs (risk-free rate, market return, beta), showing conceptual understanding and intent to implement. However, they do not explicitly present the CAPM formula or demonstrate a worked calculation of cost of equity, so the treatment is correct but incomplete—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student states the full WACC formula and plans to code it, there is no explicit demonstration of running code, no block-by-block explanation, and no ownership/verification of outputs; reliance on AI prompts is indicated. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and justification, the submission fails to meet the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly names CAPM and outlines intent to implement, but provides no explicit CAPM formula application, no worked numeric calculation of cost of equity, no executed code or block-by-block explanation, and relies on AI prompts. Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit execution and ownership, this criterion is not met.",
