  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct grasp of WACC components and calculation: explicit inputs, use of market-value weights, CAPM for equity, after-tax debt treatment, and Hamada for levering/relevering beta, plus sensitivity analysis. These concrete elements and the DRIVER-stage progression meet the PASS standard for depth and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and implements the CAPM formula, supplies concrete inputs (rf, MRP, beta), and applies it across scenarios (current, relevered post-debt, project-specific betas, sensitivity analysis). This multiple-application, concrete treatment demonstrates a thorough and correct understanding of calculating cost of equity via CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements after-tax cost of debt (pre-tax × (1 − tax rate)), uses it in WACC calculations with updated capital structure after new debt issuance, and interprets the tax-shield impact across scenarios. Multiple applied examples (current vs post-issuance and sensitivity) demonstrate thorough, correct understanding of cost-of-debt and the tax benefit.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission shows correct, block-level understanding of WACC components and functions and applies them to scenarios, satisfying part of the strict technical requirement. However, the student does not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, step-by-step verification, or formal validation (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified outputs\" or detailed block-by-block traces), so it falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies and applies the CAPM formula with concrete inputs across scenarios, showing conceptual and implementation-level understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block verification, or an explicit \"I ran and verified\" statement, so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rather than a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly chooses and justifies market-value weights and describes computing and displaying the resulting weights, meeting the methodological requirement in concept. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block verification, or explicit validation (\"I ran and verified...\"), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — identified the capital-structure inputs and decision context.  \nImplement — built and applied a sensitivity model (relevering beta, recomputing cost of equity, recalculating WACC).  \nEvolve/Reflect — interpreted trade-offs (tax shield vs equity risk), used scenarios (post-issuance and debt-weight sweep), and gave a concrete recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, logical account of capital-structure trade-offs: implemented a sensitivity sweep, explains the mechanics (Hamada/relevering) and interprets results showing the tax-shield benefit at moderate leverage versus rising equity costs at high leverage. Multiple applied examples (post-issuance scenario, 0–60% debt sweep) and an explicit financing recommendation demonstrate thorough, well-structured reasoning consistent with PASS."
