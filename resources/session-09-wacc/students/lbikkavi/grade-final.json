You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and calculation—explicitly using CAPM for Ke, after-tax Kd, market-value weights, and producing concrete WACC results and scenario analyses (current, post-debt, international). DRIVER stages (Discover → Implement → Validate → Explain) provide clear evidence of depth, multiple examples, and appropriate interpretation, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM, set and documented inputs, computed a correct numeric Ke (4.5 + 1.3*5.5 = 11.65%), and applied it to WACC and project-specific analyses. DRIVER stages (Refine → Implement → Validate/Explain) show both correct calculation and thoughtful application, meeting the thoroughness for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used the after‑tax formula (kd*(1−t)), produced a numeric after‑tax cost of debt (4.58%), applied it in WACC scenario analyses, and explained the tax‑shield benefit and tradeoffs (credit‑rating risk). This is a thorough, correctly applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compared computed WACC to peer company values and an industry range, using those comparisons as sanity checks and to interpret results. However, they did not cite or name external data sources/tools used to obtain the peer figures, so external validation is present but not documented to the standard required for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents both sides of the capital‑structure tradeoff—quantifying the tax‑shield benefit (lower WACC under more debt) and acknowledging the countervailing cost (higher kd/credit‑downgrade risk at excessive leverage). They back the discussion with scenario numbers and a concrete, risk‑aware recommendation, satisfying the criterion for a logical, well‑balanced presentation."

These elements demonstrate an effective video presentation that conveys both technical execution and conceptual understanding."
