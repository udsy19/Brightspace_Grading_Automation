  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, and capital weights), provides numeric calculations and code output, and reflects on implications for capital structure and project-specific rates. Coverage includes both computation and application, demonstrating a thorough conceptual and practical grasp consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculates company WACC and distinct project WACCs (US and international) and explicitly recommends using lower/higher WACC as hurdle rates and matching funding types. Multiple numeric examples and a clear application to investment decision‑making demonstrate a thorough, practical understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the cost‑of‑capital problem (high WACC due to ~94% equity), quantifies current and alternative outcomes (current WACC, WACC after additional debt, target leverage effects), and proposes a clear financing decision and rationale. These explicit statements and numeric examples satisfy the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and reports a CAPM-based cost of equity (11.65%) and interprets beta’s meaning, showing implementation via code. However, they do not show the CAPM formula or the specific inputs (risk-free rate, market premium) or any sensitivity checks, so the treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and uses an after‑tax cost of debt (4.58%) and integrates it into the WACC calculation, showing implementation and interpretation. However, they do not show the tax rate or explicit tax‑shield calculation/explanation, so the treatment is accurate but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies an after‑tax cost of debt and integrates it into the WACC calculation, showing practical use of the tax benefit. However, they do not show the tax rate, the explicit tax‑shield formula, or quantify how interest deductibility produces the reduction, so the treatment is accurate but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Identified the core trade-off (high equity share raising WACC and opportunity to use debt).\n- Represent: Proposed a concrete framework (target leverage range, project‑specific funding/hurdles).\n- Implement/Reflect: Quantified effects (WACC today vs. post‑issuance, 50–120 bps benefit) and recommended risk‑management measures (maintain investment grade, hedging).",
      "reasoning": "The student explains both sides of the capital‑structure tradeoff—highlighting cheaper debt, the firm's current under‑leverage, quantified WACC benefits from added debt, and safeguards (investment‑grade target, hedging, project‑specific funding). These specific recommendations, numeric examples, and risk mitigations show a coherent, logical presentation of trade‑offs sufficient for a PASS."
