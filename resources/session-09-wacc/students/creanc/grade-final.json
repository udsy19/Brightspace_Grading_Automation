  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the WACC and CAPM formulas, computed cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights, and produced numeric current and post‑issuance WACCs with code validation. They extended the analysis with comparisons, tax‑shield reasoning, and a sensitivity/optimal leverage simulation, demonstrating thorough and well‑supported understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM formula, substituted explicit inputs (4.5% RF, beta 1.3, 5.5% MRP), produced the correct numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and validated it with code. This demonstrates a thorough and applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed Rd*(1–t) (5.8%×(1−0.21)=4.58%), applied it in the WACC formula, validated results with code, and explicitly linked the WACC reduction to the tax shield. They also discussed implications for leverage and ran sensitivity/optimization, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct component calculations and numeric WACCs and validated them with Python output, showing correct technical results. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not demonstrate explicit personal execution details or block‑by‑block explanation of the code (they relied on AI to generate code and offered no walkthrough of functions/logic), so the work meets correctness but lacks the required explicit implementation ownership and technical explanation for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM and produced the right numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and validated results with Python, showing correct conceptual and numerical implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution details (e.g., \"I ran the code\"), provide a block‑by‑block explanation of the implementation, or show ownership of the code internals—so the work is correct but lacks the required explicit technical exposition for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly computed market‑value weights (E/V and D/V) and applied them in WACC calculations, and they report validating those outputs with Python. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran the code\"), provide a block‑by‑block walkthrough of the implementation, or show clear ownership of the code internals—so correctness is evident but explicit technical ownership/documentation is incomplete.",
