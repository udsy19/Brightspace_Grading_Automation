  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components (equity cost via CAPM, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights), implemented calculations and sensitivity analyses, and reflected on implications and limits. Minor verbal/formula slip(s) appear in narration, but the overall depth, computations, and validation support a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium), produced a consistent numeric cost of equity (11.65% from 4.5% + 1.3×5.5%), and used it appropriately in WACC and project adjustments. They also validated the result conceptually and applied sensible project-specific adjustments, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and implemented the after‑tax cost of debt formula (pretax bond yield × (1−tax rate)), produced a specific numeric after‑tax KD (4.58%), used it in WACC computations and sensitivity tests, and reflected on the tax‑shield benefit and model limitations—meeting the standards for a thorough, applied treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed correct numeric WACC components and reported validation and results (consistent weights, Ke, Kd_after and overall WACC), showing practical implementation. However the submission lacks explicit, block‑by‑block explanation of the code/functions and an explicit \"I ran this code and verified...\" ownership statement; there is also a minor verbal/formula slip in the narrated formula. These gaps require PARTIAL rather than PASS under the strict technical implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented CAPM, produced a plausible numeric cost of equity (11.65% using stated inputs) and included validation checks, demonstrating correct application. However, they did not explicitly show personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code\"), provide block‑by‑block code explanations, or assert ownership of the run/verification, so the submission meets PARTIAL under the strict technical standards.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market equity and debt inputs and produced explicit numeric market‑value weights (93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) applied in WACC, showing correct methodology. However, under the strict technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code\"), provide block‑by‑block code explanation, or assert ownership of verification—so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the financing decision and need to evaluate leverage effects; Implement — built models and computed baseline and post‑debt WACCs; Validate/Reflect — ran sensitivity analysis and interpreted the trade‑off between tax benefits (lower WACC) and rising financial risk (higher costs beyond a point).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the capital‑structure trade‑off: identifies tax‑shield benefits, demonstrates it quantitatively (WACC before/after $3B debt and a leverage sweep), and explains the countervailing increase in financial risk and costs. The combination of numeric examples, sensitivity analysis, and reflective discussion meets the standard for a thorough, logical presentation."
