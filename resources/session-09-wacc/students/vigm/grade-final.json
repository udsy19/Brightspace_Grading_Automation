You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined the WACC components (CAPM equity, after-tax debt, market weights), performed appropriate calculations and applied the concept to a debt-issuance scenario and peer comparison, demonstrating thorough understanding and practical application. Minor numeric wording inconsistencies do not undermine the clear, comprehensive treatment required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly specified CAPM inputs, explained the linkage of beta to market return, and computed the cost of equity (11.65%) applying it in the WACC model. The clear definition plus implemented numeric calculation and use in subsequent analysis demonstrate a thorough, correct treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly specified a pre-tax debt yield and corporate tax rate, computed the after-tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−0.21)=4.58%), and applied it in WACC calculations and scenario analysis, explicitly noting the tax-shield benefit. The combination of correct formula use, numeric execution, and applied implications supports a thorough treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified and combined WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and reported numeric results, demonstrating technical knowledge. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal code execution, block-level explanation, or ownership (they report using Collab/Gemini without \"I ran/verified\" or showing code), so the submission is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specified CAPM inputs and computed the cost of equity (11.65%), showing conceptual and numerical understanding. Under the STRICT technical standard, they failed to explicitly demonstrate personal execution/verification or provide block-by-block explanation of code (relying on Collab/Gemini), so the submission is correct but incomplete for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market-value inputs and produced numeric capital-weight outcomes, showing conceptual correctness.

        "\"Hi, my name is Meher and today I will be presenting a weighted average cost of capital analysis for Netflix focusing on the financial implications of their proposed $5 billion content investment.\"",
        "\"So first the cost of equity is calculated by 4.5% plus 1.3 * 5.5% yielding 11.65% ... And the calculation is done by 5.8% * 1 - 0.21 ... the after cost debt ... is much lower at 4.58%.\"",
        "\"So more importantly for the $5 billion content decision we must use project specific WACCs ... the firmwide 11.19% is too low for the high-risk international content and potentially too high for predictable US content.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly stated objective and context; Implement — walked through methodology and numeric calculations; Validate/Evolve — performed peer benchmarking and a debt‑issuance scenario; Reflect — offered concrete recommendations and strategic implications.",
      "reasoning": "The presentation is organized, follows the DRIVER structure, and communicates both methodology (CAPM, after‑tax debt, market weights) and application (scenario analysis, peer comparison, project‑specific recommendations). Despite minor verbal hesitations, the student conveys clear understanding and actionable conclusions, meeting PASS standards."
