  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly cited the WACC and CAPM formulas, produced numeric WACC estimates (current and after additional debt) using code, and explained why WACC changed (tax shield) plus did sensitivity and peer comparisons. This shows a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and their implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly referenced the CAPM formula, produced the correct numerical cost-of-equity (4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%) via implemented code, and used it in further analysis (WACC and sensitivity to beta/rates). This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided the necessary debt inputs and tax rate, implemented calculations via code, reported WACC before/after the new debt, and explicitly attributed the WACC reduction to the tax shield, demonstrating both conceptual and applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its benefit. This meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented a coded solution (Gemini output), checked variable mappings, and validated that results behaved as expected (WACC decreased with debt). However, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran the code\"), provide block-by-block explanation of the implementation, or fully own the code output—requirements of this STRICT technical criterion—so the submission earns PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually and produced the right numeric cost-of-equity, and they used code to implement it. However, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran the code\"), provide block-by-block explanations, or fully own the implementation details—requirements for this STRICT technical criterion—so the submission is partially satisfactory.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplied correct market-value inputs and used code (with variable checking) to produce weights implicitly, and they validated results qualitatively. However, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran the code\"), provide block-by-block explanations of how weights were computed, or fully own the implementation—so the technical strictness is only partially satisfied.",
