  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied WACC components (risk-free rate, market premium, beta → CAPM cost of equity), computed after-tax cost of debt, and calculated weights from capital structure, producing numeric results that match the inputs. They also ran scenario and sensitivity analyses and performed sanity checks, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding sufficient for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided correct CAPM inputs and implemented a CAPM function that yields the correct numeric cost of equity (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%), then applied it in scenario and sensitivity analyses. Their use of the function, checks, and application to project-specific hurdles shows a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM appropriate for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student implemented an after-tax cost-of-debt calculation, reported a concrete after-tax rate (4.54%), and explicitly tied lower WACC to the interest tax shield in validation and sensitivity analyses. These elements show a correct and applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its tax-shield benefit, meeting the threshold for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly implemented functions, ran the code, produced numeric cost components and WACCs, and performed validation—showing practical execution. However, they did not provide the strict, block-by-block explanation or explicit ownership/verification statements required by this category (e.g., detailed walkthrough of each function and explicit \"I ran and verified\" commentary), so the technical implementation is correct but not fully explicitly demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented a CAPM function, ran the model to produce a specific cost-of-equity (11.65%) and performed sanity checks, demonstrating practical execution. However, they did not provide the strict, block-by-block explanation or explicit ownership/verifications (e.g., \"I ran and inspected this function which does X\") required by this strict category, so the implementation is correct but not fully explicitly demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplied numeric equity and debt figures, stored them in code, and reported the computed weight (~93% equity), demonstrating practical calculation of weights. However, they did not explicitly state that weights were computed from market values versus book values, nor provide a block-by-block walkthrough or explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership required by this strict category, so the implementation is only partially demonstrated.",
