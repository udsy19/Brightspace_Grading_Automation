  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the WACC formula components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, and weighted blend), computes numeric values, and applies them to compare pre/post-debt and peers. The work is comprehensive—includes inputs, calculations, sensitivity/graphs, and managerial implications—meeting the threshold for a thorough demonstration.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, applies it with given inputs to produce an accurate numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and uses that result in analysis and interpretation. Combined DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT evidence shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the tax adjustment rationale, computes and reports the after-tax cost of debt (4.58%), and demonstrates its effect on WACC with pre/post-debt scenarios and a recommendation that weighs tax-shield benefits against credit risk. Combined DISCOVER, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT evidence shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes the correct WACC components and reports plausible numeric results (cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, WACC) and used code to compute scenarios. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code understanding, or verification of outputs—so the calculation appears correct but lacks the required explicit technical ownership.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies CAPM (Rf + beta*MRP) and reports the correct numeric cost of equity, demonstrating conceptual and computational accuracy. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution, block-level code explanation, or verification of outputs, so the submission meets a partial (not full) technical implementation requirement.\n- Technical Implementation: The student uses and reports market-value figures and indicates code was used to compute weights and WACC and validated results with plots, demonstrating correct conceptual and computational steps. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution, block-by-block code explanation, or verification steps (e.g., \"I ran X cell; this function computes Y\"), so technical ownership is incomplete — warranting PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents capital-structure trade-offs with concrete numbers (pre/post-debt WACC), sensitivity analysis, and a specific recommendation (15–20% target debt) that balances tax benefits and credit/risk considerations. The argument is logical, supported by analysis and visualization, meeting the PASS standard."
