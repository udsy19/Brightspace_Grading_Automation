  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, technically correct treatment of WACC and its components (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, and Hamada beta adjustment), with numerical application and sensitivity analysis. Combined with explicit DRIVER-stage implementation and validation, this meets the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM, justifies parameter choices, computes r_e with numeric detail (11.65%), and demonstrates adjustments for leverage (Hamada) plus sensitivity testing. The depth, numeric examples, and DRIVER-stage evidence meet the standards for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly derives and numerically applies the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% → 4.58%), explains the tax-shield intuition with a concrete $100 example, and incorporates the tax-shield effects into WACC, leverage scenarios, and value-impact calculations. Combined DRIVER-stage evidence and sensitivity/peer analysis demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding, meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states the WACC formula, shows component values, and computes the numeric result — demonstrating technical correctness. However, under the STRICT implementation standard they did not provide explicit code, block‑by‑block explanations, or evidence of personally running and verifying the implementation, so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies CAPM with numeric inputs and sensitivity testing, demonstrating conceptual and numerical mastery of the model. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code, block‑by‑block explanation, or direct evidence of personally running and verifying the CAPM implementation, so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly chose and used market values, computed E/V and D/V correctly, and integrated these into the WACC—demonstrating conceptual and numerical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit implementation evidence (no code, no “I ran this” or block‑by‑block explanations), so the criterion is only partially satisfied.",
