You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the WACC components (CAPM for Re, Rd·(1–T) for after-tax debt, and market-value weights) with numeric calculations and a resulting WACC, then interpreted and compared results to peers and discussed leverage effects. This is a thorough, conceptually complete treatment meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied the CAPM formula, supplied the inputs, and produced a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), then integrated that result into broader analysis and recommendations. Coverage is specific, numerically justified, and interpreted—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the after‑tax debt formula (Rd·(1–T)) with numeric inputs and used the result in WACC calculations. They explicitly discussed the tax‑shield benefit, compared capital structures, and recommended actionable changes with quantified effects, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The calculation components and numeric WACC output are present and conceptually correct, showing partial technical correctness. Because this is a STRICT technical category, the student needed to explicitly demonstrate ownership (e.g., \"I ran the code,\" show code or stepwise calculations, or explain block‑by‑block verification). Reliance on AI outputs without explicit personal execution/verification prevents a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM with explicit inputs and produced the correct numeric cost of equity, showing conceptual and procedural understanding. Because this is a STRICT technical criterion, the absence of explicit personal execution or block‑by‑block implementation/verification (the student cites Google Gemini rather than showing their own run or ownership) prevents a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described and numerically applied the market‑value weighting method and produced plausible weights, showing conceptual and procedural understanding. Because this is a STRICT technical criterion, the lack of explicit personal execution, code/run evidence, or block‑by‑block ownership (the student cites Google Gemini/Colab) prevents a full PASS, yielding PARTIAL.",

        "\"essentially we are calculating the cost of capital or the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix... our objective is to calculate this weighted average cost... and then use this to evaluate the investment decision of $5 billion\"",
        "\"To find this the first step will be to calculate the current cost of equity using the CAPM formula ... 4.5% plus that beta times the um MRP ... and that gives us 11.65%.\"",
        "\"Google Collab has created a bar chart analyzing these companies with the amount of cost.\" / \"Netflix really should execute the $3 billion debt issuance... A more optimal structure would likely be 80% equity and 20% debt\""

      "driver_alignment": "DISCOVER — framed the problem and decision context clearly; IMPLEMENT — walked through stepwise methodology and numeric calculations (CAPM, after‑tax debt, weights, WACC); REFLECT — used visuals and results to interpret and recommend a financing strategy.",
      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, logical flow (objective → inputs → method → numeric results → scenarios → recommendation), includes concrete numbers and a visualization, and ties analysis to strategic recommendations. Delivery contains some informal speech but communicates understanding effectively, meeting the criterion for an effective presentation."
