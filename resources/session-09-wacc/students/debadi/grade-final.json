  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explicitly derives WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), shows numeric calculations and sensitivities, and applies a project-specific adjustment—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS standards. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) provide clear evidence of problem framing, execution, and interpretation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly implemented CAPM, produced the correct numeric cost-of-equity (11.65% consistent with the stated inputs), and applied a sensible project-specific adjustment (country premium) with interpretation. The combination of coding implementation, numeric results, and applied sensitivity demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed an after-tax cost of debt (4.6%), used market-value weights in the WACC calculation, and demonstrated understanding of the tax-shield effect via leverage sensitivity analysis. Implementation and interpretation across the DRIVER stages show a thorough, applied treatment consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported WACC components and ran sensitivities, showing functional implementation and validation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide the required explicit block-by-block code walkthrough or explicit ownership/verification language (e.g., detailed function descriptions or \"I ran and verified this block\"), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported a concrete CAPM-based cost of equity (11.65%) using stated inputs, showing implementation and validation steps, but did not provide the required strict-level explicit block-by-block code walkthrough, explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership, or detailed function-level explanations—so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rating.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market-value inputs (market cap, debt) and reported computed equity/debt weights, showing the calculation was performed and validated. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide a block-by-block code walkthrough or explicit ownership/verification language (e.g., detailed function-level explanation or \"I ran and verified this block\"), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explained the trade-off (tax benefits vs higher distress risk), demonstrated it with numeric scenario analysis showing minimal WACC impact from modest debt, and drew practical recommendations (moderate leverage acceptable; avoid large increases). This combination of conceptual clarity, example, and implication satisfies a thorough presentation of capital-structure trade-offs."
