  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, specific understanding of WACC components and calculation: explicit CAPM use for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, capital weights, and Hamada unlever/relever adjustments, plus scenario and sensitivity analysis. Multiple DRIVER stages (Discover, Represent, Implement, Verify, Evaluate) show both correct methodology and comprehensive application, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies and uses CAPM inputs, implemented a cost‑of‑equity function, adjusted beta with Hamada and recalculated cost of equity for scenarios, and ran sensitivity checks—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that satisfies PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified a pre‑tax debt yield (5.8%), applied the corporate tax rate (21%) to compute after‑tax cost of debt, implemented this in code, and demonstrated the tax‑shield effect lowered WACC in the scenario analysis. Multiple DRIVER stages show both correct conceptual understanding and applied computation, satisfying PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented CAPM in code, adjusted beta with Hamada, and ran/verified results—showing correct practical application. However, they did not provide the required strict, block‑by‑block explanation of the CAPM function or an explicit step‑by‑step account of running and verifying the code (they also note AI assistance), so the technical implementation is correct but lacks the explicit, detailed ownership required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market values ($200B equity, $13B debt) and states they calculated debt/equity weights and produced a results table, showing practical application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough or an explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership narrative—so implementation is correct but lacks the detailed, explicit demonstration required for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compared WACC results to industry benchmarks and peer figures and produced peer comparison outputs, showing external-style validation. However, they did not cite specific external sources/tools (websites, databases, calculators) used to obtain or confirm those peer/benchmark numbers, so this meets PARTIAL per the rubric.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains the capital‑structure trade‑off—tax shield benefits versus higher equity cost from increased beta—implements scenario and sensitivity analyses, and draws an explicit threshold conclusion (~$30–40B) where WACC turns adverse. These elements collectively demonstrate a logical, well‑supported presentation of trade‑offs."

The presenter explains not just computations but implications for financing decisions and shows supporting visuals/sensitivity analyses, meeting the standard for an effective presentation."
