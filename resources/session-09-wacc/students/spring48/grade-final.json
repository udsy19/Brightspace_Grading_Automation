  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly applied the WACC formula components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and produced numeric WACC results and sensitivity scenarios, while also acknowledging key assumptions and limitations. This depth of calculation plus reflective analysis meets the threshold for a thorough, passing treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with explicit inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium) to derive 11.65% and used that value in scenario analyses, showing numerical application. They also reflected on limitations and beta sensitivity to leverage, demonstrating a thorough, conceptually sound treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated and applied the after‑tax cost of debt with explicit inputs and numeric result, used it in WACC simulations, and reflected on the tax‑shield benefit and its limits (distress/costs). This demonstrates a thorough, conceptually sound treatment of cost of debt.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided correct inputs and numeric component results and reported WACC outcomes, showing correct conceptual and numerical application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not present an explicit, block‑by‑block calculation (e.g., writing the WACC formula and showing the term-by-term multiplications) nor a clear statement of personal execution/verification, so the implementation is correct but not fully explicitly demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used the correct CAPM inputs and reported a correct numeric result consistent with those inputs (Rf 4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%), and applied it in analysis, demonstrating conceptual and numerical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show the step‑by‑step CAPM calculation, demonstrate personal execution/verification, or present block‑by‑block methodology, so the implementation is correct but not fully explicitly demonstrated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran multiple sensitivity scenarios and reported specific WACC results and a WACC curve interpretation, showing correct conceptual and numerical sensitivity analysis. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit method/code, step‑by‑step calculations, or personal execution/verification statements (e.g., \"I ran this code / here are the blocks\"), so the implementation is correct but not fully explicitly demonstrated.",

      "driver_alignment": "Reflect — explicitly analyzes tradeoffs between tax shield benefits and distress costs; Implement/Validate — used WACC scenarios and peer comparisons to quantify effects of leverage; Evolve — translated insights into concrete leverage targets and financing recommendations with caveats.",
      "reasoning": "The student articulated the core trade‑off (tax shield vs rising cost/distress), demonstrated it with scenario results and a WACC curve, and gave actionable leverage recommendations while noting risks (credit downgrade, higher equity cost). This combination of conceptual analysis, numeric examples, and strategic advice constitutes a thorough, logical presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs."
