You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt), computes market-value weights, and reports current and post-debt WACC values, plus considers project-specific premiums and leverage effects. Coverage is applied, numeric, and tied to implications, meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, reports a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and integrates it into WACC calculations with capital-weighting. They also reflect on beta changes and project-specific premiums, demonstrating applied conceptual understanding sufficient for a thorough PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax cost of debt formula (yield × (1 − tax rate)) and computes 4.58% from given inputs, integrates this into WACC calculations, and explicitly notes the tax-deductibility benefit. This applied, numeric treatment plus reflection on implications meets the threshold for a thorough pass under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes and reports WACC components and numeric results and performs cross‑checks, showing partial technical correctness. However, under the strict technical standard they fail to explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code\"), block‑by‑block explanation of the implementation, and clear ownership of the code, so full credit is not warranted.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula and reports a numeric cost of equity, and they cross-check results — showing technical understanding. However, under the strict implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code\"), provide block‑by‑block explanations, or clearly own the code, so the work meets PARTIAL but not full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly uses market value (market cap) and debt value and reports correct numeric weight calculations, showing conceptual and numerical application. However, under the strict technical standard they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (no \"I ran this code\"), provide block‑by‑block implementation details, or clearly own the code, so the evidence supports partial credit rather than a full pass.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly frames the decision and objectives for the video.  \nRepresent/Implement — explains method and formulas (CAPM, after‑tax debt), provides numeric results and capital‑structure inputs.  \nImplement/Validate — references visual outputs (graphs) and comparative checks versus peers.  \nReflect — discusses implications and recommendations (tax shield, under‑leverage, project‑specific WACCs).",
      "reasoning": "The presentation conveys a coherent narrative: it defines the decision, explains methodology with numeric examples, shows outputs (graphs), and draws practical conclusions and recommendations. That combination of clear framing, methodological explanation, visual results, and reflective insight indicates an effective video demonstration of understanding."
