You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and explains all WACC components (market values, weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt) and provides specific computed values and validation checks, demonstrating thorough conceptual and applied understanding. The DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate) show depth and correct application, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identified CAPM as the method for cost of equity, recorded relevant inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market return), computed a specific cost-of-equity value, and validated its reasonableness—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly modeled the after-tax cost of debt, collected debt-specific inputs, produced a concrete after-tax cost figure (3.87%), and reflected that taxes materially lower debt cost—demonstrating correct understanding and applied computation consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates correct component inclusion and reports concrete numeric results, showing they implemented the calculation conceptually and produced outputs. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code, block-by-block explanation, or an explicit statement of having run and verified the code themselves, so the implementation evidence is incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified CAPM, listed relevant inputs, and reported a concrete cost-of-equity result, demonstrating conceptual and applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide code, block-by-block explanations, or an explicit statement that they ran and verified the code themselves, so the implementation evidence is incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly stated the market-value methodology, listed inputs, and reported concrete computed market values used to form weights, demonstrating conceptual and applied work.
