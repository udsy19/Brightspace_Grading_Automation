  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the cost-of-equity and full WACC formulas, implements them in code, validates the numeric result, and discusses sensitivity and capital-structure implications. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate evaluation standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements the CAPM (Rf + beta × market risk premium), validates outputs, and performs sensitivity and comparative analyses applying the result to real firms. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the cost-of-equity concept consistent with a PASS under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculates and validates a concrete WACC and explicitly uses it as a hurdle rate, provides project-level adjustments with numeric ranges, and links WACC to financing decisions (debt vs equity). This applied, multi‑example treatment meets the threshold for PASS under the moderate standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements and uses the after-tax cost-of-debt treatment in the WACC formula and demonstrates the tax-shield effect by showing added debt lowered WACC. However, they do not show detailed calculation or estimation of the cost-of-debt itself (e.g., yield, spread, or specific rates), so the treatment is correct but not comprehensive. Hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implements the after-tax treatment of debt in WACC and demonstrates via the debt-increase example that additional debt lowered WACC, showing awareness of the tax-shield benefit. However, they do not explicitly explain the interest-deductibility mechanism or quantify the tax shield (e.g., interest × tax rate), so the treatment is correct but not fully detailed—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and explains the WACC components, inspects the script structure, and personally validated the WACC numeric output, demonstrating partial technical competence. However, they relied on an AI-generated script and did not explicitly show block-by-block code execution, explicit \"I ran this code\" ownership, or detailed flowchart/planning as required by the strict technical standard—so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

        "\"the objective is to code a re reusable Python script that will answer the following financial questions.\"",
        "\"the first part of the script is basically calculating the cost of equity which is going to be the risk-free rate plus beta multiplied by the market risk premium.\"",
        "\"To validate I calculated the weight average cost of capital myself to verify it was done correctly... we can move over to Desmos here and we can see this um weight of equity right here times by the cost of equity... and we get that 11.22%.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover: clearly stated objective and constraints at the start;  \nImplement/Represent: walked through the script structure and explained CAPM and WACC components;  \nValidate: demonstrated manual numeric checking and presented results;  \nEvolve/Reflect: described sensitivity analysis and recommended financing actions based on findings.",
      "reasoning": "The video is organized, explains methodology (CAPM and full WACC formula), presents numerical results and peer comparisons, and shows validation and sensitivity steps. Despite informal speech, the presentation communicates understanding, structured workflow, and actionable conclusions—meeting the moderate standard for an effective demonstration."
