  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a thorough, numerically supported treatment of WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax debt, weighting) and implements/validates the formula in code with Hamada adjustments and scenario analysis, meeting the PASS standard for depth and application.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with explicit inputs (Rf and beta), produced a specific cost‑of‑equity value (11.65%), and integrated it into code and sensitivity analysis (Hamada adjustments). This demonstrates thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed an after‑tax cost of debt with a stated tax rate and integrated the tax shield into the WACC model, implemented and validated in code, demonstrating both conceptual understanding and applied use—meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed all WACC components (CAPM equity, after‑tax debt, weights) and reports running and validating a Python implementation with Hamada adjustments, which demonstrates substantive technical work. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑level code explanation, a flowchart, or step‑by‑step verification detail required for a full PASS, so the work is correct but not documented at the required implementation granularity.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually and reports a numeric cost‑of‑equity and a working script, showing substantive implementation. Under the STRICT technical standard, however, they did not provide explicit block‑level code explanation, step‑by‑step verification, or clear ownership of each function, so the implementation is credible but insufficiently documented for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student references a specific equity market value ($200B) and states they weighted components to compute WACC and ran code to confirm results, which shows partial technical handling of weights. However, they do not explicitly show how market values (especially debt market value) were determined, nor provide code or block‑level explanation of the weighting calculation, failing the STRICT explicitness requirement for a full PASS.",

        "\"It mathematically confirms that issuing the $3 billion in debt is value equative um it lowers the whack from 11.22% down to 11.13%. By effectively utilizing the corporate tax shield without pushing the company into a danger zone.\""

      "reasoning": "The student logically presented trade‑offs—tax‑shield/WACC reduction versus higher financial risk—supported by quantitative analysis (Hamada adjustments and sensitivity sweep) and a cautious recommendation that acknowledges limits (credit rating, tiered hurdles). This demonstrates a clear, well‑reasoned treatment meeting PASS."
