        "\"In the represent stage, I designed my analytical structure and mapped the work to the Python cells. ... Cell C defines the CAPM formula for cost of equity. Cell D calculates the after tax cost of debt... Uh cell E contains the full WACCC computation using market value weights.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Define/Discover — framed the problem and objectives clearly for the audience; Represent — explained the notebook structure and mapped each analytic component to cells; Implement — narrated step-by-step computations with specific inputs and numeric outputs; Validate/Reflect — discussed benchmarks, sensitivity, and practical implications.",
      "reasoning": "The video transcript presents a clear, organized walkthrough: purpose and scope were stated, the analytical workflow and cell-level mapping were described, stepwise computations with concrete numbers were reported, and validation/reflective insights were provided. This combination demonstrates an effective presentation that communicates understanding."
