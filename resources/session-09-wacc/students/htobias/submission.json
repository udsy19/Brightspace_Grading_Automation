  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Hillary Tobias, and this is my video for the Session 9 Assignment. I'll start with the Define and Discover stage of the DRIVER framework. My objective for this assignment is to calculate the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix in connection with a hypothetical $5 billion investment decision. And finding this weighted average cost of capital will help decide if Netflix should take on this investment or not. The scope and horizon for this assignment will be using hypothetical Netflix data for this point in time to help make future decisions about the investment. The constraints for the assignment are that I am limited to the numbers that were provided, so I may need to make some assumptions. My success metric for this assignment will be correctly calculating the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix. And my benchmark for this assignment will be comparing Netflix to its industry peers, Disney and Amazon Prime Video. Continuing with the Define and Discover stage, I'll now discuss the data inventory that was provided for this assignment. I was given several hypothetical financial parameters for Netflix. First, I was given that their market capitalization is $200 billion. The book value of their debt is $14 billion. The current market value of their debt is $13 billion. Their current equity beta is 1.3. Their bond rating is BBB+ and the yield on those bonds is 5.8%. Their corporate tax rate is 21% and their current stock price is $450 per share. I was also given some market conditions for this assignment. The risk-free rate on a 10-year Treasury bill is $4.5%. The market risk premium is 5.5%. And the range for a typical weighted average cost of capital in the media industry is between 8 to 10%. I was also given some strategic context for this assignment. I was told that Disney's capital structure is 70% equity and 30% debt and its weighted average cost of capital is 8.2%. And I was told that Amazon Prime Video uses the Amazon corporate weighted average cost of capital, which is 9.5%. Lastly, I was given that Netflix is considering a $3 billion additional debt issuance for this content investment. Now, I'll move on to the Represent stage of the DRIVER framework. I came up with five steps to help me complete this analysis for this assignment. My first step is to calculate the current weighted average cost of capital for Netflix. And in this step, I will find the current cost of equity using the CAPM formula, I will find the after-tax cost of debt, and then I will interpret the weighted average cost of capital. Step two will be to consider the $3 billion of additional debt financing. And in this step, I will find the new equity beta, the new cost of equity using CAPM, the new after-tax cost of debt, and the new weighted average cost of capital as a result of this additional debt financing. And then I will evaluate and explain how a change in capital structure affects company risk and cost of capital. My third step will be to perform sensitivity analysis on key inputs such as beta and the market risk premium. And in this step, I'll also visualize how the weighted average cost of capital changes with debt levels. And then I will provide an analysis for optimal capital structure and financing strategy. In step four, I will consider project specific discount rates. I will use the divisional cost of capital concept to assess project-specific versus firm-wide discount rates. I will also assess risks related to the new project and I will provide a recommendation of the discount rate to use for this new project. Lastly, in step five, I will do some competition and industry analysis. I will compare Netflix's cost of capital to its industry peers, and I will analyze Netflix's positioning in the industry and understand the competitive implications due to different costs of capital. Now, I'll move on to the Implement stage of the DRIVER framework. In this stage, I provided Google Gemini with the facts of the case study, which were from the Define and Discover stage. And then I asked Google Gemini to write simple Python code to perform the steps from my Represent stage. And this code results in a full report-style output that provides a complete analysis of this hypothetical case study. Now I will switch over to Google Colab to show you my code. The code starts by defining some helper functions that will help format the output and make it look like a structured report. So, it prints headers and subheaders and various calculations and text. And then the code defines a function called \"Run Netflix WACC Analysis,\" and this is the main function that will complete the analysis for Netflix. It starts with part one which is where it does the baseline WACC calculation. So it starts by setting up the current financial parameters for Netflix. Its market capitalization was $200 billion, which is the value of the equity, and then it will use the market value of the debt for the total value of debt. And the reason we need to use the market value weights to calculate WACC is because they represent current investor expectations, whereas book values represent historical data that may not reflect true economic value. So, we use the market value of debt and then whenever we combine that value with the equity market capitalization, we can find the total market value of the firm. The current equity beta of Netflix was 1.3, and its pre-tax cost of debt was 5.8%. And its corporate tax rate was 21%. And then in the next section, it sets up the market conditions which are that the risk-free rate is 4.5%. And the market risk premium is 5.5%. The next section of code is where it prints all of these parameters so you know what numbers you're working with. And then in step two, it calculates different component costs, and it starts with the CAPM formula to calculate the cost of equity. So, in this equation, it uses the risk-free rate, the current beta and the market risk premium to calculate the cost of equity, and then it will use that cost of equity in the calculation of weighted average cost of capital. And then it finds the after-tax cost of debt. And the reason we need to find the after-tax cost of debt is because businesses are able to deduct interest expenses from their taxes. And because of this, the net cost of a company's debt is the amount of interest it's paying minus the amount of interest it can deduct from its taxes. And this benefit is called the tax shield of debt. So, to find this we will take the cost of the debt before tax and multiply it by one minus the corporate tax rate and then the code displays its calculation for the after-tax cost of debt and then it moves on to calculating the weighted average cost of capital. In order to calculate that, the first thing it does is find the weights of equity and debt. So, it takes the value of the equity and divides that by the total firm value to find the weight of equity. And then it takes the market value of debt, divide that by the total firm value to find the weight of the debt. And so once it has all of these numbers calculated, to find weighted average cost of capital, it multiplies the weight of equity by the cost of equity and then adds the weight of debt multiplied by the cost of debt after tax. Next, the code prints the weighted average cost of capital formula and its calculation of that, and then its calculation of Netflix's current weighted average cost of capital, and then it also provides an interpretation of that number. Next, the code moves on to the scenario of the $3 billion of additional debt financing. So, it sets up the new parameters with the new debt issuance and calculating the new market value of the debt. It assumes that the equity value does not change, and then it calculates the total value of the firm and then it prints those parameters to show what numbers it is working with. And so, whenever a new company takes on additional debt, its beta will increase. And this is because the debt interest payments will have to be paid before any earnings are available to shareholders. And so shareholder returns become more volatile, so their systematic risk increases and beta goes up. So equity beta is currently levered. So the Hamada equation is used to find the unlevered beta, and then that same equation can be used to find the relevered beta with the new debt to equity ratio. So that is what the code does next. It first unlevers the current beta to find the asset beta, which is also known as the unlevered beta. And then it uses the new debt to equity ratio to find the new relevered beta. And then the code uses the new relevered beta in the CAPM formula to find the new cost of equity. And then once it finds the new cost of equity, it moves on to finding the new after-tax cost of debt. And so, we will make another assumption here because when a firm takes on more debt, it has a higher debt to equity ratio. And generally when a firm has a higher debt to equity ratio, it is seen as being a riskier company. So since the company will have higher risk, it will probably have to pay a higher interest rate on its debt. So the code is going to assume that the cost of debt will increase by 0.3%, so we use that to find the new cost of debt after tax. So then once it has all of these new numbers calculated, it will use the new weights of equity and debt and the new cost of equity and debt to find the new weighted average cost of capital, and then it will print those results and provide an analysis of how capital structure affects the risk and the cost of capital for Netflix. Next, the code moves on to the sensitivity and visualization, which was step three of my plan. It starts by doing some sensitivity analysis to market risk premium and beta. So, the market risk premium is currently 5.5%. So, it will analyze what would happen if the market risk premium was a little bit lower at 4.5% or a little bit higher at 6.5%. And then the equity beta is currently 1.3. So it will analyze what would happen if the beta was a little bit lower at 1.15, or if it was a little bit higher at 1.45. So, using these different assumptions, it will calculate the new weighted average cost of capital and then display those results and draw a conclusion. And then next it will move on to a visualization of how weighted average cost of capital changes as debt level changes. And so different amounts of debt will result in different debt to equity ratios. And so then the different debt to equity ratios result in different equity betas which changes the cost of equity. And so the code will need to use new weights for debt and equity and new cost of debt and equity to calculate a different weighted average cost of capital for each scenario it goes to. So first it sets up different assumptions for amounts of debt and interest rates on those debt amounts and then it recalculates the cost of equity and the weighted average cost of capital for all of those different debt levels. And then it will display all of those different levels in a chart so that we can compare them. And then it is also going to plot those different amounts of debt and weighted average cost of capital on a scatter plot. and so you can see how the weighted average cost of capital changes as the debt level changes. And then finally in this section, the code will provide a recommendation about whether Netflix should take on the $3 billion of additional debt or not. Next, the code moves on to step four of my plan, which was to consider project-specific discount rates. And so first it will discuss the use of a firm-wide weighted average cost of capital or one that is specific to a certain division or project. And then it will assess some different risks related to new projects and recommend a discount rate to use for this new project. Then next the code defines a new function called \"Run Competitive Analysis,\" and this will be used to compare Netflix to its peers, Disney and Amazon Prime. So it shows all of the different weighted average cost of capital for these different companies and then does a comparison of Netflix to Disney, a comparison of Netflix to Amazon, and finally ends with a conclusion about these comparisons and discusses some of the implications of the different weighted average cost of capital for each firm. Then lastly, the code calls the two main functions that it described to run the \"Netflix Weighted Average Cost of Capital Analysis\" and then the \"Competitive Analysis.\" So I'll run this code so then you can see the output. As you can see, it gave us this full report style output. Part one was the baseline weighted average cost of capital calculation. So, it displays all of the current financial parameters and market conditions, including the market cap of equity, the market value of debt, total firm value, equity beta, pre-tax cost of debt, corporate tax rate, risk-free rate, and market risk premium. And then the first calculation it performed was to find the cost of equity using the CAPM formula. So it took the risk-free rate and added the beta times the market risk premium and it found the cost of equity to be 11.65%. And then it calculated the after-tax cost of debt, and that was found by taking the pre-tax cost of debt, which is 5.8%, and multiplying that by 1 minus the tax rate, which was 21%. And that resulted in an after-tax cost of debt of 4.58%. Next it found the market value weights of equity and debt, and the weight of equity was 93.9% and the weight of debt was 6.1%. And those would have been found by taking, for example, the weight of equity was 200 billion and the total firm value was 213 billion. So 200 / 213 would result in the 93.9%. And then for the debt, 13 / 213 would result in 6.1%. And so then it uses the weighted average cost of capital formula to find that number. And so it uses the weight of equity, which was 93.9%, multiplies that by the cost of equity which was, 11.65%, and then adds the weight of debt, which was 6.1%, multiplied by the after-tax cost of debt, which was 4.58%. And this resulted in a current weighted average cost of capital of 11.22% for Netflix. And then it provides an interpretation stating that this figure represents the blended after-tax cost of all of its capital including both equity and debt. And so, at a minimum, a typical project for Netflix must generate a return greater than this 11.22% hurdle rate to create value for its shareholders, and this is the baseline discount rate for new average risk investments. Part two of the output was the scenario of taking on $3 billion of additional debt financing. And so here it will analyze the impact of this new debt to help finance the new investment. And this new debt would change the capital structure of the firm, which would in turn affect the cost of equity and potentially the cost of debt. First, it sets up the parameters for the new capital structure. The new market value of debt would be $16 billion, and the new total firm value would be $216 billion. So, using those new values, it found the new weight of equity to be 92.59% and the new weight of debt to be 7.41%. As I discussed earlier when going through the code, this different capital structure would affect the beta. So then to find the new equity beta, it unlevered the current beta to find the firm's asset beta, and then it relevers beta using the new, higher debt capital structure. So, the current debt to equity ratio was 0.065. And so then it found the unlevered asset beta to be 1.237. And with the additional debt, the new debt to equity ratio is 0.08, and the new equity beta is 1.315, which was a slight increase from 1.3 previously. And so then it used that new equity beta to find the new cost of equity using the CAPM formula. And it found the cost of equity to be 11.73%, which was also a slight increase from 11.65% previously. And so, then it displays that slight change in cost of equity. And next it moves on to calculating the new after-tax cost of debt. And it states that it is assuming that taking on this additional debt will increase the firm's default risk. And it is going to assume that this will raise the pre-tax cost of debt by 30 basis points, or 0.3%, from 5.8% to 6.1%. So, the new pre-tax cost of debt is 6.1%, and that results in a new after-tax cost of debt of 4.82%. So, using all these new numbers, it calculates the new weighted average cost of capital. And so, the new weighted average cost of capital is pretty similar to the original. They both round to about 11.22%. As you can see, there's not a difference until about the seventh decimal place, so this was a slight decrease in the weighted average cost of capital. And so then the code provides a quick analysis here of how capital structure affects risk and cost of capital. And so, the analysis shows that adding $3 billion in debt increased the debt-to-equity ratio from 0.065 to 0.08, and this had two main effects. The first effect was a higher risk, and since financial risk increased, the equity beta increased from 1.3 to 1.315, and the cost of debt increased from 5.8% to 6.1%. And these increases would increase the weighted average cost of capital. And then the second effect was that more debt means there is more tax-deductible financing, which also tends to be cheaper than equity financing. So, the after-tax cost of this new debt was 4.82%, and that is much lower than the cost of equity, which was 11.73%. And so, this would decrease the weighted average cost of capital. So, the first effect would have increased the weighted average cost of capital; the second effect decreased it. So, the net effect was that the weighted average cost of capital just changed slightly, it decreased slightly. And so that means that the benefit of the cheaper tax shield slightly outweighed the cost of the increased financial risk, resulting in the minor change to the overall weighted average cost of capital. Next is part three of my plan which was the sensitivity visualization and analysis of capital structure. It starts with the sensitivity analysis of some key inputs, such as the market risk premium and beta. So, whenever the market risk premium decreased to 4.5%, the weighted average cost of capital decreased to 10%. And if the market risk premium was higher at 6.5%, the weighted average cost of capital was also higher at 12.44%. And if the beta would have been lower at 1.15, the weighted average cost of capital would have been lower at 10.44%. And if the beta would have been higher at 1.45, the weighted average cost of capital also would have been higher at 11.99%. So, from this analysis, we can see that the weighted average cost of capital is highly sensitive to both the market risk premium and the firm's equity beta because these directly and significantly drive the cost of equity, which in this case is a significant part of Netflix's capital structure at $200 billion. The next part of code is the visualization and scenario modeling of how weighted average cost of capital changes with changes in debt levels. So to find the optimal capital structure, we need to model how the cost of capital will change as debt increases. So, as debt rises the cost of debt and the cost of equity both rise due to risk. And so, the optimal point will be where the weighted average cost of capital is minimized. So what the code does here is assume those different debt levels and find the new value of the debt out of the total firm value. And then it calculates the new pre-tax cost of debt based on the level of debt, and then finds the new cost of equity, and then uses all of these new numbers to find the weighted average cost of capital. So, it starts with a debt level of zero for the baseline. And so, this would be a fully equity financed firm, and so in that case, it's weighted average cost of capital would be the same as its cost of equity. And for this scenario it calculated that to be 11.3%. And then you can see as the level of debt increases, the pre-tax cost of debt also increases because risk increases, and the cost of equity increases as risk increases, but the tax shield benefit that is provided by the debt actually decreases the weighted average cost of capital to begin with. So at $13 billion of debt, we saw that the weighted average cost of capital would be 11.22%. And then we also analyzed the additional $3 billion of debt financing and found a similar weighted average cost of capital at 11.22%, but as we saw earlier, that is actually slightly lower than the $13 billion debt level. And then you can see after that, as the debt level continues to increase up to say $25 billion, $35 billion and $45 billion, the weighted average cost of capital starts increasing again. And this is because too much debt results in higher default risk of the firm, and that begins to outweigh the tax shield benefit of the debt. And this graph created by the code helps to see this. So the blue dots are these various debt levels. And then the vertical axis shows the weighted average cost of capital. And then all of these dots are connected by this U-shaped gray line. And so this shows that initially as the debt level increases, the weighted average cost of capital will decrease because of that tax shield benefit. But then as debt continues to increase, the weighted average cost of capital will begin to increase again. And so this red line shows Netflix's current debt level of $13 billion. And the green line shows the new debt level with $3 billion of additional debt financing. And based on this you can see that the weighted average cost of capital appears to be minimized at the debt level around $13 to $16 billion. And so, the recommendation is that this $3 billion debt issuance seems to be a good move because it takes advantage of the tax shield without significantly increasing risk and results in a lower weighted average cost of capital, which is the goal. Next, the code moves on to part four of my plan, which was assessing project-specific discount rates. And so, the code says that the firm-wide weighted average cost of capital of 11.22% represents the average risk of all Netflix operations. And so, using this as a hurdle rate is only appropriate for projects that have the exact same risk profile as the company average. And an example of this would be another safe US-based content renewal. But for this $5 billion content investment decision that we're analyzing, it would probably not be appropriate to use the company-wide weighted average cost of capital because the investment's risk will probably differ from the company average, and the divisional cost of capital concept states that we should use different discount rates for different business units or different projects such as US versus international projects. So, then the code discusses several risk components of the new investment that need to be considered. The first risk is if it is for US or international content because those will have different risks involved with them. Risks related to US content are primarily market and competitive risks that are well understood, such as major and well-funded US-based competitors like Disney Plus, Max and Amazon Prime. The US economy, currency, and political system are considered to be stable and predictable, so those don't really create risks surrounding US content. However, international content has all of these same risks as US content plus some additional ones, such as currency, political and market acceptance risks. Currency risk is a major factor in this. Netflix earns revenue in the local currency of whatever country the content is in, but it will report its earnings in US dollars. So, if the US dollar gets stronger, foreign revenues translate into fewer dollars, which will hurt Netflix's financial performance. And then another risk is political risk, which is a concern because governments in other countries might impose new rules like content censorship or impose new taxes on streaming services, and so that could also hurt Netflix. And then market acceptance is also a risk because a concept for a show might not translate well across cultures. So, because of these additional risks, the weighted average cost of capital for an international project should be higher than it is for a US project. Another risk to be considered is if the project is for new intellectual property or for an established franchise. A new experimental project is a lot riskier than something that is already well-established, so the new intellectual property would require a higher discount rate. And then a third risk to consider is the business model for the new project. If it is content for the core subscription business of Netflix, then that is not very risky because it's consistent with its main business operations. But if the project is something such as a new, untested, advertising-supported tier of subscription, then that would include more risk and require a higher cost of capital rate assumption. So whenever it comes to selecting a discount rate for this project, it recommends probably not using the firmwide discount rate of 11.22%. The rate would need to be adjusted for the specific risk of the investment. So, you would start with the baseline for the rate using the 11.22% firm-wide and then adjust from there. So, if the project is a safe, US franchise content, then you could just use the baseline weighted average cost of capital. But then if this is kind of an average mix of content that's not too risky, just add about one to two percent. But if this is something that is very new and it is international content, then you would add probably 3 to 5% to the discount rate. And specifically, if the project is for an international content production, a country risk premium would need to be added to the calculation of CAPM, which would increase the weighted average cost of capital. And different countries will add different levels of risk to a project based on that specific country's economic and political position. So the $5 billion investment's cash flow should be discounted using a rate that reflects its specific risk profile, which will probably be in the 12 to 16% range. Now the output shows the last part of my plan, which was the competitive and industry analysis. It starts by showing the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix, which was 11.22%, the weighted average cost of capital for Disney, which is 8.2%, and Amazon's corporate weighted average cost of capital, which was 9.5%. Then it also tells that the average industry range in the media industry for weighted average cost of capital is about 8 to 10%. And so, it analyzes that Netflix's weighted average cost of capital is the highest of the group and it is also above the industry average. And this high cost of capital is a competitive disadvantage for Netflix. And these differences are driven by two main factors - the business model and the capital structure of Netflix. It starts by comparing Netflix to Disney. So it states that Disney is a diversified conglomerate and any weaknesses from its streaming service can be offset by its massive, stable cash flows from its parks and resorts and merchandise, and this lowers Disney's overall systematic risk, and therefore its cost of equity, and therefore its weighted average cost of capital. And then on the other hand, Netflix is entirely based on its subscriber growth and content hits. So, it is a much riskier, more volatile investment, which demands a higher cost of equity and therefore a higher weighted average cost of capital. And then also analyzing capital structure, Disney uses a significant amount of debt financing, which tends to be cheaper than equity financing. Disney has about 30% debt, and this provides that tax shield benefit and pulls its blended weighted average cost of capital down. And then on the other hand, we saw that Netflix uses only about 6% debt and is almost entirely equity financed, so it doesn't get as much benefit from that tax shield benefit and has a higher weighted average cost of capital. And then when comparing Netflix to Amazon, this is Amazon's corporate weighted average cost of capital because Amazon Prime Video is not a standalone business. So Amazon's corporate weighted average cost of capital is more heavily influenced and lowered by its high profit and stable Amazon Web Services cloud division and its e-commerce services. So those services kind of subsidize its video business. And so this means that Amazon's hurdle rate for content is different, and its goal isn't necessarily to profit from the video, but to retain its high-spending Prime members. And so this allows Amazon to overpay for content, whereas Netflix cannot do that. Netflix has to earn a return greater than 11.22% on the content itself. So since weighted average cost of capital is the hurdle rate for new investments, Netflix's high 11.22% hurdle rate is a significant competitive disadvantage for it. A way to illustrate this is that if there was a project with a 10% expected return, it would be rejected by Netflix because it is lower than its weighted average cost of capital at 11.22%. But Disney could accept this project because 10% is greater than its weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%. And so Amazon would be in a similar boat there. And this gives Disney and Amazon more flexibility to bid on content, invest in new markets, and be more patient with financial returns. And Netflix is more positioned as the high-risk, high growth, 'pure play' leader, and it cannot win a cheap capital war. Instead, it has to be a superior capital allocator and chase high return homerun content to justify its high cost of capital and satisfy investors. So basically, since Disney and Amazon are more diversified, their weighted average cost of capital is lower and any losses from their streaming services can be offset by profits from the other goods and services they provide. But Netflix has to make money from its streaming services because that is pretty much its only line of business. Now I'll switch back to my slides and continue with the Validation stage of the DRIVER framework. So in order to validate my analysis, I first checked Netflix's weighted average cost of capital to see if it was comparable to its industry peers, and it was slightly higher, but it was still pretty close, so I felt good about that. I also checked the formulas that the code used, and I manually calculated the relevered beta, the CAPM calculations, and the weighted average cost of capital calculations, and those all resulted in the same thing as the code, so that was good. And then just as an additional double check, I verified with online calculators, and all of my results were still good, and the code ran smoothly. Now I'll move on to the Evolve stage of the DRIVER framework. So from this assignment we saw that Netflix will use its weighted average cost of capital to evaluate taking on this new $5 billion investment or not. So, generally, companies use their weighted average cost of capital as the benchmark for accepting or rejecting long-term investments. And projects that are expected to earn a return at least equal to a company's weighted average cost of capital are accepted because that means they will cover the cost of financing. But projects that have a return that fall below the company's weighted average cost of capital are rejected because they destroy firm value. So, in this case, Netflix will accept this project if it will earn a return of 11.22% or greater. And then this application can be extended to other companies in other industries to evaluate projects for those companies and determine if they should be accepted or rejected. Finally, I'll move on to the Reflect stage of the DRIVER framework. So, one of the biggest takeaways from this assignment was how capital structure significantly impacts a company's weighted average cost of capital. I saw that when a company is fully equity financed, it does not receive any of the tax shield benefit from debt, and its weighted average cost of capital is the same as its cost of equity. But then as the company takes on debt, its weighted average cost of capital decreases because the tax shield benefit is greater than its risk of bankruptcy. But then as debt continues to increase, it does eventually become too high, and the risk of bankruptcy outweighs that tax shield benefit, and the weighted average cost of capital begins to increase again. So, what I can learn from this is that the weighted average cost of capital is a balancing act of finding an ideal capital structure. It requires companies to find the right mix of debt and equity financing that will minimize its weighted average cost of capital. Thanks!",
