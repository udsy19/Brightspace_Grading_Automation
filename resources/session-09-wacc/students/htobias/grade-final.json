  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of WACC components: CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weighting, and levering/unlevering beta with numeric examples and computed WACC. Their Represent and Implement stages show procedural mastery and sensitivity/scenario analysis, and Validate/Reflect confirm accuracy and conceptual implications, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, accurate application of CAPM: states the formula, plugs in numeric inputs to compute cost of equity, re-levers/unlevers beta and recomputes in scenario analysis, and validates results. Multiple numeric examples and sensitivity checks show strong conceptual and practical mastery, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, provides numeric baseline and stressed scenarios (5.8% → 4.58%; 6.1% → 4.82%), and explicitly explains the tax-shield benefit and its impact on WACC. Combined with scenario analysis and validation steps, this demonstrates thorough, accurate treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external and internal validation (peer comparison, online calculators, manual checks), showing validation intent and execution. However, they did not name specific external sources/tools or provide detailed comparison outputs, so validation is credible but not fully documented — therefore PARTIAL.",

This combination of formulaic description, rationale (tax shield, market values), and worked numbers demonstrates a clear, thorough explanation appropriate for PASS."
