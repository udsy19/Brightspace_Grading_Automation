  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and explains WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, weights) and applies them to compute numerical WACC outcomes for multiple scenarios (current, post‑investment, competitor). They also interpret implications (tax shield, optimal leverage), demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly cites and applies the CAPM formula, computes a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and interprets its drivers (beta, market premium) and implications. Implementation and reflection stages show correct application and contextual understanding, meeting the thoroughness expected for a PASS in this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax cost of debt formula, produces a numeric result, and discusses the tax‑shield impact on WACC with comparative examples and strategic implications, meeting the thoroughness standard for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies WACC components, shows computed numeric outputs, and references code, but does not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, detailed block‑level explanation, or full validation (they state validation wasn't possible). This meets partial technical implementation requirements but falls short of the strict evidence needed for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and applies the CAPM formula and reports a computed cost of equity, showing conceptual and partial implementation evidence. However, they do not demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block code understanding, or full validation/ownership required by this strict technical criterion, so the record meets PARTIAL but not PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports explicit market-value numbers and computes the total and weights, showing conceptual correctness. However, they do not demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block code explanation, or validated sourcing of the market values (validation was not completed), so the strict technical requirements are only partially met.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly states the decision problem and objectives.  \nImplement — walks through formulas (CAPM, after‑tax debt, WACC), references code and numeric outputs.  \nReflect/Evolve — interprets results, compares to peer (Disney), and draws strategic implications.",
      "reasoning": "The video systematically explains the WACC methodology, shows the calculation steps and numeric results, and interprets implications for financing strategy — demonstrating clear understanding and effective presentation. The transcript provides explicit goal framing, methodological explanation, and reflective insight, meeting the criterion for PASS."
