  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission shows a thorough, numerically supported treatment of WACC: formulaic calculation of cost of equity and after-tax debt, use of Hamada adjustment for leverage, sensitivity analysis, and clear interpretation of tax shields vs. equity-risk effects. Coverage is detailed and applied to scenarios and peers, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and applies the CAPM formula with concrete inputs and computes a numeric cost of equity (11.65%). They demonstrate procedural mastery by coding helper functions and applying Hamada relever and sensitivity analysis to show how leverage affects equity risk, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computes the after-tax cost of debt numerically, implements it in code, and applies it in WACC and sensitivity analyses while explicitly discussing the tax-shield benefit and its limits. This demonstrates thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its impact on capital structure, satisfying PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implements CAPM conceptually, supplies inputs, and reports a numeric cost-of-equity, demonstrating substantive implementation. However, under the strict technical standard they did not explicitly show block-level code explanations, ownership statements like \"I ran and verified this code,\" or walkthroughs of the helper functions, so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states market-value inputs and reports calculated weights (93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) used in WACC, demonstrating correct methodology. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanations or an ownership statement such as \"I ran and verified this code,\" so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and reported a leverage sensitivity analysis with specific numeric results and interpretation, demonstrating applied use of key inputs. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code walkthroughs or an ownership statement like \"I ran and verified this code\" or detailed verification steps, so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
