  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates thorough, correct treatment of WACC: they show the formulas, compute CAPM-based cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt correctly, use market values, run scenario analysis (additional debt) and project-level betas (US vs international). The combination of clear implementation, numerical results, validation, and strategic application meets the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM (rf + beta * MRP) with stated inputs and produced the accurate cost-of-equity value (11.65%), then implemented and validated the calculation in code and applied adjusted betas to project-level analyses—demonstrating thorough, practical mastery of CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used the bond yield and tax rate to compute after-tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−0.21) ≈ 4.58%), implemented it in code, and demonstrated the tax-shield effect by showing WACC declined when adding debt and by explicitly noting debt is tax deductible. This shows a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its impact on WACC.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student shows personal execution (ran code, computed cost components, and validated results) and included all WACC components conceptually, but did not provide the required strict-level explicitness (no block-by-block code walkthrough or detailed explanation of functions/steps). This meets partial but not full PASS under the strict technical implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student personally executed the CAPM calculation (stated inputs, ran Python, and produced a numeric cost-of-equity), demonstrating practical application. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide a block-by-block code walkthrough or detailed explanation of the implementation steps/functions, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market-value inputs, implemented weight calculations in code, and reported the resulting debt weight (~6%), showing correct determination of market-value weights. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide a block-by-block code walkthrough or detailed stepwise explanation of the weighting implementation, so the submission is a PARTIAL rather than a PASS.",
