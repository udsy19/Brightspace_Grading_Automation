You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents the correct WACC formula and component calculations, supplies specific inputs and numeric outputs (costs, weights, resulting WACC), and demonstrates implementation with helper functions plus scenario/sensitivity analysis. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the CAPM formula, supplies the market inputs (Rf, MRP, beta) and reports the computed cost of equity (11.65%), implements it in notebook helper functions, and uses scenario and validation checks—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student states the correct after-tax debt formula, supplies the yield and tax inputs, computes the numeric after-tax cost (4.58%), and integrates it into WACC with scenario/sensitivity validation. These elements demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield effect, meriting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies correct formulas, helper functions, numeric component values, and validation checks—showing the components were computed and integrated. However, per the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide block-by-block explanation/ownership of the code outputs, so the implementation is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implements CAPM conceptually, provides inputs, helper functions, and a numeric cost-of-equity output (11.65%), showing substantive technical work. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code\"), nor provide block-by-block explanation/ownership of the implementation, so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides explicit market-value inputs and computes the equity/debt weights with a validation check, demonstrating correct determination of weights. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution or block-by-block code ownership (e.g., \"I ran this code\" or explain each function), so the work is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, structured walkthrough—stating objectives, mapping inputs to formulas, showing implementation artifacts, and reporting numeric outcomes and scenarios—demonstrating strong comprehension and effective presentation. The combination of blueprint, code demonstration, results, and reflection satisfies the expectations for an effective explanatory video."
