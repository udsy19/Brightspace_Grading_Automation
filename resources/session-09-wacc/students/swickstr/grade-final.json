  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies CAPM to get cost of equity, computes after-tax cost of debt, uses those weights in a WACC formula, and reports numerical results and scenario analysis (additional debt lowering WACC). They also reflect on implications (beta, credit rating, competitor comparison), showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the CAPM approach (identified inputs: risk-free rate, beta, market premium), executed the calculation in code, reported a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and interpreted beta’s meaning. This demonstrates accurate, applied understanding of CAPM consistent with a thorough treatment for this moderate evaluation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated a numeric after-tax cost of debt (4.58%), explicitly labeled it as after-tax, and demonstrated the tax-shield effect by comparing baseline and +$3B debt scenarios (WACC falling from 11.22% to 11.13%). They implemented the computation in code and reflected on implications, showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed code in Colab, produced numeric WACC and component values, and ran scenario checks—showing partial technical implementation. However, they did not provide the required explicit block-by-block code explanation, detailed verification steps, or clear ownership of the implementation (most code appears AI-provided), so the submission falls short of the strict PASS requirements.\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed code and produced a CAPM-based cost-of-equity number and described the inputs used, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the strict rubric they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, detailed verification steps, or clear ownership of the implementation, so the evidence falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplied the correct inputs and ran code producing WACC components, indicating partial technical implementation of market-value weighting. However, under the strict rubric they did not demonstrate block-by-block understanding, explicit calculation/derivation of the weights, or clear ownership/verification of the code, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover/Represent: defined the decision question and planned to evaluate additional debt's impact.\n- Implement: executed scenario analysis (code in Colab) to quantify effects on WACC.\n- Reflect: interpreted results and offered a financing recommendation while noting perceptual/credit trade-offs.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presented key trade-offs (tax-shield benefit, lower WACC vs. equity risk/beta and investor perception) and produced a quantified scenario supporting a recommendation. However, the treatment lacks depth on downside risks (e.g., financial distress, rising cost of debt, covenant effects) and quantitative sensitivity of those negatives, so the explanation is correct but not comprehensive—hence PARTIAL."

And to find that I use the cap m ... gave the cost of equity using that CAPM model of 11.65... the cost of debt at 4.58... and then our current weighted average cost of capital, I got a return of 11.22%.\"",

      "reasoning": "The student delivered a coherent, structured video that introduced the task, explained methodology (CAPM, after‑tax debt, WACC), reported numeric results, and interpreted implications with a concrete recommendation. The presentation included implementation narration and reflective insight, meeting the moderate standard for effective demonstration of understanding."
