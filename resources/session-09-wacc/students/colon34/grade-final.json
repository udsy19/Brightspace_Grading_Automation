  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly and thoroughly demonstrates understanding of the WACC formula and its components (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt) and applies it (coding, re-levering beta, sensitivity, peer benchmarking). Multiple concrete calculations and scenario analyses show depth beyond a basic description, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM to compute cost of equity (reported 11.65%), implemented the calculation in code, performed unlevering/relevering of beta, and ran sensitivity/benchmark analyses—demonstrating both technical application and conceptual understanding. This depth and applied testing satisfy the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed and reported an after‑tax cost of debt, implemented it in code, and demonstrated how the tax shield lowers WACC (with numeric WACC comparisons and an optimal D/E analysis). They also discussed the trade‑offs and strategic implications, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly included all WACC components (market‑value weights, CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt) and produced numeric outputs and scenario comparisons, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly state personal execution/verification (\"I ran this code and verified...\") nor provide a detailed block‑by‑block code walkthrough or explicit ownership of the code beyond high‑level descriptions, so the work falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented CAPM conceptually in code (including unlever/relever beta), produced a numeric cost‑of‑equity and sensitivity checks, showing correct methodology. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution/verification language (\"I ran this code and verified...\") nor provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough or explicit ownership of each function, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market values (equity = $200B, debt = $13B), described adding them to get total capital, and presented computed weights and outputs, demonstrating correct methodology. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit personal execution/verification language (\"I ran and verified...\") nor a block‑by‑block code walkthrough or granular ownership of functions, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
