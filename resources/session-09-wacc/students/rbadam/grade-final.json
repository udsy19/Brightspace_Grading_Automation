  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains WACC components (CAPM equity, pre- and after-tax debt with a 28% tax shield), uses market vs book values to derive weights, computes a concrete WACC (8.81%), and applies it to project decisions. Multiple examples and explicit implementation/reflection steps show thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and explains after-tax cost of debt (5.5% × (1−28%) ≈ 3.96%), explicitly describes the tax-deductibility mechanism as the tax shield, and applies this to WACC and investment decisions. Numeric example, code-checking, and discussion of implications demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains the tax-deductibility mechanism, shows the formulaic adjustment (×(1−tax rate)), computes a numeric after-tax cost (5.5% → 3.96% with 28% tax), and applies it to WACC and project decisions. Numerical example, code-checking, and discussion of implications demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses CAPM to compute a cost of equity (11.3%) and applies it in WACC and project evaluation, showing conceptual correctness. However, they do not show CAPM inputs or derivation (risk-free rate, beta, market premium) or explain how 11.3% was calculated, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produces correct component values and a numeric WACC, verifies model outputs, and explains key implementation details (e.g., tax shield, market-value weights). However, they do not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation or clearly assert sole ownership of execution (heavy AI use is referenced), so strict technical-implementation requirements for a full PASS are not fully met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student states a CAPM result but provides no explicit implementation details (inputs, formulas, code blocks) or demonstration of personal execution and block-by-block understanding required by the strict rubric. Because the technical ownership and explicit CAPM implementation are missing, this criterion fails.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains the tax-shield benefit and the importance of weighting (market vs book), and applies these ideas when computing WACC, showing an initial, logical presentation of trade-offs. However, they do not discuss countervailing costs of debt (default/bankruptcy risk, agency conflicts, dynamic optimal leverage), so the treatment is correct but incomplete."

        "\"However, notice the calculation for after tax cost debt. We multiply by one minus tax rate. This is because government subsidizes our debt. Interest payments are taxdeductible with a 28% tax rate. Our true cost of debt isn't 5.5. It drops to roughly 3.96. This represents the tax shield.\"",

      "reasoning": "The student delivers a clear, numeric, example-driven explanation of WACC calculation (CAPM for equity, after‑tax debt with the (1−tax) adjustment, market‑value weights) and demonstrates comprehension by applying the computed WACC to project decisions. The presentation includes multiple examples, explicit calculations, and interpretation, meeting the standard for an effective video presentation."
