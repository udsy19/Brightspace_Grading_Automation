  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct grasp of WACC components and calculation (formulas, market-value weights, after-tax debt) and applies them with concrete numeric examples and scenario analysis. They also critically address key assumptions (beta re-levering, credit spread risk), meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula with appropriate inputs and consistent numeric results, demonstrates application in code, and provides project-specific CAPM examples. They also critically evaluate assumptions (re-levering beta), showing depth beyond a basic calculation, satisfying PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, computes the numeric after-tax yield (4.58%), and shows how the cheaper debt reduces WACC. They also demonstrate deeper understanding by evaluating the tax-shield benefit, quantifying contribution to WACC, and noting sensitivity to credit-rating changes, satisfying a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates personal execution (exported and ran code) and correctly reports all WACC components, formulas, and numeric results, but does not provide the required strict-level, block-by-block explanation of the code or explicit ownership of the code logic (e.g., function-by-function descriptions). That incomplete technical narrative meets PARTIAL under the strict implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implements CAPM conceptually, runs code and reports numeric cost-of-equity outputs and validation checks, demonstrating functional execution. However, they do not provide the required strict-level, block-by-block explanation of the code or explicit ownership of each implementation step, so the submission meets PARTIAL under the strict technical standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market values (explicitly cites $13B debt vs book value) and reports computed market-value weights and results from running code, showing partial technical execution. However, under the strict technical standard they do not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit data-sourcing steps (e.g., share count * price), or detailed verification/ownership of the weight calculations, so the evidence meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
