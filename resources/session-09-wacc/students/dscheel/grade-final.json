  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies the WACC objective, specifies the formula components (weights of debt and equity, CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt), provides computed numeric results, and implements scenario analysis via code. These show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses WACC as the decision hurdle (reports 11.22% and states it must be exceeded), implements scenario/sensitivity analysis to see how financing changes that hurdle, and reflects on project-specific application—demonstrating a coherent, applied understanding adequate for PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the cost-of-capital problem, the decision boundary (a $5B content investment), and the intended analyses (current WACC, effect of additional debt, project vs firm discounting), and requests an implementable model—meeting the strict requirement for a clear Define & Discover stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM as the method and reports a computed cost of equity (11.65%) and discusses a high equity beta, demonstrating conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the CAPM formula inputs or step-by-step calculation (risk-free rate, market premium, beta used), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, fitting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports an after-tax cost of debt (4.58%), implements it in scenario analysis, and explains the tax-deductibility reason why debt lowers WACC, showing conceptual understanding. However, they do not show the underlying pre-tax rate, tax rate, or step-by-step calculation of the after-tax cost (limited detail), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, fitting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the tax-shield concept (interest is tax-deductible and lowers WACC) and reports an after-tax cost of debt used in analysis, showing conceptual and applied awareness. However, they do not present the explicit after-tax formula, tax rate, or stepwise calculation of the shield, so the treatment is accurate but not sufficiently detailed for a PASS.",
