You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly presented the WACC formula and all core components (cost of equity via CAPM, after-tax cost of debt, capital structure weights), implemented computations in code, and validated the numeric results. They also analyzed sensitivity and interpreted implications, demonstrating a thorough, correct understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with provided inputs, computed and validated the numeric cost-of-equity, and used it in further WACC analysis and strategic interpretation. This demonstrates a thorough and accurate treatment of CAPM consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined, computed, and validated the after-tax cost of debt using the bond yield and corporate tax rate, and integrated that result into WACC calculations and strategic interpretation (debt cheaper due to tax deductibility). This demonstrates a thorough, accurate treatment consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student used explicit market-value inputs (market cap and market-value debt) and implemented weights in code that produced WACC and sensitivity outputs, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not explicitly show the numeric weight calculations or document how market-value debt was sourced/validated (no block-by-block numeric derivation of weights), so the demonstration of market-value determination for weights is incomplete.",

      "evidence": [
        "\"Okay, so for this project we are looking at basically a decision that Netflix is making with a $5 billion content investment decision...\"",
        "\"we were using a Python program to calculate CAPM, cost of equity, after tax, cost of debt, current and post debt WAC, and WAC sensitivity versus leverage.\"",
        "\"We have a current WAC of 11.21%, which is a hurdle rate for new Netflix investments, and then this means that projects must return more than 11.21% in order to be valid.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "The video covers Discover (clearly frames the Netflix financing decision), Represent/Implement (lists inputs, formulas, and runs a Colab script), Validate (manually checks CAPM and after‑tax debt arithmetic), and Reflect/Evolve (interprets results, sensitivity, and recommends moderate leverage).",
      "reasoning": "The presentation is organized, explains methodology (including automation), shows numeric validation, and draws clear actionable conclusions—demonstrating effective communication of understanding suitable for a PASS."
