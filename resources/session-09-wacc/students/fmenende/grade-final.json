You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM for cost of equity, computed after-tax cost of debt, calculated capital weights from market values, and computed WACC with numeric results and scenario analysis (additional debt and project-specific risk adjustments). This is a thorough, applied treatment that meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed the after-tax cost of debt numerically and explicitly applied it in WACC recalculations, then demonstrated the tax-shield benefit via a debt-issuance scenario and resulting WACC change. This applied calculation plus scenario analysis meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student numerically computed the after‑tax cost of debt and explicitly applied it in scenario WACC calculations, then interpreted the WACC reduction as arising from interest deductibility. This applied calculation plus scenario analysis demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of the tax shield effect.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM inputs and reported a numeric cost of equity, demonstrating conceptual understanding and implementation (DISCOVER + IMPLEMENT). However, treatment is basic—no formula shown, no derivation or discussion of beta sourcing/adjustments or sensitivity—so the work is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the numerical components and a WACC result are reported, the student did not explicitly demonstrate running or verifying code, nor provide block-level explanation of the implementation. Under the strict Technical Implementation requirements, this missing explicit execution and methodological detail results in a FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: While inputs and a CAPM output are reported, the student did not explicitly show they ran or verified code, nor provided block-level explanation or ownership of the implementation. Under the strict Technical Implementation standard, these missing explicit demonstrations result in a FAIL.",
