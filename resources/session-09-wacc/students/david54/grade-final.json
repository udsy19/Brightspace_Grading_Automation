  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains WACC components and CAPM, applies them with correct weighting, after-tax debt treatment, and unlever/relever beta mechanics, and produces numeric results with validation. Coverage is detailed and includes limitations and next steps, meeting the threshold for a thorough understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately explains CAPM conceptually, applies it with correct inputs and arithmetic (producing 11.65% and 11.82%), and demonstrates advanced handling by unlevering/relevering beta and proposing project-level risk adjustments. This depth of explanation plus correct numeric application meets the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly frames WACC as the firm's minimum/benchmark hurdle rate, computes and validates it, and—critically—demonstrates nuanced understanding by rejecting a one-size-fits-all hurdle and recommending project-specific rates and adjustments. This combination of correct application, numeric implementation, and strategic caveats meets the criteria for a thorough treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies after-tax cost of debt in the WACC calculation and computes a numeric after-tax rate (4.58%), showing correct application. However, treatment is incomplete: they do not state the tax rate or explicitly explain the tax-shield mechanism/value, so the coverage is correct but not sufficiently deep for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly uses an after-tax cost of debt and applies it numerically in the WACC (showing understanding that interest is tax-advantaged). However, they do not state the tax rate, show the tax-shield calculation, or explain the mechanics/value of interest deductibility, so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly computes and reports all WACC components (weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt) and validates the result, showing methodological understanding. However, under the STRICT technical requirement they do not provide explicit code, block-by-block explanation, or documented personal verification of the script outputs, so the implementation evidence is incomplete for a full PASS.",
