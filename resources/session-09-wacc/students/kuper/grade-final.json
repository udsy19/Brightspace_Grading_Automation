  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt) and computes weights and a WACC (11.21%), then evaluates the impact of additional debt and compares to peers. Coverage is substantive and includes implementation and reflection, meeting the standards for a thorough, conceptually accurate treatment.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly shows all WACC components (risk‑free rate, beta, market premium for CAPM; debt yield and tax rate for after‑tax cost of debt; market weights) and carries them through to a consistent WACC (≈11.21%), with stated validation. Given the strict technical requirement for explicit demonstration, this constitutes a correct, owned calculation and merits PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defines the cost‑of‑capital problem and the financing decision, lists the required inputs, and outlines the planned calculations, satisfying strict requirements for explicit Discover & Define demonstration. Supporting implementation and validation statements further confirm ownership and understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula and identifies appropriate inputs (risk‑free rate, beta, market risk premium), showing implementation within the broader WACC calculation. However, numerical execution and reporting are inconsistent (vague/incorrect intermediate numeric claim ~20%), so the treatment is correct but basic and incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the after‑tax cost of debt formula (5.8%*(1−0.21)=4.58%) and recognizes the tax‑shield benefit, demonstrating correct conceptual understanding and implementation. However, the treatment is basic and not deeply quantified or explored (limited analysis of the tax shield's impact on WACC and leverage beyond descriptive remarks), so it meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the after‑tax debt formula and explicitly links interest deductibility to tax savings, showing correct conceptual understanding. However, the treatment is brief and lacks deeper quantification or exploration of how the tax shield alters WACC or cash‑flow valuation, so it is correct but incomplete (PARTIAL).",

      "reasoning": "The student logically presents the basic trade‑offs (debt lowers WACC via cheaper financing and tax shields, but increases default/repayment risk). However, the treatment is qualitative and not supported by deeper quantitative trade‑off analysis (no explicit leverage threshold, cost/benefit curves, or sensitivity of equity cost to leverage), so it is correct but incomplete."

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clearly states the problem and decision context; Represent/Implement — walks through inputs, CAPM and after‑tax debt calculations and recomputes WACC; Reflect/Evolve — interprets results, compares to peers, and discusses trade‑offs (tax shield vs. leverage risk).",
      "reasoning": "The student communicates a full end‑to‑end WACC analysis in the video (objectives, inputs, formulas, result, and implications), demonstrating understanding despite some verbal disfluency. The presentation conveys the methodology and key takeaways clearly enough for a knowledgeable reviewer to follow, meeting the criterion for an effective demonstration."
