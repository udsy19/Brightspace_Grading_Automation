  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, accurate understanding of WACC components and calculation: they state the formulas, compute cost of equity and after-tax debt, derive weights and the firm WACC, and analyze effects of additional debt and project risk. Their DRIVER workflow (Represent → Implement → Evolve/Reflect) provides both correct mechanics and applied interpretation, meeting the PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and explains the CAPM, identifies inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market premium), and computes the cost of equity correctly (11.65%), then applies it in the WACC. This is a thorough, accurate treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately defines the tax-shield benefit, states the correct after-tax cost-of-debt formula, computes the after-tax rate, and applies it to a leverage change scenario. This combination of correct formula, numeric calculation, and applied discussion meets the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student presents formulas and numeric outputs, they explicitly attribute the script to an AI and do not show personal execution, verification steps, or detailed methodological ownership required by this STRICT technical criterion. Lacking explicit demonstration of running/validating the implementation and block-level understanding warrants FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student states the CAPM formula and reports the numeric result, they explicitly attribute the work to an AI script and give no evidence of personal execution, block-by-block understanding, or verification required by this STRICT technical criterion. Lack of demonstrated ownership and technical validation warrants FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports market-value weights and the underlying formulas, they explicitly attribute the work to an AI script and provide no personal execution, verification, or block-by-block explanation required by this STRICT technical criterion.
