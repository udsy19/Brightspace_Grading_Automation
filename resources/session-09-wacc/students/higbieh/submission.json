  "transcript": "Hello, this is Holden Higbee, and right now we're looking at calculating the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix. So, this is the script that Google Gemini produced for me. So, we'll go through the driver framework. So, we'll start with section one, the define stage. um and this is where we define the problem and all the information that we're given um so the problem is netflix is considering a new five billion dollar investment in content and we need to figure out what the discount rate or hurdle rate to use to um evaluate this project uh and the rate is that is the WAC. And so what we need to answer is what the current WAC is, what happens if Netflix borrows three billion more to help pay for this, and should we use this WAC for all projects, and how does our WAC compare to Disney or Amazon? And these are the key terms, so the WAC, weighted the average cost of capital. Think of this as the average interest rate for a company that they pay on all of its money from selling stock and borrowing. If our WAC is 9%, any project we do must earn more than 9% to be considered profitable and add value to shareholders capital structure which is the debt to equity mix this is just the recipe of how a company funds itself does it use a 70% equity stock and a 30% debt which is bonds or is it 50 50 this makes is crucial for calculating lack and the cost of equity this is the return and percentage that shareholders demand for the risk of owning a company's stock and we use the formula called CAPM, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, to estimate this, which is what we did in the last chapter, and then the cost of debt, and this is the interest rate and percentage that a company pays on its debt, like bonds, and then the tax shield effect, this is a huge advantage of debt, the interest a company pays on its debt is tax deductible, this tax shield means that the government is essentially paying for a part of our debt and this makes the real cost of debt much cheaper and whack as a hurdle rate the whack is the hurdle a project must jump over if a project returns 10% and our whack is 8% it clears the hurdle if it only returns six percent it trips and we shouldn't do it so obviously like the ten percent is higher than the eight percent so that means that it's like profitable but if it were six percent then it wouldn't be profitable and destroy value so here here are the parameters the market the market cap equity is 200 billion total that market at $13 billion, beta equity, and the beta is just how much Netflix stock fluctuates, so the volatility of it. The bond yield, and that's our pre-tax cost of debt, and the tax rate is 0.21. And then the market conditions, the risk -free rate is 4.5%, and the market risk premium is 5.5 percent that's the extra return investors expect for investing in the stock market instead of risk-free bonds and so the disney whack is 8.2 percent and the amazon whack is 9.5 percent um proposed new debt is 3 billion so that's that's basically all for section one and then we'll head to the represent stage and this is just the formulas for what we will calculate. So the cost of equity using the capital asset model CAPM, KE which is cost of equity equals risk -free rate plus beta which is the volatility times the market risk premium and the after-tax cost of debt which is KD equals the pre-tax bond yield times one minus the corporate tax rate. And that calculates the true cost of debt after the tax yield. And then the weighted average cost of capital, the WAC, equals weight of equity times cost of equity in parentheses plus weight of debt times after-tax cost of debt in parentheses. And this is total value equals the market value of equity plus the market value of debt. And the weight of equity equals the market value of equity divided by total value. And then weight of debt is market value of debt divided by total value. and we can go to the outputs for these first two sections um they'll kind of just tell us the same thing yeah so it just says that all have been defined up here and then down here it has all the formulas and now we can move on to section three so this is the implement stage where we just combine the first two stages to calculate. So we will calculate the three main parts, the cost of equity, after -tax cost of debt, and the WAC. So we should just go down to the output now. So section three, the implement cost of equity, KE, 0.045 plus 1.3 times 0.055 equals 0.1165, and then the after-tax cost of debt is 4.58%. And then total firm value, which is V, equals $213 billion, and the weight of equity equals 93.9% and the weight of debt equals 6.1% and then the final current WAC calculation so there's the formula again and the WAC equals 11.22% which is those two added together. And this 11.22% is our hurdle rate for the $5 billion investment, so they need to get more than 11.22% return. Now we can add to section 4. This is the verify stage where we just check the work and compare it to the u.s um and so we can just go down to the um the output here and our firm wide whack is one point two two percent that represents the hurdle rate um but what if the five billion project is not average um project specific whack a project's discount rate should match its own rate its own risk not the company's um and that example uh the u.s content versus international a one billion dollar investment in stranger things season six a proven u.s hit is probably an average or even below average risk project using our 11 .22 percent whack is very appropriate here and a one billion investment to build a new production studio in emerging politically unstable country is a high-risk project. It has market risk, currency risk, and political risk for this project. You must use a higher WAC to account for the extra risk. The verdict, using a single firm-wide WAC is convenient, but it can be dangerous. It can make us reject good, safe projects because the hurdle rate's too high and accept bad, risky projects because the hurdle rate seems really low so obviously the first example is like a very easy like yes go for it and uh with a appropriate hurdle rate but doing something much riskier with a lower hurdle rate is just asking for um a failure here and it won't receive as much and now we can go to section five this is the evolved stage so enhancing the analysis now we wanted to add new two new pieces to the analysis calculate the new whack if netflix borrows three billion more and compare our whack to peers in the um in their field so let's just go to the output uh new debt and peer comparison uh part one recalculating the whack with three billion more debt the new total debt is equal to 16 billion and the new total value is equal to 216 billion the new weight of equity is 92 .59% and the new weight of debt is 7.41% so we can compare those numbers to up here and and yeah so they are just a little higher. Sorry, lost my place. And then the analysis, Netflix's 11.22% WAC is at the high end of the industry range. And why this versus Disney, which is at 8.2%. Disney has a different capital structure, 70% equity, 30% debt. Our calculation was Netflix, is only 6.1% debt. Disney's higher debt load is likely lowers its WAC versus Amazon, which is at 9.5%. Amazon's WAC is for the entire company, which includes low -risk AWS e-commerce and high-risk Prime Video divisions. Their WAC is a blend of everything, making it a poor direct comparison for Netflix, which is a media pure play so amazon is kind of um using what we talked about up here that like using a firm wide whack is convenient but it can be risky um while disney is not and then the last section uh final recommendations and the reflect um so summary findings netflix current whack is 11.22 this means the 5 billion content investment must have been must have an expected internal rate of return greater than 11 .22% to add value. The impact of new debt issuing $3 billion in debt will lower the WAC to 11.13%. This makes it easier for projects to clear the hurdle. Then project risk, we must be careful to use the SWAC only for projects with average risk high-risk international projects need a higher hurdle rate just so you can know what you're getting into and then recommendations on capital structure the analysis shows that adding debt which is cheaper due to the tax yield can lower our whack this is called optimizing our capital structure and then a final recommendation netflix should proceed with With the $3 billion debt issuance, it lowers the cost of capital, which increases the value of the firm and makes more projects profitable. This optimal strategy only works to a point. If Netflix adds too much debt, bond agencies would downgrade our rating from BBB plus to BB. For example, our bond yield would skyrocket and our beta, so that's the volatility, would increase, making our stocks just move a lot more than it already does. And then this would cause the whack to go back up. For now, this $3 billion move appears to be smart and a value-adding decision. Thank you.",
