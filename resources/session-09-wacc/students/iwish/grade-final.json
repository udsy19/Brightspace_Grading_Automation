  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents clear formulas for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, and WACC, computes numeric examples (component costs and WACC), validates the outputs, and draws strategic implications. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC calculation and its components.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined CAPM, explained its components, applied the specified inputs, and validated the computed cost of equity (11.65%). This demonstrates a thorough, accurate application of the CAPM consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined KD*(1–T), applied the given bond yield and tax rate to compute the after‑tax cost (4.58%), validated the value in their calculations, and interpreted the tax‑shield benefit for capital‑structure strategy. This demonstrates a thorough and applied understanding of after‑tax cost of debt.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student applied the correct WACC formula, ran calculations in a collab, and validated the numeric results, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanation, a clear statement of personally running/debugging the code, or granular ownership of implementation steps required by the STRICT technical standard, so the score is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM inputs and validated the 11.65% result, showing personal calculation and use of a collab. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit statements of running/debugging steps, or detailed ownership of implementation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported market‑value weights (market cap + market debt = $213B and resulting 93.9%/6.1% weights) and validated those figures, showing correct methodology for weight determination. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block implementation details, code ownership statements, or stepwise verification of the computation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

        "\"The assignment we were given is to calculate the weighted average cost of capital or WACC for Netflix in connection with a hypothetical 5 billion dollar content investment decision.\"",
        "\"The equation is K which rep uh represents cost of it's K equals RF plus beta time MRP.\"",
        "\"so we have the cost of equity is 11.65% after tax cost of debt 4.58%... Netflix's current WACC is going to be 11.22%... the 5 billion content project must exceed the 11.12% return that was shown in the new WACC.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the problem and objectives clearly;  \nRepresent — stated formulas (CAPM, KD*(1–T), WACC) and defined components;  \nImplement — referenced running calculations in Colab and produced numeric results;  \nValidate — cross‑checked/calculated outputs and compared to industry peers;  \nEvolve/Reflect — interpreted results as a hurdle rate and recommended capital‑structure action.",
      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear, organized walkthrough: problem framing, explicit formulas, implementation in a collab, numeric outputs, validation against peers, and strategic interpretation — demonstrating effective presentation and comprehension of the WACC methodology. The student communicates methodology, results, and business implications sufficiently to meet the criterion."
