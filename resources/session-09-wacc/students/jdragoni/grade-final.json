You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provides a clear, correct formula and computes components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt), produces numerical WACC examples (baseline and with added debt), and runs sensitivity and validation analyses. These demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM, computes numeric Ke (domestic and international), and uses it in sensitivity and validation analyses, demonstrating depth and applied understanding. The mix of formula, numerical examples, coding implementation, and reflection meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculates the after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−0.21) = 4.58%), applies it in WACC with market value weights, and demonstrates via code and scenario analysis how the tax shield reduces WACC impact from additional debt. Their explanation and validation of the tax‑shield effect show thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compares their WACC to peer companies and an industry benchmark and interprets differences, demonstrating validation intent and external benchmarking. However, they do not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, published reports), so the validation is substantive but lacks explicit external-source references required for a full PASS.",
