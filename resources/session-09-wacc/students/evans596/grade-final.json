  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC: they specify the formulaic elements (CAPM cost of equity, un-lever/re-lever beta, after-tax debt), provide numeric WACC outcomes and component changes, and explain why WACC moved (tax shield vs. cost of equity). Coupled with implementation details and reflective peer comparison, this meets the PASS standard for depth and completeness.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly uses CAPM, implements un-lever/re-lever beta and a cost-of-equity function, and reports numeric cost-of-equity outcomes across scenarios with interpretation. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM-based equity costing sufficient for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly models after-tax debt (reports a numeric after-tax debt rate) and explains how the tax shield and capital mix reduce WACC, with applied comparison to Disney and a proposed $3B debt issuance. Implementation details plus reflective interpretation demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield benefit, meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission shows implemented calculations, scenario execution, and interprets numeric WACC outcomes, indicating correct components were included (CAPM, un-/re-lever beta, after-tax debt). However, it lacks the strict explicit technical implementation required: no block-by-block code walkthrough, no clear statement of personal execution/verification, and no explicit flowchart or stepwise ownership—so it cannot earn a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly invokes CAPM, implements a cost-of-equity function, and reports numeric outputs showing CAPM-driven changes, demonstrating conceptual and practical use. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide an explicit personal code walkthrough, block-by-block explanation, or a clear statement of having run and verified the code themselves, so the submission earns PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student runs a script and reports capital-structure percentages, there is no explicit statement or demonstration of how weights were derived from market values (no market cap, enterprise value, or market-value-of-debt calculation shown), no block-by-block code walkthrough, and no explicit personal verification. Under the STRICT technical standard, this missing explicit methodology and ownership requires a FAIL.",

The answer is that the tax- is the tax shield and the capital mix... we replaced a small slice of expensive 11.73% ... equity financing with a much larger slice of cheap ... 8% after tax debt. And the benefit of this cheap debt, even in small amounts... outweigh the new higher cost of the equity. This is the classic WACC trade-off...\"",
        "\"Netflix is only 6.1% debt... Disney is 30% debt. Disney is aggressively using low cost debt to lower its WAC. And Netflix is almost entirely financed by expensive equity.\"",
        "\"Finally, on the financing, the $3 billion debt issuance is a clear, value-creating move... By adding more low cost debt, which would further lower its WACC and increase overall... firm value.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the financing decision and hurdle-rate question.  \nImplement — ran scenarios and reported numeric component changes (beta, cost of equity, after‑tax debt).  \nReflect — interprets trade-offs (tax shield vs. rising equity cost), compares peers, and recommends financing policy.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, logical account of capital‑structure trade‑offs with numeric examples (costs, debt percentages), explains the mechanism (tax shield and capital mix) for WACC movement, and draws actionable conclusions (peer comparison and $3B debt recommendation). This depth and applied reasoning meet PASS."
