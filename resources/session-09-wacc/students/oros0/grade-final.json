  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described and applied CAPM for cost of equity, the after-tax cost of debt, and the weighted formula using market-value weights, produced numerical WACC results, and analyzed the impact of new debt and peer differences. Their work shows comprehensive, accurate treatment of WACC components and implications (implemented in code and reflected on results), satisfying the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used CAPM with stated inputs, implemented it in working code, produced a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and discussed its implications for WACC and peer comparison. This demonstrates a clear, applied, and correctly interpreted understanding of the CAPM cost-of-equity calculation consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used an after-tax cost-of-debt formula, implemented it in working code, and produced a numeric after-tax rate (4.58%) that was applied to WACC, demonstrating correct calculation and application. They also explained the tax-shield benefit qualitatively and linked it to strategic implications for leverage, meeting the moderate requirement for conceptual understanding and thorough application.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used CAPM conceptually, ran code and reported a numeric result, showing partial technical implementation. However they relied on AI-generated code and provided only a brief description of the CAPM function—no block-by-block walkthrough, explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership statements, or detailed explanation of the implementation. That meets PARTIAL under the strict technical-implementation standards.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified and supplied market-value inputs and ran code that produced WACC results, showing conceptual and partial technical implementation. However, they did not explicitly show the weight calculations (no step-by-step or block-by-block explanation) nor an explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership walkthrough required by the strict rubric, so the evidence supports a PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed limited sensitivity checks (at least one financing scenario and a +1% project risk premium) and implemented them via code, showing partial scenario testing. However, they did not present a systematic sensitivity analysis across multiple key inputs (e.g., ranges for beta, RF, MRP, debt cost) nor provide explicit, block-by-block verification or ownership of extensive scenario testing required by the strict rubric, so the work is partial rather than a full PASS.",
