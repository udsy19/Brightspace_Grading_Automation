  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its components: they identify cost of equity and after‑tax cost of debt, use market weights, compute and unlever beta, and perform sensitivity (adding $3bn debt) with project‑specific WACCs. The treatment is detailed and includes calculation choices, assumptions, and interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM concepts: choosing inputs, unlevering/relevering beta, and producing a concrete cost of equity (11.65%) used in WACC and project‑specific rates. They also demonstrated thoughtful application (US vs international betas) and interpretation, meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated and used an after‑tax cost of debt (yield and tax rate provided), ran a leverage sensitivity (adding $3bn) and discussed the tax‑shield benefit and impact on WACC. This applied, numeric, and interpreted treatment meets the PASS standard for thoroughness.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student included the necessary WACC components and reported numeric results and assumptions, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT standard they did not explicitly show step‑by‑step calculations, code/verification, or block‑level execution/ownership required for a full PASS, so the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM concepts, provided inputs and a resulting cost of equity (11.65%), demonstrating conceptual and partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not show explicit, block‑by‑block calculations, code execution, or stepwise verification/ownership needed for a full PASS, so the work is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly acknowledged and used market‑value weights and reported an equity share (>90%) in their WACC computation, showing partial fulfillment. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit calculations, data sources, step‑by‑step derivation, or verification of market values (e.g., market cap and debt market value), so the evidence is incomplete for a full PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: framed the financing decision (large content investment) requiring capital structure analysis.  \n- Implement: computed current leverage, cost components, and sensitivity to a $3bn debt addition.  \n- Reflect: weighed tax‑shield benefits vs. higher equity cost and rising yields, and recommended a gradual leverage strategy.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the trade‑offs: identifies an equity‑heavy capital structure, quantifies cost differences (equity vs. after‑tax debt), runs a leverage sensitivity, and interprets implications (tax shields, higher beta/yields, cautious debt increases). The analysis is explicit, balanced, and leads to actionable recommendations, satisfying PASS."

      "reasoning": "The student communicates a logical, end‑to‑end presentation: defining the problem, explaining methodology and inputs, showing results, and giving actionable conclusions. Delivery has some verbal hesitations but the explanation is coherent, systematic, and interpretable, meeting the moderate standard for an effective video presentation."
