  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission provides specific WACC components (cost of equity, debt/equity weights, WACC percentage), documents implementation to compute them, and reflects on key conceptual issues (project-specific discounting, tax shield, leverage implications). These elements show a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student supplied the CAPM inputs (rf, beta, market risk premium) and the resulting cost of equity (11.65%), implemented computationally via Python, and discussed its implications (high beta → higher equity cost). This combination of specific parameters, a computed result, and conceptual interpretation meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided numeric inputs for cost of debt (5.8%) and tax rate (21%), implemented calculations in Python to show WACC changes after additional debt, and explicitly discussed the interest tax shield and leverage implications. These specific values, computation, and conceptual interpretation demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and tax-shield benefits, meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported WACC components and scenario results and ran iterative code, showing partial technical implementation. However, they did not provide the required strict-level evidence of personal, block-by-block code understanding or explicit ownership (detailed function-level explanation or flowchart), and they acknowledge AI assistance—so the submission meets PARTIAL but not full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed a specific CAPM-based cost of equity (11.65%) and described iterative personal work in Python, showing partial technical implementation. However, they did not provide the strict, block-by-block code explanation, explicit verification steps, or full ownership required for a PASS, and they acknowledge AI assistance—so the evidence supports PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student calculated and reported market-value weights (current and post-issuance) and ran Python to obtain them, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, they did not provide the strict, explicit evidence required (block-by-block code explanation, explicit verification statements, or clear ownership without reliance on AI), so this meets PARTIAL but not PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student identifies and quantifies the benefit side of leverage (tax shield, lower WACC) and contrasts Netflix’s risk profile with a stable peer, showing awareness of trade-offs. However, the treatment lacks a balanced, detailed discussion of downside costs of higher leverage (financial distress, increased default risk, effect on beta/cost of equity) or quantified trade-off analysis, so the presentation is correct but not sufficiently thorough for a full PASS."
