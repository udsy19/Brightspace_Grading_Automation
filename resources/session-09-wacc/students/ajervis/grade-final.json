  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student offers a clear, detailed explanation of WACC components (capital structure, CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt), provides specific numeric inputs, and walks through the calculation and decision rule—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS. DRIVER stages (Define, Reason, Inputs, Visualize, Reflect) consistently support a strong conceptual and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and explains CAPM, supplies concrete numeric inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market return), and applies the formula within the WACC/project evaluation—demonstrating both conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS. The DRIVER stages (Reason, Inputs, Visualize) show the explanation and usage are complete and practical.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax shield concept, supplies numeric inputs, and explicitly applies the after‑tax cost formula (pre‑tax × (1 − tax rate)) in the WACC computation, demonstrating both conceptual and applied understanding consistent with a PASS. The Reason, Inputs, and Visualize DRIVER stages show clear, accurate treatment of the cost of debt and its tax benefit.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly explains each WACC component and the code’s step‑by‑step calculations, demonstrating technical understanding. However, strict implementation requirements ask for explicit personal execution, run results, and clear ownership/verification (e.g., \"I ran the code and verified the output\" or shown outputs), which are absent—so the submission is correct but not fully demonstrably executed, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and explains the CAPM implementation and supplies numeric inputs, demonstrating block‑level understanding of how cost of equity is computed. However, under the strict technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or verification (no statement of running the code or showing outputs), so the submission meets understanding but not the full execution/ownership requirement—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly details using market values (shares × price; face value × market price) to compute E/V and D/V and shows where those weights feed into validation. However, under the strict technical standard there is no explicit personal execution or verification (e.g., \"I ran the code and verified outputs\"), so technical completeness/ownership is not fully demonstrated—hence PARTIAL.",
