  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a thorough, specific treatment of WACC: it defines the metric, specifies market-based inputs, applies CAPM and after-tax debt, computes weights and numeric WACC, and validates the outcome versus peers. These elements across the Represent and Implement stages show strong mastery beyond a basic discussion, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains and justifies CAPM inputs, shows the representational step to compute cost of equity, and reports the correct numerical CAPM result (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%). The work applies the cost of equity in subsequent WACC calculation and interpretation, demonstrating thorough, accurate understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and justifies inputs (5.8% yield, 21% tax), shows the representational step to compute after-tax cost, and reports the correct numeric result (5.8%×(1−0.21)=4.58%). They also apply the tax-shield logic to WACC and capital-structure recommendations, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student demonstrates technical implementation intent and reports concrete numeric outputs from Python, and they clearly mapped steps to the WACC components (weights, CAPM, after-tax debt). Under the STRICT technical standard, they fall short of full credit because they did not include or explain the actual code, show stepwise verification, or explicitly assert personal execution and block-level understanding—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified inputs and produced the correct CAPM result (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%), showing conceptual and numerical competence. Under the STRICT technical standard, absence of explicit personal execution, code, or block-level explanation prevents a full PASS, so the work is rated PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market values for equity and debt and computes the resulting weights (evidence in Represent and Implement), demonstrating conceptual and numerical correctness. Under the STRICT technical standard, the submission lacks explicit code, execution details, or block-level explanation/verification, so it cannot receive full credit—hence PARTIAL.",

        "[\"This creates a core trade-off: equity financing offers high flexibility and no mandatory payments but comes with a high required return of about 11.65%, whereas debt financing imposes contractual obligations and covenants but has a much lower after-tax cost of roughly 4.58%.\"]"

      "reasoning": "The student presents numeric evidence (costs and WACC), articulates the economic trade-off (expensive equity vs cheaper tax‑shielded debt), models a concrete leverage scenario and delivers a defendable target range with caveats—demonstrating a clear, logically structured presentation of capital-structure trade-offs."
