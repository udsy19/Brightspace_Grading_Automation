  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, market and capital-structure inputs), provides numeric inputs and computes multiple WACC applications (current, post-$3B debt, and project-specific betas), and validates with sensitivity analysis. This depth and applied examples meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states and implements the CAPM formula, supplies clear numeric inputs, reports the correct resulting cost of equity (11.65%), and applies adjusted betas to show project-level variation. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applies the after-tax cost formula using provided bond yield and tax rate, reports the numeric result (~4.6%), and links the tax-deductibility benefit to WACC changes with a $3B debt scenario and sensitivity analysis. These steps demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of cost-of-debt and the tax shield.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly ran the notebook, supplied numeric CAPM inputs, stated the CAPM formula, and validated the resulting cost of equity, demonstrating correct implementation and verification. However, they did not provide block-by-block code explanation or explicit ownership-level details of each function/step required by the strict technical standard, so the evidence supports a partial rather than full pass.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies market-cap for equity and a debt figure, computes resulting weights (reported as ~94% equity / 6% debt) and states they ran and validated the calculations, demonstrating partial compliance. However, they do not explicitly show block-by-block code, nor do they explicitly document whether debt was valued at market vs. book or walk through the weight-calculation steps line-by-line, so the strict technical requirement for full explicit demonstration is not fully satisfied.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and reported multiple sensitivity/scenario analyses (leverage curve, $3B debt scenario, project beta variations) and validated results, showing meaningful exploration of key inputs. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide block-by-block code explanation or explicit ownership-level detail of the sensitivity implementation, so the evidence supports a partial rather than full pass.",
