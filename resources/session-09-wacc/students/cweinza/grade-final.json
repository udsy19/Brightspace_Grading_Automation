  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−21%) = 4.58%), explicitly noted the tax-shield effect, and implemented it in the WACC model (resulting in a lower WACC). This demonstrates correct conceptual understanding and practical application, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculated the after-tax cost of debt using (1−tax rate) and labeled this the tax-shield effect, implemented it in the WACC computation, and discussed how low leverage reduces the benefit and why increasing debt could lower WACC. This correct explanation, numeric example, and applied interpretation meet the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies WACC as the hurdle rate for average-risk projects, implements the calculation, and discusses when and how to adjust it for higher-risk projects, demonstrating both practical application and conceptual understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains key WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, and weight calculation) and implemented them in code, showing conceptual understanding (DISCOVER/IMPLEMENT). However, contradictory numeric outputs in the walkthrough undermine completeness and precision, so the treatment is correct but not thorough enough for a full PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes and applies CAPM conceptually (risk-free rate + beta × risk premium) but inconsistent numeric reporting (9.65% vs 11.65%) indicates gaps in execution or transcription. Conceptual understanding is present but not demonstrated thoroughly and reliably, so PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented a WACC function, described block-by-block behavior, and reported outputs, demonstrating partial technical competence. However, inconsistent reported component values (e.g., 9.65% vs 11.65% cost of equity), limited explicit evidence of running/verifying the code, and no clear ownership of results prevent a full PASS.",

        "[\"Hello my name is Clara Weinzapfel, and today I'm going to be going over the session 9 assignment. ... This presentation outlines the weighted average cost of capital or WACC analysis for Netflix tied to a hypothetical $5 billion content investment.\"]",
        "[\"This uses the capital asset pricing model CAPM. The risk-free rate 4.5%. Plus the risk premium 5.5% scaled by the beta 1.3 gives a cost of equity of 9.65%.\"]",
        "[\"The recommendation is that Netflix should continue to increase its debt utilization toward the peer average. for example, 15% to 25% debt weight.\"]"
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "The DISCOVER stage frames the presentation and objective; the IMPLEMENT stage walks through the code blocks and methodology (CAPM, after‑tax debt, WACC function); the REFLECT/EVOLVE stages interpret results and give actionable financing recommendations—showing a full DRIVER narrative in the video.",
      "reasoning": "The presenter structures the video clearly, explains methodology (CAPM, tax shield, WACC function), and ties outputs to recommendations, demonstrating understanding beyond surface level. However, inconsistent numeric reporting and reliance on AI-generated code without clear verification reduce polish and undermine full effectiveness, so the presentation is competent but not thoroughly convincing."
