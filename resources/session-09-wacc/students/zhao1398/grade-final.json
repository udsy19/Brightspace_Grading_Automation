  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes WACC components (equity and debt), uses market-value weights and tax-adjusted debt, and applies these to compute and sensitize WACC with concrete numerical results and policy implications. The DRIVER stages show a complete workflow from inputs through implementation to reflection, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies and uses correct CAPM inputs (RF, MRP, beta) and integrates the resulting cost of equity into a WACC calculation, sensitivity analysis, and decision rules. The DRIVER stages show end-to-end handling from input discovery through implementation and reflection, indicating a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly reports pre-tax cost of debt and tax rate, applies a 3B debt issuance in their WACC computation, and quantifies the resulting reduction in firm WACC, demonstrating correct use of after-tax debt effects and the tax shield in analysis. The DRIVER stages show end-to-end handling from input discovery through implementation to reflection, supporting a thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly show personal implementation, verification, and block-level understanding. They state they used Gemini and report results but provide no formulas, code, stepwise calculations, or ownership of execution—so the requirement for explicit technical demonstration is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block methodology, or verified calculations. The transcript only supplies CAPM inputs and AI-generated outputs without any owned calculation, formula application, code, or verification, so the requirement is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies market-value inputs and reports the implied weights (94%/6%), showing correct conceptual use of market values for WACC weights. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit stepwise calculations, formulas, or personal verification/implementation of the weight computation, so the evidence is correct but incomplete.",
