  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately applied the WACC components (CAPM for equity, market weights, and tax-adjusted cost of debt), computed and compared current and post-issuance WACC, and reflected on managerial implications—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with explicit inputs, showed the formula and numeric computation, verified the result on paper and in code, and used the output in subsequent WACC analysis—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of cost-of-equity calculation. The Implement and Reflect stages show both execution and appropriate application, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the after-tax debt formula with explicit numbers, integrated the after-tax cost into WACC computations, and explicitly explained the tax-deductibility benefit—showing both calculation and managerial implication—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student executed CAPM, provided explicit inputs, ran code, and manually verified the numeric result—demonstrating correct implementation. However, they did not show block-by-block code explanation, flow/logic of functions, or detailed ownership of the implementation as required by the strict technical standard, so this meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and applied weights using explicit numeric values and verified the arithmetic, demonstrating partial technical competence. However, they did not explicitly show how the market values were determined (data sources, market vs. book treatment) nor provide block-by-block code explanation or ownership of the data-gathering step required by the strict technical standard, so the result is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly ran and validated a sensitivity check on increased debt (13 → 16B) and reported the resulting WACC change, demonstrating partial sensitivity analysis. However, the work only varies one input (leverage), lacks systematic multi‑input scenario or range testing (beta, RF, MRP, cost of debt), and includes an imprecise magnitude claim—so it meets PARTIAL under the strict technical standard.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly quantified the WACC benefit from added debt, explained the tax‑shield and cheaper‑debt rationale, acknowledged the bankruptcy-risk downside, verified results, and proposed a practical leverage target—demonstrating a clear, logical presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs."
