  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, accurate treatment of WACC components and formula: market-value weights, CAPM for cost of equity, and (1–T) tax shield for after-tax cost of debt, plus numeric application and sensitivity analysis. These elements across Discover, Implement, and Reflect stages satisfy the criterion at a PASS level.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, provides concrete input assumptions (RF, beta, MRP), and produces the numeric result (11.65%), then integrates it into the WACC analysis. Minor verbal inconsistency (an offhand \"11%\") does not undermine the correct conceptual use and numeric implementation, so the treatment merits a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the after-tax cost of debt formula (Rd*(1–T)), provides numeric inputs and result (5.8% → 4.58%), and integrates the tax-shield effect into WACC and strategic recommendations. The explanation, numeric example, implementation, and reflection together constitute a thorough, accurate treatment meriting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes all WACC components (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, pre-tax debt and after-tax adjustment, numeric weights and outputs) and reports computed results, showing partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show explicit block-by-block code explanation, explicit \"I ran/verified\" ownership details, nor fully consistent numeric reporting—so the submission is correct in substance but lacks the required explicit implementation evidence.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies and applies CAPM (inputs and numeric result 11.65%), showing conceptual and numeric correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide explicit block-by-block code, a clear \"I ran and verified\" statement, or detailed explanation of the implementation steps/outputs, so the submission demonstrates correct substance but lacks required explicit implementation evidence.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly chose market-value inputs and reported the computed equity/debt weights, demonstrating correct methodology and numeric application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show block-by-block code, explicit \"I ran/verified\" evidence, or stepwise implementation details, so the submission is substantively correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration — therefore PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a logical, data-backed trade-off: quantifies current capital structure, models the WACC impact of additional debt, and links tax-shield benefits to lower WACC and shareholder value while acknowledging financial risks. Numeric scenarios and a concrete recommendation (target debt range) provide the necessary depth and applied reasoning to pass."

      "reasoning": "The video verbally walks through the objective, inputs, methodology (CAPM, after‑tax debt, market‑value weights), numeric results, sensitivity scenarios, and a recommendation—demonstrating clear understanding and effective presentation. Minor verbal inconsistencies do not undermine the overall coherent explanation and applied insights, so this meets the standard for a PASS."
