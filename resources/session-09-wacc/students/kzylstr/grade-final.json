You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the WACC components and formulas, supplies numerical inputs and computed results, and validates them with sensitivity and peer comparisons, demonstrating deep, applied understanding. The treatment is comprehensive (formulas, calculation, scenario modeling, and interpretation), meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula with explicit numeric inputs and derives the correct cost‑of‑equity, then explores sensitivity across beta scenarios and links implications to WACC. The treatment is detailed, applied, and validated, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax debt formula with numeric inputs and computed KD (5.8% → 4.58%), uses it in the WACC calculation, and explicitly explains the tax‑shield benefit and its effect on lowering WACC and informing leverage strategy, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external validation by comparing the calculated WACC to industry ranges and specific peer WACCs, demonstrating intent and application of benchmarking. However, they did not cite the specific external data sources or tools used (e.g., Damodaran, Bloomberg, company filings), so the validation is present but lacks the explicit sourcing required for a full PASS.",
