  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines WACC, uses market-value weights, applies CAPM for cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt, and provides specific numeric results and interpretation (weights, 11.65% equity, 4.582% debt, resulting WACC ~11.13%). Depth of discussion, validation and strategic implications demonstrate a thorough, competent treatment of the WACC formula and components.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and explains CAPM conceptually, applies it (reports beta = 1.3) and provides a specific calculated cost of equity (11.65%), and links the result to WACC implications. While raw input values (exact risk-free rate and market premium) aren’t quoted in the transcript, the explanation, numeric result, implementation, and reflection together demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates an after-tax cost of debt (4.582%), names the tax shield as the reason it's cheaper than equity, and uses those results in WACC analysis and strategic recommendations. Implementation (calculation with Collab) and reflection on underleverage and tax-shield implications show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes and reports all WACC components and numeric results, and shows validation steps, so the calculation is substantively correct. However, per the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block understanding of the code, or ownership (relying on Google Gemini/Collab without saying \"I ran and verified\" or explaining the implementation), so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states CAPM, reports a numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and beta (1.3), and indicates use of scripting and validation—showing substantive implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran and verified this code\"), nor provide block-by-block explanation or ownership of the code, so full PASS is not warranted.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses and reports market-value inputs and derives the equity/debt weights, demonstrating substantive understanding. Under the STRICT technical standard, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran and verified the code\"), nor show block-by-block methodology for deriving the debt market value, so full PASS cannot be awarded.",

      "driver_alignment": "Represent: presented capital-structure weights and WACC formulas; Implement: calculated WACC and showed effect of shifting to higher debt; Reflect: recommended increasing leverage to capture tax-shield benefits and improve NPV.",
      "reasoning": "The student logically links high equity weight to a higher WACC and quantifies the potential benefit of more debt (tax shield, lower WACC, higher NPV). However, they do not discuss the countervailing costs or risks of higher leverage (financial distress, higher future cost of debt, agency effects), so the treatment is correct and practical but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL."
