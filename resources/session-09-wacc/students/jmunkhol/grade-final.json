  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a clear WACC formula and components, implements calculations (CAPM and WACC) in code, and reports and interprets numerical results including effects of additional debt and project-specific rates. Depth of explanation, applied examples, and reflection on implications meet the threshold for a thorough, PASS-level treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly frames WACC as the investment hurdle and implements calculations to produce numeric WACC and project-specific hurdle rates, then uses those rates to inform the $5B content decision and capital-structure recommendation. This is a applied, well-supported treatment that goes beyond a brief definition, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly automated WACC computation (described using Google Gemini → Colab) and implemented reusable functions (CAPM and WACC), then applied outputs to multiple scenarios (current vs. post-debt, project-specific hurdles). This demonstrates effective integration of finance and technology at a level that satisfies the PASS standard for a moderate-evaluation category.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and implements CAPM (mentions a CAPM function and uses it in code) and interprets the role of beta in raising cost of equity relative to peers. However, they do not show the CAPM formula components or an explicit numeric cost-of-equity calculation (risk-free rate, market premium, or resulting Re), so the treatment is correct but not fully detailed — hence PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly describes after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield concept, implements calculations in code, and interprets the impact of additional debt on WACC. However, they do not show explicit numeric calculation of after-tax Rd (e.g., yield, tax rate, or the Rd*(1–T) computation) or detailed tax-shield math, so the treatment is conceptually correct but not fully detailed — therefore PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-shield concept and applies it qualitatively (showing that added debt reduces WACC via tax deductibility) and implemented code to assess debt impacts. However, they did not present explicit numeric tax-shield calculations (e.g., Rd*(1–T) or incremental tax savings), so the treatment is conceptually correct but not fully detailed — therefore PARTIAL.",
