  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the WACC formula, applied CAPM for cost of equity, used after-tax cost of debt and market-value weights, and produced consistent numeric results (including a what-if with added debt and project-specific WACCs). Coverage includes formulas, inputs, calculations, interpretation and recommendation, meeting the threshold for a thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM formula, provided all necessary inputs, performed the arithmetic to obtain 11.65%, and integrated this result into the WACC and recommendation. This demonstrates a clear, applied understanding of calculating cost of equity consistent with the DRIVER Implement and Discover stages, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified inputs (bond yield, tax rate), applied the after-tax debt formula and provided the numeric result, and explicitly used the tax-shield reasoning in recommendations. This demonstrates a clear, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its impact on capital structure consistent with DRIVER Implement and Reflect stages.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed limited sensitivity analysis (a debt-issuance scenario and project-specific WACCs), showing correct direction and numeric results, but did not present a systematic, explicit sensitivity sweep (e.g., ranges or tornado table across key inputs) or detailed methodology/procedures required under the strict technical standard. Therefore the work is correct but incomplete for a full PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission shows manual calculation and scenario analysis but contains no explicit evidence of automation (no Excel/model files, code snippets, macros, or description of automated workflows). Under the criterion requiring demonstration of any automation, the absence of such explicit artifacts or explanation warrants a FAIL.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed external-style validation by comparing Netflix's WACC to peers and an industry range, demonstrating awareness of benchmarking. However, they did not cite specific external data sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Damodaran, market reports), so validation is present but not explicitly sourced, yielding a PARTIAL.",
