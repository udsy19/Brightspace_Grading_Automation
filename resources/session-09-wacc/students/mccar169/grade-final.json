That detailed, applied treatment meets the \"thorough\" standard for this moderate category.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined CAPM, produced a specific cost-of-equity value (11.65%), used it in subsequent WACC computation, and reflected on its implications—demonstrating applied and conceptually thorough treatment consistent with a PASS under the moderate standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student defined the after‑tax debt formula, produced a specific numeric after‑tax cost (≈4.58%), used it in the WACC computation, and explicitly interpreted the tax‑shield benefit and its impact on WACC—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports correct component values and final WACCs, they do not demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding of the code, or ownership (code was \"given to us by Gemini\" and no explicit \"I ran/verified\" or explanation of functions). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration, this absence of concrete implementation evidence results in FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, and ownership of the CAPM implementation. The transcript shows the CAPM was described and a result reported, but the code was attributed to Gemini/AI with no explicit \"I ran/verified\" statements, no code walkthrough, and no demonstration of ownership—therefore FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block understanding, and ownership of the implementation.

      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains both sides of the capital‑structure trade‑off (lower financial risk with low leverage vs. lower WACC and more projects viable with higher leverage), quantifies the effect with weights and WACC outcomes, and connects this to strategic recommendations—demonstrating a coherent, logical presentation."
