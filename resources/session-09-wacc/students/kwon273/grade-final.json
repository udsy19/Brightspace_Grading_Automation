  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, component-level understanding of WACC: they state the CAPM formula, compute after-tax cost of debt, use market-value weights, and produce a numeric WACC with scenario and sensitivity analysis. Multiple DRIVER stages (Represent/Implement/Validate) show both conceptual and applied mastery, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student states the CAPM formula, provides concrete inputs (risk-free rate, MRP, beta), computes a numeric cost of equity (~11.65%), and applies alternative beta scenarios—demonstrating both conceptual understanding and applied calculation. Multiple DRIVER stages (Represent, Implement, Validate/Reflect) show thorough, defensible treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the rationale (tax-deductibility), applies the formula with concrete inputs to compute an after-tax cost of debt (~4.58%), and evaluates the tax-shield's effect when adding leverage. Multiple DRIVER stages show both conceptual understanding and applied analysis, satisfying the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student describes methodology and numeric results but never mentions any automation, code, spreadsheet model, data pipeline, or tool-based implementation. Under the criterion requiring explicit demonstration of automation, the submission provides no evidence of automated WACC calculation or reproducible tooling, so it fails.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly performs external validation by comparing results to peer WACCs and running sensitivity tests (Validate/Implement). However, they do not cite specific external sources, tools, or data providers for the peer numbers, so validation is present but lacks the explicit source-level corroboration required for a full PASS.",
