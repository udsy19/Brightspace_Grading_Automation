  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates thorough, correct understanding of WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weighting) and applies them to compute current and post‑issuance WACC plus sensitivity analysis. Their workflow (Discover→Implement→Reflect) shows depth, validation, and awareness of refinements, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the CAPM formula with provided inputs, produced the correct numeric result (11.65%), and validated it programmatically. Their implementation and reflection (including suggested improvements) demonstrate a thorough, accurate understanding of cost of equity via CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated the after‑tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−21%) = 4.58%), applied it in WACC computations, validated results programmatically, and discussed the tax‑shield benefit and leverage tradeoffs, demonstrating a thorough and accurate treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct numeric components and described using AI‑generated Python and validation steps, showing partial technical execution. However, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution details, block‑by‑block code understanding, or ownership of the code (no code walkthrough or explicit \"I ran X and Y\" explanations), which are required under the STRICT technical standard for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually and produced/validated the numeric cost of equity, but under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit personal execution details, block‑by‑block code explanation, or clear ownership of the implementation. This meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identified and intended to use market values for equity and debt and instructed the implementation to use market‑value weights, and they state they validated the calculations. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit personal execution evidence (e.g., \"I ran the code\", code snippets, or a block‑by‑block walkthrough), so the submission demonstrates correct intent and partial technical validation but lacks the explicit ownership/detail required for a full PASS.",
