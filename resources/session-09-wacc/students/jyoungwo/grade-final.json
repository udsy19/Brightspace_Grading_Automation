  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula and CAPM cost-of-equity, uses market-value weights, computes component rates (equity beta→11.65%, after-tax debt→4.58%), produces firm WACC numerically (11.21%) and runs sensitivity/peer comparisons. Coverage is specific, applied, and includes implications and recommendations, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM (Rf + beta × market risk premium), computes a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and interprets its implications versus after-tax debt and peer betas. They demonstrate both conceptual understanding and practical application across scenarios, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the tax shield concept, uses the given pre‑tax yield (5.8%), corporate tax rate (21%), and market debt to compute an after‑tax cost of debt (4.58%), and integrates this into WACC calculations and policy recommendations. Coverage includes numeric calculation, interpretation, sensitivity/peer analysis, and actionable recommendations, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct WACC components and numeric results and referenced implementation in Google Colab, demonstrating partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT implementation standard they did not explicitly show personal code execution, block‑by‑block code explanation, or an explicit displayed flowchart/ownership of the code, so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states CAPM, applies it and reports a numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and uses the result in analysis, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, block‑by‑block explanation, or ownership of the code/run outputs (no shown code snippets, run logs, or stepwise verification), so the submission cannot receive a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states using market values, gives the underlying numbers (market cap $200B, debt $13B) and reports computed weights (93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) applied in scenarios — demonstrating correct conceptual and numerical determination of weights. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit execution evidence (no shown code, run outputs, flowchart image, or block‑by‑block explanation/ownership), so the submission meets partial but not full PASS.",
