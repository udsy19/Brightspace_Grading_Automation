  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents the WACC formula, correctly defines its components (E, D, V, Re, Rd, tax shield), applies CAPM for equity and after-tax treatment for debt, uses market-value weights, and runs scenario/sensitivity analyses — demonstrating thorough, applied understanding. Minor numeric/typo slips appear but do not undermine the comprehensive conceptual and applied treatment, so the work meets PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies CAPM, states inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market premium), computes a firm-level Re and uses alternative betas for project-specific Re, demonstrating applied and nuanced understanding. Minor numeric/typo inconsistencies appear but do not undermine the thorough conceptual and practical treatment, meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and uses the after-tax cost of debt via the (1 − tax rate) adjustment, supplies a corporate tax rate, computes an after-tax Rd, and demonstrates the tax-shield effect in scenario analysis. Minor numeric/typo inconsistencies appear, but the conceptual understanding and applied calculations are thorough, supporting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes the correct WACC formula, uses CAPM for Re, applies after‑tax Rd and market‑value weights, and presents scenario results, showing conceptual and applied use of all components. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not explicitly show code, block‑by‑block execution, or detailed verification steps—so while the calculation appears conceptually correct, the required explicit technical demonstration is incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies the CAPM formula with clear inputs and a computed Re, demonstrating conceptual and numerical implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show code, block‑by‑block execution, or explicit verification steps (no demonstrated run/output logs or explanation of code functions), so the submission is incomplete technically and rates PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly chose and justified market‑value weights, supplied market value inputs, and reported computed weights (e.g., ~93.9% equity) and scenario recalculations. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit execution evidence (code, run outputs, block‑by‑block explanations or verification), so the technical demonstration is incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the financing decision requiring trade‑off analysis (the $5B project and $3B potential debt). Represent — mapped how leverage enters the WACC framework and affects components. Implement — ran a debt‑issuance sensitivity scenario and produced a WACC chart showing the leverage trade‑off. Evolve/Reflect — drew strategic conclusions and recommended an optimal incremental leverage strategy.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly explains the trade‑off between tax benefits of debt (lowering WACC) and increased financial risk (raising WACC beyond a point), demonstrates this with numerical scenario and a sensitivity chart, and offers a reasoned recommendation balancing debt shield capture against rating risk — a thorough, logical presentation meeting PASS standards."
