  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission explains the WACC formula and each component (market-value weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt) and applies them across multiple scenarios with sensitivity analysis and economic validation. These elements show a thorough, applied understanding that meets the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined and implemented CAPM, produced a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), applied relevering for leverage changes, and validated results with sensitivity analysis and discussion of estimation limits. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined and implemented the after‑tax cost of debt (RD*(1−T)), computed numeric post‑tax debt costs for base and post‑debt scenarios, and discussed how the tax shield interacts with leverage and rising credit risk. This is a thorough, applied treatment that meets PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specified all WACC components, described the functions to compute them, produced numeric WACC and component values, and performed validation. However, they did not explicitly show code, demonstrate having run it, or walk through block‑by‑block implementation/ownership as required by the STRICT technical standard, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described CAPM, planned and described a CAPM function, and produced/validated a numeric cost‑of‑equity. However, they did not show the actual code, demonstrate running it (\"I ran this code and verified...\"), nor walk through block‑by‑block implementation or ownership as required by the STRICT technical standard, so the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market‑value concepts and produced numeric weights (93.9% equity, 6.1% debt), and described building functions to compute them. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show code, demonstrate having run it (\"I ran this code and verified...\") or provide block‑by‑block implementation/ownership, so the evidence supports PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "Represent — set up scenarios linking leverage changes to WACC; Implement — ran sensitivity analysis and reported numerical impacts of incremental debt; Validate/Reflect — interpreted economic trade‑offs (tax shield vs default/equity risk) and gave an explicit target debt range and strategic recommendations.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the capital‑structure trade‑offs with conceptual explanation (tax shield vs rising risk), numeric examples (debt weight shifts, WACC sensitivity), and a concrete recommendation (8–12% debt). The combination of theory, scenario results, and strategic guidance demonstrates a logical, well‑supported presentation meeting PASS."
