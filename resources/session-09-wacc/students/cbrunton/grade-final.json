  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of the WACC formula and its components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), provides specific numerical calculations, and applies sensitivity and scenario analysis showing how component changes affect WACC. The depth, numeric detail, and testing against benchmarks satisfy the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, provides specific inputs and a correct baseline calculation (11.65%), and demonstrates application through scenario and sensitivity analyses (e.g., cost of equity rising to 11.73% when beta increases). These elements show thorough, accurate understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes after-tax cost of debt with specific numbers (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), integrates it into the WACC formula, and demonstrates through scenario analysis how the tax shield lowers WACC but can be offset when debt raises required returns. This combination of correct calculation, numeric examples, and scenario-driven interpretation meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly includes all WACC components, provides numeric inputs and a correct aggregate WACC, and shows validation against benchmarks. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not explicitly demonstrate personal execution details (block-by-block code explanation, ownership of runs, or a clear flowchart), so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies CAPM with specific inputs and numeric outputs and demonstrates scenario-driven adjustments, showing substantive understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation or an unambiguous statement of personal execution/verification of the code, so full PASS cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values and computed weights (200bn equity, 13bn debt → weights ≈94%/6%) and validated results, showing substantive technical understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation or clear personal execution/verification details, so full PASS cannot be awarded.",

        "\"If we don't assume that the market reprices risk then Netflix's WACCC actually falls a little bit from 11.22 to 11.13. That's because debt is cheaper than equity. So more debt slightly lowers the average cost of capital.\"",
        "\"So in scenario B, beta rises from 1.3 to about 1.315. The cost of equity rises to 11.73%. Cost of debt increases to about 6.05% pre-tax. And because both of the both of both of these increases, um, WACCC comes right back 11.22%. So the tax shield benefit basically gets canceled out by high investor required returns, meaning adding leverage doesn't necessarily save um, Netflix money.\"",
        "\"This first this first visualization is WACCC versus debt share ranging from 10 to 20 billion dollars of debt. Um you see that slight U shape here. um WACC dips a little bit as debt increases and slow slowly creeps back up. It's a kind of classic trade-off situation.\""

      "driver_alignment": "- Represent: laid out the conceptual framework (WACC formula and trade-offs between debt/equity).  \n- Implement: executed scenarios and produced numeric outcomes (baseline, added-debt scenario A, repricing scenario B) and a visualization of WACC vs debt.  \n- Reflect/Validate: interpreted results (tax-shield vs. repricing) and validated logic against theory/benchmarks.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the capital-structure trade-offs with concrete scenarios, numerical examples, and a visualization showing the U-shaped WACC response to leverage. They explain both the benefit (tax shield lowering WACC) and the countervailing effect (investor repricing raising required returns), providing a thorough, logically consistent treatment that merits PASS."
