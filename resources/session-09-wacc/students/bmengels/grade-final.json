  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the cost-of-capital task and identified required parameters and methodology (WACC formula), satisfying the Define & Discover stage. They linked the analysis to a clear financing decision (moderately increase debt to a 15–20% target), demonstrating an end-to-end understanding appropriate under the strict DRIVER expectation.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The submission names a specific external source (Google GEMI) and performs a peer comparison with Disney, reporting numeric relation and interpretive commentary, which satisfies the Validate requirement for cross-checking against industry benchmarks. The evidence shows external validation rather than a purely internal check.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the problem, performed analysis and peer comparison, and provided a clear, actionable recommendation with a target range and rationale linking capital-structure differences to WACC outcomes. This satisfies the Reflect requirement for explicit insights on optimal capital structure and financing strategy.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly named and applied key WACC components (CAPM for equity, market-value weights, after-tax debt) and reported calculated WACC values, showing conceptual competence. However, the treatment lacks detailed component calculations (e.g., beta, market premium, tax rate, step-by-step weighting), so the coverage is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified CAPM as the method for cost of equity and applied it conceptually within the WACC calculation (Discover/Implement), and reported WACC outcomes and comparisons (Reflect). However, they did not show the CAPM inputs or a specific computed cost-of-equity figure (beta, risk-free rate, market risk premium), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly referenced calculating the after-tax cost of debt and incorporated a new debt weight into the WACC, showing conceptual application (Discover/Implement). However, they did not present the actual cost-of-debt calculation, tax rate, or explain the tax-shield benefit in detail, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, yielding PARTIAL.",

      "reasoning": "The presenter communicates the assignment structure, methodology, results, and recommendation, showing conceptual understanding. However, the delivery is verbally disfluent and lacks detailed stepwise explanation or supporting numeric breakdowns, so the presentation conveys understanding but not at the polished, thorough level required for a full PASS."
