  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents the correct WACC formula, CAPM and after‑tax debt treatment, and explicitly models leverage effects (Hamada/unlever-relever) with numeric results and sensitivity checks. The combination of formula discussion, code implementation, and benchmarking demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding sufficient for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM, implements it in code, produces explicit cost-of-equity figures, and demonstrates how leverage changes equity risk and r_e—including a re-levering example—meeting the thorough application standard for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax cost of debt formula, computes the numeric after‑tax rate (5.8% × (1–21%) = 4.582%), and integrates it into WACC and capital‑structure discussion, including recognition of the tax shield—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding suitable for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states CAPM, describes helper functions, and reports computed cost-of-equity values—evidence of an implemented CAPM. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly state they ran and verified the code or provide a block‑by‑block explanation of each function in the transcript, so the submission demonstrates correct implementation but lacks the explicit execution/ownership detail required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran and reported a concrete sensitivity analysis (debt weight → WACC) and interpreted the results, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not provide an explicit block‑by‑block code walkthrough or an explicit statement of independent execution/verification in the transcript, so the work is correct but lacks the explicit, detailed execution evidence needed for a full PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly compares the computed WACC to peer-company and industry benchmark figures and interprets the result, demonstrating validation activity. However, they do not cite external data sources or tools used to obtain those benchmark figures, so validation is present but lacks the explicit source-level corroboration required for a full PASS.",
