  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct application of the WACC formula and its components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and shows scenario analysis (marginal cost after $3B debt) plus benchmarking and project risk adjustments. These elements, supported by implemented code and reflection on inputs/implications, meet the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies CAPM numerically (Rf + beta×MRP = 4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%), integrates that cost of equity into WACC via code, and discusses beta selection and sensitivity for project decisions. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculates after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−0.21) = 4.58%), integrates it into the WACC model via code, and analyzes the quantitative impact (9 bp WACC reduction) and strategic implications. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes WACC correctly and implemented a coded model and validation/benchmarking, showing partial technical execution. However, they do not provide explicit, block‑by‑block explanation of the code, clear evidence of personally running and verifying each step, or full ownership independent of AI assistance — so the strict technical standard for PASS is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM numerically and integrates it into a coded WACC model and validation workflow, demonstrating technical understanding of the formula. However, they do not provide explicit, block‑by‑block code explanations, nor a clear statement of personally running/verifying each code component and ownership of the implementation, so the strict technical standard for PASS is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market values and computes weights (200/213 and 13/213) and reports implementing this in code and validating outputs, demonstrating correct conceptual and applied use of market-value weights. However, they do not provide the strict technical evidence required (block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit \"I ran and verified\" ownership statements), so the strict implementation standard for PASS is not met.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — framed the decision problem and objectives clearly at the start; Represent — laid out the WACC framework and numeric component calculations; Implement — described coding/automation and ran pre/post issuance scenarios; Validate/Evolve/Reflect — benchmarked to peers, ran sensitivities, and drew strategic implications.",
      "reasoning": "The transcript shows a coherent video presentation that states the problem, explains methodology step‑by‑step with numeric examples, demonstrates implementation (code runs and scenario outputs), and connects results to decision rules and strategy. This breadth and concreteness satisfy the criterion for an effective presentation."
