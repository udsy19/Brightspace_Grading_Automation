  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, specific grasp of the WACC formula and components (explicitly cites risk-free rate, beta, MRP, computed cost of equity/debt and numeric WACC) and applies it to a capital structure change and project-risk differentiation. Reflection on tax shields, beta effects, and peer comparisons shows comprehensive understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains using WACC as a firmwide hurdle for average‑risk projects, demonstrates numeric application, and provides concrete examples (discounting US vs international content, risks of using a single hurdle). The discussion of project‑specific adjustments and capital‑budgeting consequences is substantive and meets the threshold for a thorough, PASS evaluation.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided explicit market‑value inputs and reported the pre‑ and post‑issuance debt values and resulting weights, which are numerically consistent (13/213 ≈ 6.1%, 16/216 ≈ 7.4%). This shows correct, explicit determination of market‑value weights and meets the strict technical demonstration requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies CAPM inputs and reports specific cost-of-equity results, showing applied understanding (Implement) and reflection on leverage effects. However, the submission lacks a clear step‑by‑step CAPM calculation (explicit RF, MRP, beta multiplication and final formula derivation), so the treatment is correct but not sufficiently detailed for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and computes a numeric cost of debt and conceptually discusses the tax-shield benefit and its impact on WACC, showing applied understanding (Implement + Reflect). However, they do not explicitly show the after‑tax cost‑of‑debt calculation (kd*(1–Tc) or numeric application of the tax rate), so treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly recognizes and discusses the tax-shield concept and its effect on lowering WACC, and applies it to capital-structure recommendations (Reflect + Implement). However, they do not show an explicit after‑tax cost‑of‑debt calculation (kd*(1–Tc) or numeric application of the corporate tax rate), so the treatment is conceptually correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",

        "\"we're supposed to calculate the whack for Netflix and whack is weighted average cost of capital for Netflix in connection with the hypothetical $5 billion content investment decision.\"",
        "\"so we're going to figure out the cost of equity for Netflix. We're going to put in the risk-free rate, the equity beta, the market risk premium... we're going to get current cost equity of 11.65%. And then we're going to calculate the cost of the debt, which is 4.58%.\"",
        "\"Netflix should continue to increase its proportion of debt finances to benefit from the tax shield and reduce its overall whack... a debt to value ratio 15 to 20% range would likely minimize their whack.\""

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — clear statement of the task and scope (WACC for $5B decision).  \nRepresent — explained methodology and inputs (CAPM inputs, cost of debt).  \nImplement — reported numeric results (cost of equity, cost of debt, WACC before/after).  \nReflect/Evolve — interpreted results and gave strategic recommendations (tax shield, target leverage).",
      "reasoning": "The presentation clearly outlines objectives, explains the WACC methodology with specific component values, walks through before/after implementation, and offers reasoned recommendations—demonstrating understanding and coherent communication. Despite informal phrasing and some conversational filler, the content is organized, substantive, and meets the criterion for an effective demonstration."
