You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), provides specific numeric calculations (current WACC, debt tax shield) and implements them in code, and reflects on implications and sensitivity — meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly applied CAPM with clear inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market risk premium), reported the computed cost of equity (11.65%), implemented it in code, and linked the result to WACC outcomes and strategic implications — satisfying the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates pretax and after-tax debt rates (with numeric conversion), incorporates after-tax cost of debt into WACC computations (including a debt issuance sensitivity), and interprets the tax-shield effect on funding costs and capital structure — meeting the thoroughness standard for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The submission includes the correct WACC components, numerical inputs and outputs, and a stated Python implementation, showing technical capability. However, it lacks the STRICT-category required explicit evidence of personal execution, block-by-block code explanation, and ownership (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\" or stepwise code walkthrough), so it cannot receive PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: While the student reports a CAPM result and references a Python script, they do not provide explicit evidence of personal execution, block-by-block explanation of the implementation, or verification steps (e.g., \"I ran this code and checked...\"). Under the STRICT technical standard requiring explicit demonstration and ownership, the submission fails to meet the required level.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provides explicit market-value inputs and computed weights, showing they determined and used market-based weights, but under the STRICT technical standard they fail to show personal execution, block-by-block code explanation, or explicit verification (e.g., \"I ran this code and checked...\").
