  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly identifies and applies the WACC formula (market-value weights, CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt), computes numeric components and the blended WACC, and reflects on implications (peer comparison, sensitivity, capital-structure change). Coverage is detailed and applied, meeting the threshold for a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, provides the input values (Rf, beta, MRP), computes the numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and interprets its meaning and impact on WACC and project decisions. Implementation and reflection evidence show applied understanding beyond a brief mention, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applies the after-tax cost-of-debt formula (5.8%*(1−0.21)=4.58%), explains why interest is tax-deductible, quantifies the per-dollar tax saving (≈1.22%), and links this to WACC and capital-structure decisions. This demonstrates accurate calculation, conceptual understanding, and applied reflection, meeting the standards for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies all WACC components and reports numeric results (cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, blended WACC), showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block implementation details or show/explain the code/calculation steps and ownership beyond \"I ran it,\" so full technical demonstration is incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specified CAPM, provided inputs and the numeric cost-of-equity result, and reported running code, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not provide the code, block-by-block explanation, or explicit ownership/detail of the implementation steps, so the technical demonstration is incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market-cap and market debt inputs, states the V=E+D method, and reports numeric market weights and their change after new debt, demonstrating correct methodology. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show the code, stepwise calculations, or block-by-block implementation/ownership, so the technical demonstration is incomplete.",

      "reasoning": "The student quantifies costs and weights, explains the tax‑shield benefit, demonstrates the numeric impact of additional debt on WACC, and discusses risks/implications—providing a clear, logical presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs and actionable recommendations."
