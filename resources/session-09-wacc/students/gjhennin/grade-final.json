  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM for cost of equity, computed after-tax cost of debt, used market-value weights, and produced numeric WACC results and a debt-sensitivity analysis—demonstrating both calculation and interpretation. Their discussion of leverage effects, optimal WACC, and project-specific discount rates shows comprehensive, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with explicit inputs and a mathematically consistent result (4.5% + 1.25*5.5% ≈ 11.38%), demonstrated implementation via pre-run code, and interpreted the result within the WACC analysis. The combination of precise inputs, numeric computation, and contextual interpretation supports a thorough understanding meeting PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated after-tax cost of debt (6%*(1-21%) = 4.74%), ran the implementation, and explicitly discussed the tax-shield benefit and the trade-offs of increased leverage as applied to WACC—demonstrating both correct computation and thoughtful interpretation consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student ran code and reported correct component values and a WACC result, demonstrating some technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block explanation, verification steps, or clear ownership/defense of the implementation, so the submission meets only partial technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM inputs and produced the expected numeric cost of equity, demonstrating conceptual and computational correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide personal execution details, block-by-block explanation of code, or explicit verification/ownership of the implementation, so the submission meets only a partial technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced explicit market-value weights and an equity market-value figure, indicating partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT standard they did not show how market values were computed, provide block-by-block code explanations, or document verification/ownership of the calculation, so the requirement is only partially satisfied.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents both sides of the capital-structure trade-off (tax-shield benefits lowering WACC initially versus rising financial risk that increases costs), supports it with numeric scenario results, and gives actionable recommendations to model and find optimal leverage. This depth, concrete example, and practical guidance meet the standards for PASS."
