  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student presents a thorough, specific treatment: they define WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, weights), execute numeric calculations and a debt-scenario simulation, and reflect on practical implications (tax shield, distress risk, project acceptance). These elements meet the standards for a comprehensive understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defined and applied CAPM, plugged in risk-free rate, beta, and market premium to compute a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and implemented the calculation in code. They also recalculated equity cost under changed leverage (unlever/relever beta) and interpreted the economic implications, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and applies after‑tax cost of debt (uses cost of debt and tax rate in the WACC formula), implements numerical calculations and a debt‑increase scenario, and reflects on the tax‑shield benefit versus financial distress—constituting a thorough, applied treatment that meets PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student includes all WACC components, numeric inputs, and a computed WACC (11.2%), and they ran code to produce and validate a leverage scenario—showing partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, provide block‑by‑block explanation of the code, or explicitly claim full ownership of the implementation, so the submission falls short of a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard, the student must explicitly demonstrate personal execution, explain code blocks, and take ownership. The transcript shows reliance on AI and a numeric CAPM result, but lacks a clear, explicit walkthrough of the implementation, explicit code verification by the student, or ownership—so it fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market-cap and market-value-of-debt to compute equity/debt weights and demonstrates recalculation under an additional-debt scenario, showing conceptual and numeric application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, provide a block‑by‑block code walkthrough, or clearly claim ownership of running/verifying the code, so the implementation evidence is incomplete.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly presents the core trade‑offs: tax‑shield benefits of additional debt, rising cost of equity with leverage, and escalating debt costs/distress risk that produce a U‑shaped WACC. They support this with both conceptual explanation and a concrete leverage scenario, meeting the standard for a logical, thorough presentation."
