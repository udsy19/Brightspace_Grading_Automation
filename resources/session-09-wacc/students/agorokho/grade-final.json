  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of the WACC formula and its components (CAPM for equity, after-tax debt, market-value weights), applies it with numeric examples, and performs sensitivity/project-specific analyses. Their DRIVER stages (Define/Discover, Implement, Reflect) show both correct methodology and thoughtful treatment of assumptions, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states and applies the CAPM formula, provides numeric inputs and a computed cost of equity, and uses alternate betas for project-specific analyses while reflecting on assumption choices. These demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies the after-tax cost of debt (5.8% yield × (1−21%) ≈ 4.5%), incorporates the tax shield into WACC calculations, and demonstrates its impact via a debt-issuance sensitivity analysis. They also reflect on how rising leverage would affect borrowing costs, showing a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies the WACC formula, reports component values and a final WACC, and ran calculations in Python (Implement). However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code excerpts, block-by-block explanation, nor an explicit statement verifying they personally executed and debugged the code; therefore the implementation is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM conceptually and reports a computed cost of equity, indicating implementation effort. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code excerpts, block-by-block explanation, or an unequivocal statement verifying personal execution and debugging; therefore the implementation is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market-value equity and debt inputs and computed weights (94%/6%), demonstrating conceptual and numeric application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit code excerpts, stepwise verification, or a clear statement of personal execution/debugging, so the technical demonstration is incomplete and warrants PARTIAL.",
