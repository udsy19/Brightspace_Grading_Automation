  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components and calculation—market-value weights, CAPM-based cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, computed firm WACC, and sensitivity to incremental debt—plus peer comparisons and project vs firm rate discussion. Minor input inconsistencies exist, but the depth and multiple applications satisfy PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies CAPM components (risk-free rate, beta, market risk premium), computes a numeric cost-of-equity, and applies it to WACC and peer comparisons—demonstrating applied, thorough understanding. Minor input inconsistencies are present but do not undermine the clear, substantive CAPM use, meeting PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student identifies pre-tax yields and the corporate tax rate, computes an after‑tax cost of debt and explicitly notes the tax-shield benefit by showing the WACC decline when debt increases. Minor numeric mismatches exist, but the submission demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and its effect on WACC, meeting PASS under the moderate standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: This is a STRICT technical criterion; although correct numeric components appear, the student explicitly relied on an AI tool and declined to show personal implementation or stepwise verification. Because they did not demonstrate ownership, code/step execution, or explicit methodological validation required by the rubric, the submission fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal implementation, stepwise methodology, and verification. Although a CAPM numeric result is presented, the student defers to Gemini, provides no executed code or detailed walkthrough, and shows input inconsistencies—therefore failing to meet required explicit demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard the student must explicitly demonstrate personal execution, stepwise methodology, and verification. While the student reports market‑value choices and resulting weights, they explicitly outsourced the work to Gemini and did not show owner‑executed steps, code, or verification—failing the requirement for explicit demonstration.",
