  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of the WACC formula and components: CAPM cost of equity with numeric inputs, after‑tax cost of debt, market value weighting, and unlevering/relevering beta when capital structure changes. They applied the method to scenarios and peers and reflected on implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM with stated inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, beta) and produced the right numeric cost of equity (11.65%). They also demonstrated deeper understanding by unlevering and relevering beta when modeling capital-structure changes and explaining the resulting effect on equity cost, satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), applied it in the WACC formula, and explicitly discussed the tax‑shield benefit when comparing Netflix to Disney and when recommending more leverage. They also modeled the capital‑structure change and its offsetting effects, demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly performed the WACC arithmetic (CAPM inputs, after‑tax debt, market weights) and produced a numeric result, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block‑by‑block code understanding, or ownership of AI‑generated code (only referenced Colab/Gemini), and there is a minor inconsistency in reported debt weight—so the submission meets PARTIAL but not PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied the CAPM formula and produced a numeric cost of equity, showing conceptual and numerical understanding. However, under the STRICT technical requirements they did not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, block‑by‑block explanation, or ownership of the AI‑generated code, so the implementation is partial rather than fully validated.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described and computed market-value weights and provided numeric results, demonstrating conceptual and arithmetic understanding. However, under the STRICT technical requirements they did not explicitly show personal execution (no shown runs, data sources, or block‑by‑block code explanation) or fully validate the market debt estimate, so the work is only PARTIAL.",

        "\"adding adding debt increases financial risk which increases the beta in cost of uh equity. So, first we must unlever the beta ... We relever the the asset beta using the new capital structure which give us a new um higher equity beta of 1 35... our WAC barely moves falling to 11 20.\"",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — defined the financing decision (WACC for $5B project). Implement — computed numeric costs and modeled issuing $3B debt (unlever/relever beta, new WACC). Reflect/Evolve — compared to peers (Disney), weighed tax‑shield benefits vs. higher equity cost, and offered an actionable recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the capital‑structure trade‑offs: quantified cheap after‑tax debt vs. expensive equity, modeled how added leverage raises equity risk and can offset debt benefits, and drew a balanced recommendation with peer comparison and numeric outcomes. This thorough, example‑driven treatment satisfies the PASS standard."
