  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM for cost of equity, computed after-tax cost of debt, derived market-value weights and WACC before and after additional debt, and produced project-specific and peer-comparison analysis. These multiple, specific calculations and the policy recommendation demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its components.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used CAPM inputs (rf = 4.5%, MRP = 5.5%, beta = 1.3) to compute cost of equity = 4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%, implemented this in code, and applied the same method to project-specific betas (1.1 and 1.5), demonstrating both correct calculation and applied understanding. These concrete calculations plus interpretation satisfy a thorough treatment of the CAPM cost-of-equity criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed a specific after-tax cost of debt (4.58%), explained the tax-shield concept, implemented it in scenario analysis (showing WACC declines after adding debt), and used peer comparisons to illustrate the benefit. These concrete calculations plus conceptual discussion demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of after-tax cost of debt and the tax-shield benefit.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed all WACC components and produced numeric WACC results, showing planned methodology and code execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, detailed verification steps, or clear ownership statements (beyond saying they used Colab and that \"Collab validated\" results), so the implementation is correct but lacks the explicit, defended technical demonstration required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM inputs and produced the expected cost-of-equity value and integrated it into analysis, showing functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block code explanation, detailed verification steps, or clear ownership statements about running and validating the code (e.g., no walkthrough of functions/lines or \"I ran and inspected X output\"), so the submission demonstrates correct implementation but lacks the explicit technical demonstration required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market-value inputs (market cap and debt) and produced explicit weight percentages, indicating correct conceptual use of market-value weights. However, under the STRICT technical requirement they did not show explicit block‑by‑block code walkthrough, detailed verification steps, or clear ownership/inspection of outputs (only stated they used Colab and that it \"validated\" results), and there are small inconsistencies in the transcripted numbers — so the implementation is correct but lacks the explicit, demonstrated technical detail needed for a full PASS.",
