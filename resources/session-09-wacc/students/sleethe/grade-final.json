  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly cross-checked portfolio results against a named industry benchmark (S&P 500) and reported comparative metrics (returns and risk), fulfilling the external validation requirement. This satisfies the moderate-standard expectation for Validate.\n- Clear Communication and Explanation: The video transcript shows a well-organized flow (intro, data representation, implementation, validation, simulation, and reflection), clear explanations of methodology and outcomes, and a concise conclusion highlighting the recommended portfolio. Despite minor verbal disfluencies, the presenter demonstrated understanding and effective communication of the analysis.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript shows a focused portfolio risk/return analysis across the DRIVER stages but contains no mention or explanation of WACC or its components. Because the criterion (WACC formula and components) is entirely missing, the appropriate score is FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission covers portfolio returns, risk, and efficient frontier across DRIVER stages but contains no mention or explanation of the CAPM formula or components needed to calculate cost of equity. Because the required CAPM discussion/calculation is missing, the correct score is FAIL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission focuses on portfolio returns, risk, and efficient frontier but contains no mention or calculation of cost of debt or the after-tax tax shield. Because the required concept is entirely missing from the DRIVER stages, the appropriate score is FAIL.",
