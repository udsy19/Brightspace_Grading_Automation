  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of WACC formula and components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights, unlever/relever beta) and applies them with numeric examples and scenario analysis. The implement and validate stages show correct calculation, sensitivity checks, and interpretation, meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains CAPM components, supplies numeric inputs, implements the CAPM in code, and shows applied results (11.65% base cost of equity and a higher equity beta/cost after added debt). Combined conceptual explanation, numeric calculation, scenario application, and validation meet the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-deductibility of interest, defines and implements the after‑tax cost-of-debt, provides the numeric calculation (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), and demonstrates the tax-shield effect in scenario and sensitivity analysis. This combination of conceptual explanation, numeric application, and validation meets the standards for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented WACC components, produced numeric outputs, and described validation checks and sensitivity analysis, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution/ownership (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\") nor provide block‑by‑block explanations of functions, so full PASS requirements are not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes CAPM, lists inputs and the notebook functions, and reports a numeric CAPM result (11.65%) with validation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide explicit personal execution language or block‑by‑block walkthrough (e.g., \"I ran this cell and this function returns X; this function calculates Y\"), so full PASS requirements are not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student collected appropriate market-value inputs and reported numeric capital-structure weights, showing correct methodology in principle. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution or provide a block‑by‑block walkthrough (e.g., \"I ran these cells and this function returns X\"), so full PASS requirements are not satisfied.",
