You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM and after‑tax cost of debt, used market-value weights, produced internally consistent WACC calculations, and demonstrated sensitivity to added debt. The treatment is detailed, validated, and includes application and implications, meeting the threshold for a thorough (PASS) evaluation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly selected and documented CAPM inputs, applied the formula with accurate arithmetic (4.5% + 1.3*5.5% = 11.65%), and validated the result—showing a clear, applied understanding of cost of equity. The treatment is specific, integrated into the WACC calculation, and sufficiently thorough for a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly used the bond yield and statutory tax rate to compute after‑tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−0.21)=4.58%), explicitly noted the tax shield benefit, and applied/validated this input within the WACC and leverage sensitivity—demonstrating thorough and accurate treatment.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly computed and reported all WACC components (cost of equity via CAPM, after‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weights) and applied them to produce consistent WACC figures and a leverage sensitivity. However, under this STRICT technical category the submission lacks explicit technical‑implementation artifacts (no code/spreadsheet snapshots, no \"I ran this code\" or block‑by‑block execution/ownership statements), so it demonstrates correct results but not the required explicit technical execution—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM, showed the inputs and arithmetic, and validated the result—demonstrating conceptual and numerical correctness. However, under this STRICT technical category they did not provide explicit technical implementation artifacts (code/spreadsheet, \"I ran this code\", or block‑by‑block execution/ownership statements), so while the CAPM work is correct, the required explicit technical execution evidence is missing.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used and reported market values for equity and debt and computed weights accordingly, demonstrating correct conceptual handling. However, under the STRICT technical requirement they did not provide explicit implementation artifacts or a step‑by‑step method for deriving market‑value debt (no code/spreadsheet snapshots or detailed procedural ownership), so the evidence is correct but lacks the required technical explicitness—hence PARTIAL.",

        "\"My final recommendation is that Netflix should increase leverage gradually toward a target of 10–15% debt... This moderate increase in debt would support large-scale content investments, enhance returns to shareholders, and improve Netflix's competitive position...\""

      "driver_alignment": "DISCOVER (framed WACC as the investment hurdle and gathered inputs); EXECUTE/REPRESENT (quantified WACC impact of additional debt and built a sensitivity visualization); EVOLVE (translated trade-offs into a concrete gradual‑leverage recommendation balancing lower WACC and financial risk).",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the trade‑offs: debt lowers WACC via a cheaper cost and tax shield but excessive leverage raises risk and WACC, shown numerically and via sensitivity. The recommendation to increase leverage gradually to 10–15% ties the analysis to practical risk/return considerations, demonstrating a logical, well‑argued presentation."
