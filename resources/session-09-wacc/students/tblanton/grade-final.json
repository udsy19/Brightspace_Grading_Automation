  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM cost-of-equity, the after‑tax cost-of-debt formula, and the market-value weighted WACC, then applied them with numeric inputs and a debt-issue scenario. They demonstrated conceptual understanding, concrete calculation, and validation—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM formula, supplied and documented numeric inputs (Rf=4.5, MRP=5.5, beta=1.3), implemented the computation in code, and reported the resulting cost of equity (11.65%) with interpretation. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding satisfying the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the after‑tax cost‑of‑debt formula, implemented it in code, and demonstrated the tax‑shield benefit through a debt‑issuance scenario that lowered WACC. This applied explanation plus numeric scenario evidence meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported all WACC components and numerical results and indicated they automated the calculation, which shows partial technical execution. But under the STRICT technical standard they did not demonstrate explicit, block‑level understanding of the code, stepwise verification, or ownership details (no walkthrough of functions/logic or artifacts), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly described CAPM, provided inputs, automated the computation, and reported the resulting cost of equity, showing functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not present block‑by‑block code explanation, explicit evidence of running/verifying the code, or ownership details required for a PASS, so the submission earns PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly chose and reported market-value inputs and automated weight calculations, showing partial technical execution. Under the STRICT criterion, they failed to provide explicit code walkthrough, verification statements, or detailed methodological artifacts, so the submission cannot reach PASS.",
