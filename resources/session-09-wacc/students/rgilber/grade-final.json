Although high-level, the presentation demonstrates effective communication and understanding appropriate for this moderate criterion, meriting a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains only high-level methodological statements and no mention of WACC formula, its components, or any numeric/examples applying it. Given the complete absence of WACC-related content, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains only high-level methodology and no discussion or application of CAPM components or formula (no beta, risk-free rate, market premium, or numeric example). Because the required Cost of Equity (CAPM) concept is entirely missing, the submission fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The transcript contains only high-level methodological statements and dataset-level findings with no discussion or calculation of cost of debt, after-tax adjustments, or tax-shield effects.
