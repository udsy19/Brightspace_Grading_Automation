  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula components (CAPM for Ke, after-tax Kd, market-value weights and tax shield), provides numeric inputs and calculated results (Ke = 11.65%, WACC = 11.22%), and implements them in code with scenario analysis and strategic interpretation. This constitutes a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM, provides explicit input values (Rf, MRP, beta) and computes Ke = 11.65%, then uses it in scenario analysis and code implementation. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of the cost-of-equity calculation consistent with PASS standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly explains the tax-shield concept, provides numeric inputs (bond yield and 21% tax rate), and implements the after-tax cost of debt in a Python calculation and scenario that alters WACC. This shows a correct, applied, and sufficiently detailed treatment meeting PASS standards.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports running code and provides numeric WACC results, they did not present the actual code, stepwise function explanations, or explicit verification/ownership required by this STRICT technical criterion. The submission lacks the block-by-block demonstration and explicit validation needed to pass.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and computes CAPM with explicit inputs and a numeric result, showing conceptual and arithmetic correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they failed to provide the actual code, block-by-block explanation, or explicit evidence of having executed and verified the implementation, so the submission is only a partial technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student reports inputs and final weight percentages, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, provide the code or block-level explanation, or show verification steps required by this STRICT criterion. Because the submission lacks the required explicit technical evidence of how market-value weights were determined and validated, it fails the criterion.",

      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, balanced logic of capital-structure trade-offs: benefits of debt (tax shield, lower WACC) versus costs (higher financial risk raising Ke and Kd), illustrates the U-shaped WACC concept, and supports it with peer comparison and a financing recommendation—constituting a thorough and logical presentation."
