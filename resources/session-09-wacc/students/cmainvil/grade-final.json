  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula, computes CAPM and a numeric WACC (11.22%), verifies the calculation, and extends analysis with sensitivity, tax-shield, project-specific rates, and peer comparison—demonstrating depth and applied understanding. DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) further show they both executed the calculation and understood its implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, computed a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), verified/used it in subsequent WACC calculations, and applied the concept to project-specific risk (adjusted beta). These show a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly identifies and uses the after-tax cost of debt, explains the tax-shield mechanism in detail, and applies it in a concrete leverage scenario that changes WACC. Combined execution (Implement) and reflection on implications demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported numeric CAPM and WACC results, described the components (cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), and ran/verified scenario analyses—showing practical execution. However, they did not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit stepwise verification details, or full ownership-level technical documentation required under the strict rubric, so the work merits PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed and reported a numeric CAPM (11.65%) and indicates they ran code and verified results, demonstrating functional implementation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit ownership of the code (detailed steps/functions), or technical documentation—plus they relied on an AI assistant—so the evidence supports only PARTIAL credit.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly used market values (equity market cap and debt market value) and incorporated them into the calculation flow, demonstrating correct conceptual determination of weights. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block-by-block code explanation, explicit run/verification logs, or detailed ownership of the implementation, so the evidence supports only PARTIAL credit.",
