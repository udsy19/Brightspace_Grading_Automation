  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the WACC formula and cost-of-equity inputs, computes current and post-debt WACC with numeric results, and explains the after-tax debt (tax shield) effect—demonstrating thorough, applied understanding. Implementation and reflection evidence (code validation and interpretation) support a full mastery of the criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM approach (beta and market risk premium), applies it to produce a numeric cost of equity (11.65%), and uses that figure in WACC calculations validated by code. Combined discovery, implementation, and reflection show a thorough, applied understanding of cost-of-equity via CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after-tax cost-of-debt adjustment (1 − tax rate), computes a numeric after-tax RD (4.852%), and shows the resulting WACC change with interpretation of the tax-shield benefit. Implementation and reflection evidence demonstrate applied understanding beyond a brief mention, satisfying the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies the WACC formula, computes numeric WACCs, and verifies results—demonstrating personal execution and validation. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not show block‑by‑block code explanation, ownership of specific functions/steps, or detailed methodological artifacts (code snippets, walkthroughs), so the implementation is credible but not demonstrated at the required explicit level for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly describes and applies CAPM inputs and reports a numeric cost-of-equity and verification via code, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not provide block‑by‑block code explanation or detailed ownership of the CAPM implementation, so the evidence meets partial but not full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly uses market-value weights and reports specific equity and debt market values and a validated numeric outcome, showing partial technical execution. However, under the STRICT standard they do not provide block‑by‑block code, explicit methodology for how debt market value was determined, or a detailed walkthrough of the weighting calculation, so the implementation is credible but not demonstrated at the level required for a full PASS.",

      "reasoning": "The student clearly presents the trade‑off logic (tax shield versus financial distress), quantifies the WACC effect from additional debt, and links that to a recommendation for adjusting capital structure with peer comparison—demonstrating a logical, applied presentation of capital-structure trade‑offs."
