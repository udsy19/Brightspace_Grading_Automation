  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed WACC with explicit component values (market weights, CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt), showed before/after issuance calculations, and applied this to project and peer comparisons, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding of the WACC formula and its drivers. The analysis, numerical examples, and recommendation indicate strong mastery rather than a superficial mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly listed CAPM inputs and produced consistent cost-of-equity calculations (e.g., 11.65% from 4.5% + 1.3*5.5%), applied them in multiple examples (US vs international), and implemented the computation in code. This demonstrates a thorough, correct application of CAPM beyond a superficial mention.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an after-tax cost of debt consistent with the provided bond yield and tax rate (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.5%), used it in WACC calculations, and explicitly discussed the tax-shield implication and its effect on WACC with numerical before/after examples. This demonstrates a thorough, correct application of after-tax cost of debt and the tax benefit.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student produced WACC outputs and described a plan, the submission lacks the STRICT required explicit technical evidence: no statement of personally running and verifying the code, no block-by-block explanation of the implementation, and no demonstrable ownership or detailed validation steps. Under the strict technical standard, this is insufficient.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the correct CAPM inputs and numeric outputs appear, the submission fails the strict technical standard: there is no explicit statement of personally running and verifying the code, no block-by-block explanation of the CAPM implementation, and no clear ownership/defense of the code. Under the strict rubric, these missing explicit technical artifacts require a FAIL.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student used and reported market-value inputs and resulting weights, the submission lacks the strict technical artifacts required: no explicit statement of personally running and verifying the code, no block-by-block explanation of how weights were computed, and no demonstrated ownership/validation of implementation. Under the strict rubric these missing explicit technical evidences require a FAIL.",

      "reasoning": "The student correctly identifies key trade-offs (debt weight, tax shield, impact on beta/WACC) and applies numeric examples to support a financing recommendation. However the discussion is one‑sided and shallow—it omits meaningful countervailing costs (distress risk, rating/covenant impacts, rising marginal cost of debt) and lacks a structured approach to finding an optimal leverage point, so the treatment is correct but incomplete."
