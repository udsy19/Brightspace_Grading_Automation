  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies WACC, reports the key components (cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market value weights) and computes current and new WACC values, showing technical competence (Implement). They also reflect on appropriate application (project-specific discounting) and strategic implications, meeting the moderate standard for thorough conceptual understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student calculated WACC values and explicitly addressed using WACC as a hurdle rate, noting it should be adjusted by project risk rather than applied universally. This demonstrates applied understanding and appropriate decision-making guidance, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student clearly defined the problem and scope, enumerated the necessary inputs for the cost-of-capital calculation, and linked the analysis to a specific financing decision (increase debt ratio). This explicit framing satisfies the Define & Discover requirement.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student produced a concrete cost-of-equity value and used it in the WACC calculation (Implement), showing understanding that equity cost is required. However, there is no explicit CAPM formula, inputs (beta, risk-free rate, market premium), or discussion of how the equity cost was derived, so the treatment is correct but basic.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student reports a clear after-tax cost-of-debt value and used debt/corporate tax inputs in the WACC calculation, showing basic correct application of the tax shield. However, they do not show the pre-tax cost, the tax rate or the formula (rd*(1–Tc)) or discuss the tax-shield mechanics, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student computed and reported an after-tax cost of debt and included corporate tax as an input, indicating basic application of the tax shield. However, they did not show the tax-shield formula (rd*(1–Tc)), pre-tax cost or explain how interest deductibility reduces effective cost, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
