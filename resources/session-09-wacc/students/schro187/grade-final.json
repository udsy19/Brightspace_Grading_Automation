  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the cost-of-capital problem (project size, debt scenario, peer comparison) and interprets the WACC as the investment hurdle (11.22%), satisfying the Define & Discover requirement. Evidence shows clear, specific identification of objectives and key inputs, meeting the STRICT expectation for explicit demonstration.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly links WACC to capital‑budgeting (stating the project must exceed the 11.22% hurdle) and uses peer comparisons to inform valuation/financing context, demonstrating clear recognition of WACC applications. Evidence shows applied understanding beyond mere definition, satisfying the criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states key WACC components (cost of equity formula, after‑tax cost of debt, and weighting) and produces numeric WACC results using code, showing understanding of the concept. However the treatment is not fully thorough or rigorously explained (some reliance on copied code and a brief/confused description of the weighting), so the demonstration is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula and reports a computed cost of equity (evidence of conceptual and applied understanding). However, the treatment is brief and relies on copied/generated code with limited explanation of inputs, assumptions, or sensitivity, so the demonstration is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly reports the headline cost of debt and its after‑tax adjustment (showing awareness of the tax shield), and produced numeric results via implemented code. However, the treatment is brief and relies on copied code with minimal explanation of the tax shield's mechanics or assumptions, so the demonstration is correct but not thorough enough for a PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: Student clearly frames the task (project size and objective).\n- Implement: Student narrates running code and reporting numeric results (cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, WACC).\n- Reflect: Student comments on struggles, requests clearer visuals, and interprets the WACC as a hurdle rate.",
      "reasoning": "The video communicates the key concepts and outputs (CAPM formula, after‑tax cost of debt, WACC and the 11.22% hurdle) showing understanding, but presentation is informal and lacks depth, structured visuals, and thorough explanation of inputs/assumptions. Because it is correct but incomplete and somewhat disorganized, it meets the criterion partially rather than fully."
