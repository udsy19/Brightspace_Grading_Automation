  "transcript": "Okay, so for the assignment, we are given a hypothetical $5 billion investment, and we need to calculate the weighted average cost of capital for Netflix, kind of the impact of additional debt financing, I think it's, yeah, $3 billion down here, and then kind of firm-wide discount rates, and then comparing Netflix's cost of capital to industry peers, so you're given all this information here, it's kind of a lot to digest, just looking at it on the surface level, so I started by just copy and pasting this assignment into Gemini, asking it for some code, and I got working code. I got working code on my first try, I got a nice cost of equity right here, I got the current weighted average capital cost here, and you can kind of see it gives you that equity divided by debt rate right here, and then we get this new weighted average cost of capital after that $3 billion, I guess, debt from, I guess, just from an investment for that content, you get a little bit lower of a weighted average cost of capital right there, it kind of gives you the change in that number here, and then you get a peer comparison of Netflix weighted average cost of capital, higher than Amazon and Disney, two pretty substantial companies here, and then, yeah, so it says for the $5 billion content investment, returns must exceed 11.22%, so again, this weighted average capital cost is the average rate a company expects to pay to finance its assets, basically, so obviously, if this is the rate that it costs to actually, I guess, invest, or yeah, finance its assets, it of course needs to be exceeding this number, or else it would just be stupid, you wouldn't do it in the first place, so you need to at least be exceeding this number to kind of generate a profit, so I was given a lot of numbers here, but I wanted a little bit more explanations on kind of the calculations, maybe like a bar graph, a chart, something that would help me kind of, I guess, digest these numbers a little bit more, so I struggled a little bit with getting that, but I was able to eventually, so you can kind of see, I'd like you to adjust the code, didn't get working code, the code's not running, it's just the same kind of thing, took me a while just playing around with it, and then this is the one that did work when I just had to include an explanation of the weighted average cost in Python code that I can run in Colab, so then I did get some working code, and again, we're met with kind of the same numbers from above, but we get a calculation here, so the cost of equity is the risk-free rate plus equity beta times the market risk premium here, so that's shown, and then investors demand this 11.65% return to hold a Netflix stock, you get the formula, which I just read off, and then you can see that our equity beta rates here, our risk-free rate, and then our market risk premium, so these are kind of the numbers that this is plucking from, you get the cost of debt, you have this 5.8% headline, and then of course you have to take into tax, that kind of bumps that down to 4.58%, and then again, we have this capital structure, so again, to get that rate, this weighted average cost of capital, this 11.22, you're just dividing, yeah, you're dividing this equity divided by debt, I don't know why it didn't include it down here, but it was included in the first one, so it's kind of saying Netflix, Netflix is barely using debt compared to other companies, and you can kind of see that this graph here was helpful of the cost of debt, so very cheap here, you can see it's much lower than these, and then this weighted average cost of capital is kind of average, and then the cost of equity, a little bit more on the expensive side, so I think those numbers kind of helped me break it down a little bit more, and kind of understand, yeah, this weighted average cost of capital, it really needs to be, you really need to be getting a return that's greater than this rate for it to be worth it, because again, that's kind of what you're expending to actually invest and further the company, in this case, this $5 billion content deal, or the additional $3 billion that was kind of part of this problem too, so yeah, when you're comparing it to Amazon and Disney, some of these other giants, they're expecting a little bit higher of a rate to pay to finance these assets, which I thought was interesting, I think that it would be, these are definitely beneficial to compare Netflix to, but I think it would be beneficial to look at other big companies, Apple, Tesla, just kind of get an idea of what this average, kind of weighted average cost of capital rate is, and then additionally maybe to streaming services like Hulu, HBO, et cetera, just kind of where do these other streaming services stack up with how much they're paying to kind of finance their assets, so I think that would give you kind of an even better gauge maybe of where Netflix is at, even though these are helpful metrics to look at, and I think again, just this assignment was a little bit harder, just because the code was just not cooperating with me, it took a while for me to get working code for this one specifically, so I just had to be patient with it, kind of change the wording a little bit, and eventually I did get it, and then yeah, you get a good explanation, so again, I think this class is just kind of preparing us, and these assignments are preparing us kind of with tools that we can use for ourselves, I think that's gonna be the most applicable thing, is for ourselves, looking to invest, obviously it can't just tell you, this is the best investment, you need to invest this amount at this time, it can't do that of course, but it can provide you with tools, and can provide you with analysis, which will kind of allow you to make an informed decision on, I guess a company's financial health, yeah, so I'd say that was probably my biggest takeaway from this one.",
