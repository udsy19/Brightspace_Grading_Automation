You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly stated the WACC formula and its components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, capital weights), implemented the calculations with numeric outputs and scenario analysis, and reflected on validation and implications. Coverage is thorough and applied (including project-specific betas and sensitivity), meeting the standards for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly stated and applied the CAPM formula (RF + beta*MRP), implemented it in code with the provided inputs, and validated results in the reflection stage. They also used project-specific beta adjustments and discussed implications, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly used the after-tax debt formula (×(1–T)), implemented it with the provided yield and tax inputs in code, and showed the WACC decline after adding debt while discussing the tax-shield benefit and attendant risk tradeoffs. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented the WACC components and produced numerical outputs, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide the required explicit block-by-block code explanation, stepwise verification statements (e.g., \"I ran and tested function X, which does Y\"), or detailed ownership of each implementation element—so the work is correct in part but lacks the explicit, verifiable technical exposition needed for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly stated and implemented CAPM (RF + beta*MRP) and produced numeric outputs in a Colab notebook, demonstrating functional application. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide explicit block-by-block explanations, test/verification statements (e.g., \"I ran and validated function X\"), or detailed ownership of each code component—so the implementation is correct but lacks the explicit, verifiable technical exposition required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided the correct market-value inputs and said they implemented capital-structure weights in code and used them in scenario analysis, showing partial technical execution. However, under the strict standard they did not provide explicit block‑by‑block code explanation, stepwise verification of the weight calculations, or clear ownership statements (e.g., showing the exact weight formulas and outputs), so the evidence is incomplete for a full PASS.",
