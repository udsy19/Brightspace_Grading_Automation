  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and used key WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights, tax shield effects), computed current and post-issuance WACC, and applied these to project-specific guidance and peer comparison. Coverage is detailed and applied across stages (calculation, validation, and strategic recommendation), meeting the threshold for a thorough conceptual treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only computed company and post-issuance WACCs but explicitly derived and applied project-specific hurdle rates, recommended funding and leverage strategies for the $5B investment, and noted when firm-wide WACC is inappropriate (international projects). This applied, contextual use of WACC for investment decision-making is thorough and meets the PASS standard.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student explicitly reported automating WACC computations via Python/Colab, described what the code produces (cost components, capital structure, multiple WACCs), and tied those outputs to analysis and recommendations. Under the MODERATE standard, this constitutes a clear, applied automation of the WACC workflow, meriting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied CAPM, supplied the key inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, beta), and integrated the output into WACC and project analyses, demonstrating functional understanding. However, the treatment is basic — the transcript lacks an explicit cost-of-equity numeric result, sensitivity discussion, or deeper explanation of assumptions, so it falls short of the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified pre-tax debt, included the corporate tax rate, implemented after-tax cost-of-debt computation in code, and applied the tax-shield logic to recommend more leverage. However, treatment is basic: the transcript does not show the explicit after-tax cost calculation result, sensitivity analysis, or deeper discussion of assumptions/limits, so it meets partial (correct but limited) standards.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified interest deductibility (tax rate), implemented after-tax cost-of-debt in their calculations, and used the tax-shield concept to justify higher leverage. However, the treatment is high-level and lacks explicit quantification or sensitivity analysis of the tax-shield magnitude and its impact, so it meets a correct but limited (PARTIAL) standard.",
