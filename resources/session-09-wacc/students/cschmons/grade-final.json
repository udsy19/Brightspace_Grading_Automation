  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission demonstrates a clear, applied understanding of WACC components (definition, market-value weights, cost of equity via beta, after-tax cost of debt) and produces baseline and scenario WACC figures with interpretation of implications, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computes the after-tax cost of debt using a stated corporate tax rate, applies that result to a financing scenario that alters WACC, and discusses the tax-shield benefit versus peers—demonstrating both correct mechanics and meaningful interpretation. This applied, multi-part treatment meets the thoroughness required for PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly calculates the after-tax cost of debt using a stated corporate tax rate and applies that result to WACC scenarios, showing mechanical correctness. They also interpret the tax-shield's strategic impact versus peers, demonstrating both application and meaningful reflection, meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies beta-driven higher equity returns and reports a specific cost of equity and its use in WACC, demonstrating understanding. However, they do not show the CAPM formula or the underlying inputs (risk-free rate, market risk premium) or derivation, so the treatment is correct but basic—meeting PARTIAL under the moderate standard.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard, the student must explicitly demonstrate execution and stepwise calculation of WACC (weights, CAPM inputs, formula, and arithmetic or code verification). The transcript only reports inputs and final outputs without showing the formula application, intermediary math, or ownership of computation, so it fails to meet the required explicit demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: Under the STRICT technical standard, the student must explicitly demonstrate CAPM implementation (formula, inputs, stepwise calculation or runnable code and verification). The transcript only reports a beta and a final percentage and indicates AI assistance, without showing the CAPM formula, the risk-free rate or market premium used, the arithmetic, or evidence of having run/verified the calculation—therefore it fails.",

        "\"the goal here is to state the main objective, which is to calculate the current, um, weighted average cost of capital and analyze the impact of 30 billion dollars of debt and compare to peers like Disney.\"",
        "\"the weighted average cost of capital definition is the minimum return a company must earn on its existing asset base to satisfy all of its capital providers, equity and debt holders. It's the hurdle rate for new investments.\"",
        "\"The proposed 3 billion debt financing is a good first step, lowering WACC to 11.13%.\""
      ],
      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: student clearly frames the problem and objective (calculate WACC and evaluate financing).\n- Represent/Implement: student explains WACC components and reports component values (market-cap, debt, beta, pre/post-tax debt) and a computed baseline.\n- Reflect/Evolve: student interprets results and gives actionable recommendations (3B financing step, target 15–20% leverage, project-specific hurdle rates).",
      "reasoning": "The presentation is structured and communicative: it defines WACC, walks through component logic with specific numbers, presents scenario outcomes, and draws clear recommendations—demonstrating effective explanation and application suitable for a PASS."
