You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weights), computes numeric WACC values, runs sensitivity and re‑leveraging analysis, and validates results by hand—demonstrating thorough, practical understanding beyond a basic description.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified CAPM inputs, computed a plausible cost of equity (11.65%), applied it in analysis, and validated the result by hand and sensitivity checks. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM consistent with the DRIVER stages.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after‑tax cost of debt using the bond yield and tax rate (5.8%*(1−0.21)=4.58%), integrated it into WACC, and explicitly linked increased leverage to tax‑shield benefits in recommendations—demonstrating accurate calculation and applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced correct WACC component outputs and validated them by hand, showing partial technical ownership. However, they did not provide or explain the code block-by-block, nor explicitly demonstrate running/debugging the script or detailed component implementation as required by the STRICT technical standard—hence PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student produced a correct CAPM result and validated it by hand, showing partial technical ownership. They did not, however, demonstrate the required strict technical implementation evidence (explicit personal execution and block‑by‑block code explanation), so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values to compute capital‑structure weights (reported 93.9%) and validated results by hand, showing correct determination of weights. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation or explicit evidence of personally running/debugging the script, so the submission is only PARTIAL.",
