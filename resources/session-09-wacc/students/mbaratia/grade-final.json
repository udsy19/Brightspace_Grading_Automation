  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identified and applied WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, pre/post‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weights) and produced coherent pre/post issuance WACC calculations and project‑specific examples. They also interpreted implications (tax shield, peer comparisons), demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student provided the CAPM inputs (Rf, beta, MRP), produced the correct numeric cost of equity (11.65% matches 4.5% + 1.3×5.5%), and applied it within the WACC and peer-comparison analysis. They also interpreted the role of beta and business risk, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed after‑tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−21%) ≈ 4.58%) and applied it in the WACC calculations, and explicitly discussed the tax‑deductibility/tax‑shield benefit and its trade‑off with financial risk. This shows accurate calculation plus applied interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided the necessary WACC components and produced plausible numeric results (cost of equity 11.65% consistent with 4.5% + 1.3×5.5%, after‑tax cost of debt 4.58% from 5.8% with 21% tax). However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit step‑by‑step calculations, verification steps, code/run evidence, or a block‑by‑block methodology that demonstrates personal execution and reproducibility—so the work is correct but lacks the explicit technical demonstration required for a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided correct CAPM inputs and a cost‑of‑equity result consistent with CAPM (4.5% + 1.3×5.5% = 11.65%), showing conceptual and numerical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate step‑by‑step calculation, code/run verification, or personal execution/ownership of the implementation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student provided market‑value inputs (market cap and debt) and reported the resulting weights (including updated weights after issuance), demonstrating correct numerical application. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit weight calculations, step‑by‑step methodology, or verification (no formulas, code runs, or worked arithmetic), so the implementation is correct but lacks the required explicit demonstration for a full PASS.",
