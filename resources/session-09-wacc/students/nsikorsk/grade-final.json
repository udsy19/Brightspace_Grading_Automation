  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately stated the WACC formula, computed its components (CAPM cost of equity, market-value weights, after-tax cost of debt) with numeric examples and applied them to scenarios (debt issuance, project evaluation). They also demonstrated deeper understanding by discussing relevering beta (Hamada) and credit-rating implications, satisfying the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the CAPM formula, computed a numeric cost-of-equity (used in WACC), and applied it to project evaluation, demonstrating practical application (Implement). They also discussed advanced adjustments (Hamada) and project-specific beta implications (Reflect/Evolve), providing the depth required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly included the after-tax adjustment (1 − Tc) in the WACC formula, computed a numeric after-tax cost of debt, and applied it in WACC calculations (Implement). They also analyzed the tax-shield benefit and its limits, recommending leveraging to capture tax shields while noting credit-rating tradeoffs (Reflect/Evolve), providing the depth and application needed for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market-value weights (E/V and D/V), provided numeric firm values and updated them for a debt issuance, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, they did not explicitly show how market equity or market debt values were derived (e.g., shares × price, market value of debt estimation) nor provide step-by-step verification or ownership of calculations, so the treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed a clear scenario sensitivity for capital structure (the $3B debt issuance) and discussed how beta/project risk would change discounting, showing correct conceptual sensitivity. However, they did not present a systematic, multi-input sensitivity analysis (no parameter tables, ranges, or stepwise results for multiple key inputs like MRP, Rf, beta ranges or debt levels), nor explicit verification steps—so the work is correct but incomplete for a strict PASS.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The student clearly documents the driver workflow and manual calculation steps, but there is no explicit evidence of automation (no mention of spreadsheets, code, scripts, tools, or that they executed and verified automated routines). Phrases like \"punch it into the calculation\" imply manual entry rather than an automated process, so the criterion for automation is not met.",
