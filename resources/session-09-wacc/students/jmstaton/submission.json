  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Jacob Staton and this is the session nine assignment. So in session 9, we are newly appointed the chief financial officer at Forward Tech and the CEO presents three major strategic initiatives each requiring a $100 million investment. So the first one is project alpha which is an AI research lab that promises 15% annual returns. The next one is project beta which is a manufacturing expansion which promises roughly 12% projected returns. And finally we have project gamma which is an international expansion targeting 9% returns. So it says that overall we have the pick although we get to pick two of them. So which one should we pick? So in terms of priority I would prioritize project alpha because it has a 15% uh projected annual return as the first interest. Secondly, I would do Project Beta with its 12% annual return. And Project Gamble would be in last place with a projected annual return of only 9%. And just to break it down a little bit more. Um, some considerations I thought through were just overall risk. Like the higher returns obviously will come with a higher risk. That's just part of anything financial that we need to evaluate the risk profile of each potential investment that we make and as well as the strategic fit because how long or like how well does it does each of these three projects align with our long-term strategic goals? And of course, you got to factor in the liquidity and payback period. Which would just be considering the time it takes to recover the initial investment for each project.",
