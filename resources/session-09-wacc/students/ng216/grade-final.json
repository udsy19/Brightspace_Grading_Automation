      "reasoning": "The student explicitly presents the trade‑offs—tax shield versus higher equity cost—quantifies them with scenario/sensitivity analysis (leverage sweep, +$3B case), and draws practical recommendations (20–30% target debt, divisional WACCs). Multiple numeric examples, plotted results, and a clear strategic conclusion show a logically organized, thorough presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs."

      "reasoning": "The presentation is well‑structured and verbalizes the decision context, methodology, and results; the student references organized tables, numeric examples and plotted visuals, and draws clear strategic conclusions. That combination of clear framing, stepwise walkthrough, and illustrative outputs meets the standard for an effective video presentation."
