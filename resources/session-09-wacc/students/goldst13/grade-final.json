  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding of WACC components—cost of equity via CAPM, cost of debt, tax deductibility, and capital-structure weights—and shows numerical application (WACC change, debt ratios) plus strategic implications. Given the moderate standard accepts conceptual treatment and the submission includes calculations, examples, and interpretation, this meets the PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student not only defines WACC as the firm's hurdle rate but shows depth by calculating numeric WACC, explaining why a single firm-wide WACC is inappropriate for all projects, and recommending divisional/risk-adjusted rates with implications—meeting the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the cost-of-capital problem, states the specific Netflix financing scenario, and provides a clear definition of WACC as the project's hurdle rate. Those explicit statements satisfy the Define & Discover requirement under the DRIVER framework.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually and produced a numeric cost-of-equity, demonstrating implementation and interpretation. However, they did not provide the CAPM inputs (risk-free rate, beta, market premium) or show the calculation steps, so the treatment is correct but basic rather than thorough.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-shield concept and shows the WACC impact of added debt, demonstrating conceptual understanding and application. However, they did not present the actual cost-of-debt rate, corporate tax rate, or an explicit after-tax cost-of-debt calculation, so treatment is correct but incomplete.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and interprets the tax-shield concept and links it to a measurable WACC reduction, showing conceptual application. However, they did not show an explicit after-tax cost-of-debt calculation (no tax rate or numeric after-tax cost), so the treatment is correct but incomplete.",
