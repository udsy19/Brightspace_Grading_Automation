  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly presents WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weights), computes numerical WACC results, runs sensitivity and competitor comparisons, and draws capital‑structure implications. These elements constitute a comprehensive, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM (rf + beta·MRP) to compute cost of equity (11.65%) and demonstrates additional, consistent examples for project-specific betas (11.10% and 12.75%). Use of hand calculation, Python validation, and explicit reflection on assumptions shows thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), demonstrates the tax‑shield impact numerically (WACC declines with more debt, explicit examples including +$3B and sensitivity to 20% debt), and validates results with code. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computes all WACC components (CAPM equity, after‑tax debt, market weights) and runs/validates Python outputs, showing partial technical execution. Because this is a STRICT criterion, the submission falls short: there is verification but no explicit, block‑by‑block code explanation or clear ownership of the implementation, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied CAPM conceptually, produced numeric results, and validated code against hand calculations, showing partial technical execution. Because this is a STRICT technical criterion and the submission lacks explicit, block‑level code explanation and full ownership of the implementation (AI‑generated code not explained line‑by‑line), the score is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used market values, computed explicit weights (200/(200+13) ≈ 93.7%, 13/213 ≈ 6.1%) and validated results with code and manual checks. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block code explanation or explicit ownership/line‑level interpretation of the implementation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",
