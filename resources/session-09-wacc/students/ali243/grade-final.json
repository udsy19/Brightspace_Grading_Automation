  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defines the problem (determine current WACC, effects of more debt, and appropriate project discount rates) and demonstrates understanding of Netflix's financing trade-offs, including a clear recommendation on debt levels. These explicit statements satisfy the strict Define & Discover requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly connects WACC to capital budgeting and valuation decisions (project spend decision, project-specific discount rates) and proposes a concrete hurdle rate for projects, demonstrating clear recognition of WACC applications. This explicit, actionable linkage satisfies the strict Evolve requirement.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student provides explicit, actionable insights on optimal capital structure (recommend increasing debt, specific debt-range targets) and recognizes trade-offs (lower cost vs. credit-risk). Those clear reflections satisfy the strict requirement for the Reflect stage.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic conceptual grasp (recognizes WACC, that debt is cheaper, and that leverage affects WACC) and provides numeric estimates and recommendations, but fails to present a clear WACC formula, component breakdown (cost of equity, explicit weights, tax-adjusted cost of debt), or coherent calculations. That level of correct but incomplete treatment fits PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The submission lacks any CAPM calculation or its components (no risk-free rate, beta, or market risk premium, and no Re = Rf + β(Rm−Rf) application). While the student conceptually discusses equity being costly and gives WACC-like percentages, the specific Cost of Equity (CAPM) calculation is missing, so it fails this criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows a basic awareness that debt has an after-tax cost and that debt can be cheaper (conceptually implying a tax benefit), and provides numeric estimates, but does not show a clear after-tax cost calculation or quantify the tax shield (no tax rate or formula applied). This correct but incomplete treatment fits PARTIAL.",
