  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a solid conceptual grasp of WACC components and drivers: reported numeric WACC values, explained the tax-shield effect of debt, contrasted debt/equity mixes and cost drivers across firms and projects, and proposed an optimal leverage range. Coverage includes multiple applied examples (project-specific WACC, Netflix vs Disney) and shows understanding beyond a brief mention, satisfying PASS under the moderate standard.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly defined the problem scope, objectives, and specific deliverables (current WACC, post‑debt WACC, project vs firm rates, peer comparison, and recommendation), meeting the strict requirement for an articulated Define & Discover stage. This clear mapping of questions and decision context justifies a PASS.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly reflected on optimal capital structure by recommending a concrete debt target range and justifying it with WACC effects (tax shield) and downside risk (bankruptcy), demonstrating considered trade-offs. The Discover stage was documented, satisfying the critical gate, and the reflection shows actionable insight, so PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student shows correct conceptual understanding of cost of equity (role of beta, diversification, higher project risk → higher required return) and produced project-specific WACC examples, but did not demonstrate an explicit CAPM calculation (no risk-free rate, market premium, or computed equity cost). Under the moderate standard this is correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax-shield concept and links increased debt to lower WACC, and discusses how credit quality affects cost of debt—showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not compute or show the after‑tax cost-of-debt formula or numeric after‑tax calculations (no kd*(1−T) application), so the treatment is correct but incomplete, meriting PARTIAL.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explains the tax‑shield concept (interest deductibility reduces effective cost of debt and lowers WACC) and applies it to the Netflix vs. Disney comparison, showing conceptual understanding. However, they did not show the quantitative after‑tax cost‑of‑debt formula or calculate the tax‑shield value, so the treatment is correct but incomplete, warranting PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "- Discover: framed the capital-structure decision and objectives for analysis.\n- Implement: compared Netflix and Disney and reported WACC impacts of changing debt levels.\n- Evolve/Reflect: weighed benefits (tax shield, lower WACC) against costs (bankruptcy risk, increased risk profile) and proposed a concrete leverage target range.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly and logically presented the trade-offs of increasing leverage—explaining the tax‑shield benefit, impact on WACC, credit‑quality differences, and downside bankruptcy risk—and applied these points to a peer comparison and a concrete recommendation. Coverage includes multiple examples and actionable guidance, meeting a thorough conceptual standard."
