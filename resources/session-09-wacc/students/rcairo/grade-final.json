  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC formula and its components (CAPM for Ke, after-tax Kd, equity/debt weights), provides numeric results, and applies the calculation to a debt-issuance scenario and peer comparison, demonstrating a thorough, integrated understanding consistent with PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states the CAPM formula, produces a specific Ke (11.65%), and applies it within the WACC and comparative analyses, showing applied and conceptual mastery. While not all input values were recited verbatim, the depth of application and reflection meets the PASS standard under a moderate evaluation.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly derives and reports the after-tax cost of debt (4.58%), shows the formula KD_pre * (1–tax), quantifies the tax-shield (0.79) and applies KD_after in the WACC calculation and scenario analysis, demonstrating thorough understanding consistent with PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly assembled formula components and reported numeric WACC and component values, showing partial technical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (block-by-block code or step verification) or full ownership of the computation, so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM equation and reports a numeric cost of equity, showing conceptual and numerical correctness. However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block implementation, or detailed verification steps (relying on \"collab\" and Gemini without showing code/validation), so the rating is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly identifies and applies the market-value weight formulas and reports numeric outcomes for the debt-issuance scenario, demonstrating conceptual and applied correctness. However, under the STRICT technical-implementation standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (code/step-by-step calculations), block-by-block verification, or ownership of the computational steps, so the rating is PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover — student framed the Netflix $5B problem and gathered parameters; Implement — student stepped through component formulas (CAPM for Ke, after-tax Kd, WE/WD) and computed a numeric WACC; Reflect — student interpreted WACC results and applied them to scenario and decision context.",
      "reasoning": "The video clearly explains the WACC methodology, presents component formulas, reports numeric results, and links outcomes to decision-making — demonstrating understanding and effective presentation. The coverage is specific and applied (scenario and implications), meeting the PASS standard."
