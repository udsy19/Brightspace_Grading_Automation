  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated and applied the WACC formula components (CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and performed consistent calculations for current and increased-leverage scenarios. They also acknowledged real-world effects on costs with leverage and drew implications, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly explained and applied the CAPM formula with specified inputs and produced the correct numeric cost of equity (11.65%), then used it in WACC calculations. They also demonstrated awareness that leverage impacts equity cost, showing a thorough, applied understanding of the CAPM cost-of-equity criterion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly described the tax-deductibility of interest, computed the after-tax cost of debt using the provided yield and tax rate, and incorporated that value into WACC calculations, demonstrating applied understanding. They also discussed the tax-shield benefit and its effect on WACC and leverage, satisfying a thorough treatment for this moderate-evaluation criterion.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student performed an explicit two-scenario sensitivity (adding $3B debt) and reported the WACC change, showing some sensitivity testing. However, they did not systematically vary multiple key inputs (beta, MRP, yield, tax rate) or demonstrate a broader sensitivity table/analysis and held costs constant, so the treatment is correct but limited.\n- Integration of Finance and Technology: The submission documents manual, step-by-step calculation but contains no evidence of automation (no code, no spreadsheet workflow, no saved model or execution description), and the strict criterion requires explicit demonstration of automation. Therefore the student fails this criterion.\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student conducted internal cross-checks between scenarios but did not reference any industry benchmarks, peer-company WACCs, calculators, databases, or external sources as required for this criterion. Because the Validate stage lacks explicit external validation, the criterion fails.",
