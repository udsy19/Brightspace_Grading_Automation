  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of WACC: they state the formula components (cost of equity via CAPM, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), validate the methodology, execute numeric calculations, and interpret implications (debt issuance effect and project-specific rates). Multiple concrete examples and computed values show strong mastery beyond a brief or superficial discussion.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a strong, specific understanding of CAPM: they state the formulaic approach, provide numerical CAPM inputs (beta, rf, MRP), validate the method, and apply adjusted betas to produce project-specific rates. These concrete inputs, validation, and application meet the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly describes the after-tax adjustment and tax shield rationale, validated the formulaic treatment, and applied it in a simulation that produced a measurable WACC reduction. These concrete inputs, validation, and applied example demonstrate a thorough, correct treatment meeting PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student reports correct components and numerical WACC outputs and says they validated formulas and ran Python—evidence of technical implementation. However, they do not provide explicit, block-by-block code explanation, show the actual implementation, or demonstrate ownership/detail required by the STRICT rubric (no function-level description or reproduced code snippets). That level of explicit demonstration is missing, so the submission is correct but incomplete for a PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies CAPM inputs and explicitly states they validated and applied CAPM and ran the code, showing partial technical implementation. However, the submission lacks strict, explicit evidence required here—no code snippets, block-by-block explanation, or clear verification steps demonstrating ownership—so it does not meet the PASS standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly lists market-value inputs (equity market cap and debt) and states they used market-value weights and executed the calculation in Python, showing correct intent and partial technical implementation. However, the submission lacks strict required evidence: no code, no block-by-block explanation of how weights were computed or verified, and no explicit ownership/verification details—so it does not meet the PASS standard.",
