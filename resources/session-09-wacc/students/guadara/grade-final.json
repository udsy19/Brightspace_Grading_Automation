You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct understanding of WACC components and formula: CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights, and numeric WACC computation with scenario analysis. They also implement, reflect on leverage effects, and apply project-specific adjustments, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, computes a numeric cost of equity, and uses it in scenario and project-specific analyses, demonstrating depth and multiple applications. Implement and Reflect stages show both calculation skill and interpretation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies the after‑tax cost of debt, uses market debt and tax rate inputs, and incorporates the tax shield concept (peer comparison and WACC impact). They also run scenario/sensitivity analysis and reflect on how changes in debt/spreads affect WACC, demonstrating thorough, applied understanding.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly includes all WACC components (cost of equity via CAPM, after‑tax cost of debt, market‑value weights) and computes numeric WACC and scenarios, so the technical calculation is essentially correct. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly show personal execution, block‑by‑block explanation of code/functions, or clear ownership of the implementation, so the submission cannot receive a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implements CAPM conceptually and shows the numeric calculation, demonstrating technical understanding. However, under the STRICT Technical Implementation requirement they did not explicitly show personal execution, block‑by‑block code explanation, or ownership of the Colab implementation, so the work is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly uses market values and computes equity/debt weights numerically, demonstrating technical correctness. Under the STRICT technical standard, however, they did not explicitly show personal code execution, block‑by‑block explanations, or ownership of the implementation, so the work is correct but lacks the required explicit technical demonstration.",

      "reasoning": "The student explicitly identifies and quantifies the trade‑off between tax‑shield benefits and increased financial risk, demonstrates it with a concrete scenario, and draws sensible strategic conclusions (cautious leverage increases and diversification). The presentation ties numerical analysis to strategic implications, meeting the standard for a logical, well‑supported discussion of capital structure trade‑offs."
