  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct application of WACC components (CAPM for cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) with numeric results for current and post-issuance WACC and analysis of implications. The DRIVER stages (Discover, Implement, Reflect) show comprehensive understanding and evaluation, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the CAPM formula, produced a specific numeric result (11.65%), and explained its interpretation in context of systematic risk and WACC impact. The DISCOVER and IMPLEMENT stages show proper input definition and execution, and the REFLECT stage demonstrates understanding of implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, used the resulting value in WACC computations, and explicitly discussed the tax-shield benefit and its trade-offs for capital structure decisions. The combined implementation and reflection demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly used all WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and produced numeric results, showing conceptual and computational steps. However, under the STRICT technical rubric they did not explicitly demonstrate personal, block-by-block code execution or ownership (they relied on Gemini/Collab without a detailed code walkthrough), so the work meets PARTIAL rather than a full PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applied the CAPM formula and reported a numeric result and high-level description of the code's inputs, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT rubric they did not provide explicit personal execution statements, block-by-block code explanation, or clear ownership of the implementation, so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student used market-value inputs and described computing weights (equity and debt) and applying them in WACC, showing partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT rubric they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\"), provide a block-by-block code walkthrough, or clearly own the implementation (repeatedly credits Gemini/Collab), and some reported weight numbers are inconsistent—so the work meets PARTIAL but not full PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover: student framed the financing decision and inputs; Implement: ran calculations for current and post‑issuance WACC to quantify effects; Reflect/Evolve: interpreted results and recommended trade‑offs (tax shield vs. higher equity/capital‑market risk), showing lessons learned and strategic guidance.",
      "reasoning": "The student clearly articulated the trade‑offs (tax shield benefits vs. increased financial risk/cost of equity and ratings risk), supported by quantified WACC outcomes and explicit recommendations (targeted leverage, financial flexibility, monitoring). The explanation is logical, linked to analysis, and provides actionable guidance, meeting PASS."

Reflect: student summarizes lessons learned and intended workflow improvements (Gemini + Colab).",
      "reasoning": "The video is organized (defines the task, lists inputs, describes methods, shows results) and the student verbally communicates the WACC methodology and numeric outcomes, plus reflection on approach—demonstrating clear understanding and effective presentation despite some verbal disfluency. These elements satisfy the PASS criteria for an effective demonstration."
