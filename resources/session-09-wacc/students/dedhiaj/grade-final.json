You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula, implements calculations (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and produces numeric results and sensitivity analysis. They further reflect on project-specific WACCs and assumptions, demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes cost of equity via CAPM with explicit inputs (rf, beta, market risk premium) and numeric result, implements it in code, and applies it to different betas for project-level analysis while acknowledging assumptions—demonstrating a thorough, applied understanding that meets PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes and applies the after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), includes it in the WACC formula, and demonstrates the tax‑shield benefit via scenario analysis and a leverage sensitivity graph, while noting real‑world caveats—meeting the thoroughness required for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student explicitly cross‑checks results against industry benchmarks and peer company WACCs and uses that comparison in interpretation, but does not cite specific external sources or tools (e.g., Bloomberg, Damodaran, published reports). Per the rubric, this general peer/benchmark validation is correct but incomplete, so PARTIAL is appropriate.",
