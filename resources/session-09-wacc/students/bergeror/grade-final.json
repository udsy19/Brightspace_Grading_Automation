  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the correct WACC formula and component formulas, applies them with consistent inputs (e.g., Re = 11.65%, after-tax Rd = 4.58%, weights ≈93%/6%) and computes WACC (11.22%), then interprets sensitivity and leverage implications. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student accurately stated the CAPM formula, supplied the numeric inputs (4.5% risk-free, 5.5% MRP, beta 1.3) and computed Re = 11.65%, then applied and interpreted that result in the WACC analysis, demonstrating a thorough, correct treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly stated the after-tax cost-of-debt formula, used appropriate inputs to compute Rd(1−Tc)=4.58%, applied that value in the WACC calculations, and discussed the tax-shield mechanism and its implications for leverage—demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding of the concept.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student computed WACC components and applied them correctly (evidence of Implement and Validate), but did not show explicit, verifiable technical implementation (no step-by-step substitution, code/run statements, or block-level ownership). Under the strict technical standard this supports a PARTIAL score.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student states the CAPM formula and reports a computed Re, the submission lacks the strict technical evidence required (no code, no \"I ran/verified\" statements, no block-by-block explanation, and explicit AI collaboration referenced). Under the STRICT technical standard, this omission fails the criterion.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly defined the market-value weight formulas and applied them to compute current and pro forma debt/equity weights (evidence of Implement and Validate). However, under the STRICT technical requirement they did not provide explicit technical execution (no \"I ran/verified\" statements, code, or step-by-step calculation work), so the work demonstrates correct application but lacks the required explicit implementation/ownership details, yielding PARTIAL.",
