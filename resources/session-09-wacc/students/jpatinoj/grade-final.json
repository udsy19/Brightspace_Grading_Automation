  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly states the WACC formula and component definitions, computes numeric cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, and market-value weights, and applies sensitivity and project-specific examples. This is a thorough, applied treatment meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly states the CAPM formula, provides numeric inputs (beta, risk-free rate, MRP) and computes cost of equity (11.65%), then applies it to multiple project-specific scenarios showing sensitivity and implications. This demonstrates a thorough, applied understanding meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defines the after‑tax cost of debt formula, supplies inputs (5.8% yield, 21% tax) and reports computed after‑tax values, then applies sensitivity (8% yield) and discusses the tax‑shield tradeoff. This applied treatment with numeric examples and reflection meets the PASS standard.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies the WACC formula and reports numerical component calculations from Python/Colab, demonstrating partial technical implementation. However, under the STRICT requirement they did not provide explicit evidence of personal execution (no \"I ran this code and verified\" or block‑by‑block code explanation), so full credit for technical implementation cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly specifies the CAPM formula, provides inputs, and reports a numeric CAPM result, showing conceptual and applied understanding. However, under the STRICT technical standard they do not explicitly demonstrate personal code execution, block‑by‑block explanation, or verification steps in the transcript, so full technical credit cannot be awarded.\n- Technical Implementation: The student explicitly states they used market values and reports numeric equity/debt weights, demonstrating correct conceptual approach. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not show explicit personal execution steps, data sourcing or block‑by‑block code verification (e.g., \"I ran this code and verified...\"), so the implementation is only partially demonstrated.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover/Define (clearly frames the Netflix investment question and need for a discount rate), Implement (states tools used and reports numeric results and scenarios), Validate/Evolve/Reflect (compares peers, runs sensitivity, interprets WACC as a hurdle and strategic decision input).",
      "reasoning": "The video presents a clear structure, explains methodology, reports computed results, and interprets implications for decision‑making—demonstrating substantive understanding. Verbal hesitations are present but do not undermine the clarity or completeness of the presentation, so it meets the PASS standard."
