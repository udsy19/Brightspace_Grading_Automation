  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM and computed a cost of equity consistent with Rf + beta*MRP, calculated after-tax cost of debt and market-value weights, and produced current and pro forma WACC figures with interpretation. Their implementation and reflection show a thorough, coherent understanding of WACC components and implications, meeting the PASS standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated after-tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−21%)=4.58%) and applied it in WACC with market-value weights, producing a pro forma WACC that falls due to the tax shield. They also explicitly interpreted the tax-shield benefit and its impact on financing decisions, demonstrating accurate and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computed the after-tax cost of debt (5.8%*(1−21%) ≈ 4.58%), applied it in the WACC calculation, and explicitly attributed the WACC reduction to the tax shield, demonstrating both the mechanics and the economic effect. This shows accurate and applied understanding of interest deductibility reducing effective cost of debt.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly applied CAPM inputs and produced the right numeric cost of equity (11.65%) and used it in WACC, showing correct implementation. However the treatment is basic (minor verbal slip in the formula and no deeper discussion of beta choice, MRP justification, or sensitivity), so it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC as the firmwide hurdle rate for the $5B investment and acknowledges the need for higher project-specific rates for riskier projects. However, the treatment is brief and lacks deeper guidance or examples on adjusting discount rates for different project risk profiles, so it meets a correct but not thorough standard.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student shows formula use and reports results (Represent/Implement/Validate), they do not provide the explicit methodological detail, code/run verification, step‑by‑step execution, or ownership required by this STRICT technical category (no flowchart, no block-by-block explanation, no evidence of personal execution).
