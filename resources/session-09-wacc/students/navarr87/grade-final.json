You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly computed WACC components (CAPM cost of equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights), implemented lever/unlever beta adjustments, and performed sensitivity and peer validation. The treatment is detailed, applied to scenarios (additional debt) and interpreted strategically, meeting the threshold for a thorough PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly implemented CAPM with stated inputs and produced numeric cost-of-equity results (11.65% current, 11.73% after relevering). They also encapsulated CAPM in their model, used it in leverage analysis, and ran sensitivity checks, demonstrating a thorough and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly calculated the after-tax cost of debt, encoded it as a model function, applied it in leverage scenarios, and explicitly interpreted the resulting tax-shield benefit on WACC. The implementation and strategic interpretation demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Following the DRIVER Framework: The student performed peer comparisons with specific competitor WACC figures and explained why differences are plausible, showing meaningful validation effort. However, they did not cite external sources or tools for the peer numbers (only referred to them as \"given\"), so the verification lacks explicit external-source attribution required for a full PASS.",

        "\"Hello, my name is Jorge Navarro and this video presentation is a walkthrough of my Cost of Capital analysis for Netflix, structured using the DRIVER framework.\"",

        "\"So in summary, Netflix should issue the debt, use project-specific discount rates, and treat its content portfolio as a set of differentiated investments rather than a single homogeneous project.\""

      "driver_alignment": "The presentation explicitly followed DRIVER stages—Discover (problem statement and inputs), Represent (model/functions described), Implement (numeric results reported), Validate/Evolve/Reflect (sensitivity, peer comparison, and recommendations)—demonstrating organized, stage-by-stage communication.",
      "reasoning": "The video transcript shows a clear, well-structured walkthrough: objectives stated, methodological steps and functions explained, intermediate numeric outputs given, sensitivity and peer validation discussed, and actionable conclusions presented. This coherent organization and substantive explanation meet the standard for an effective presentation."
