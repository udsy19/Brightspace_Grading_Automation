  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly explains the WACC formula and its components (weights, cost of equity via CAPM, after‑tax cost of debt) and implements them with numeric examples and a sensitivity analysis. Reflection on assumptions and tradeoffs (tax shield vs. rising distress costs) demonstrates depth and applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and implements CAPM, provides numeric inputs and a computed cost of equity (11.665%), and demonstrates applied sensitivity (changing beta) and reflection on implications. This shows a thorough, applied understanding meeting PASS criteria.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the after‑tax cost‑of‑debt formula, computes the numeric after‑tax rate (~4.58%), implements it in code, and explains the tax shield's effect on WACC while acknowledging limits (financial distress). This thorough, applied treatment meets PASS criteria.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly implemented CAPM conceptually, provided inputs, and ran code producing a numerical cost‑of‑equity, demonstrating partial technical execution. However, they did not provide block‑by‑block explanation or explicit ownership of code (they relied on Gemini for code generation and gave only a high‑level description), so the strict technical standard for full PASS is not met.\n- Technical Implementation: The student supplies clear market‑value numbers and uses them in the implemented WACC calculation (partial technical execution). However, they do not explicitly show how those market values were determined or sourced (no calculation, data source, or block‑by‑block justification), nor full ownership/detail required by the strict standard, so the result is PARTIAL.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly planned, implemented, ran, and interpreted a sensitivity analysis (debt sweep and plotted WACC), showing correct execution and reflection. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide block‑by‑block explanations or full ownership of the AI‑generated code (relied on Gemini without detailed walkthrough), so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

      "driver_alignment": "Discover: defined the goal to evaluate WACC under varying leverage.  \nImplement: executed a systematic sensitivity sweep (debt levels 0–100bn) and computed WACC changes.  \nReflect: interpreted results, quantified effects (WACC drop from 11.22% to 11.13%), discussed tax‑shield benefits and rising financial‑distress costs, and recommended strategy.",
      "reasoning": "The student logically explains the trade‑off (cheap after‑tax debt vs. rising distress costs), demonstrates it with a sensitivity analysis and numerical examples, and explicitly identifies the optimal‑structure concept and its limits. This coherent presentation and evidence‑based recommendation satisfy PASS."

That combination of clear framing, stepwise implementation description, results, and reflective judgement demonstrates effective presentation and understanding."
