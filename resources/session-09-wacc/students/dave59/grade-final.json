  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student clearly defined the WACC components and formulas, implemented them in code to produce numeric WACC results, and demonstrated deeper analysis via peer benchmarking and sensitivity simulations. These elements show comprehensive, applied understanding of WACC consistent with a thorough treatment.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined and implemented the CAPM cost-of-equity formula, supplied and used appropriate inputs (risk-free rate, market premium, beta), and interpreted the result (higher cost due to beta=1.3) within the broader WACC analysis. This shows a thorough, applied understanding consistent with a PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student explicitly defined and implemented the after-tax cost-of-debt in their represent/implement stages, explained the tax-deductibility rationale, and quantified the financing savings from added debt—demonstrating applied understanding of the tax shield and its impact on WACC. This combined conceptual explanation and numeric application meets the thoroughness required for a PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly defined WACC components, provided code-based implementation, and reported concrete numeric outputs—showing partial technical correctness. Under the STRICT technical standard, they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-level comprehension, or ownership (detailed function-by-function explanation and \"I ran/verified\" language), so the work meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student clearly defined and implemented CAPM in their WACC engine and interpreted results, showing correct conceptual and applied use. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution (e.g., \"I ran/verified the code\"), nor provide block-by-block explanations or ownership of AI output—so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student identified and fed market-value equity and debt inputs into their WACC engine and reported resulting weights (≈6% debt), showing correct conceptual use. However, under the STRICT technical standard they did not explicitly demonstrate personal execution, block-by-block code explanation, or explicit verification language (\"I ran/verified\"), so the implementation is credible but not fully evidenced — therefore PARTIAL.",

      "driver_alignment": "The presentation explicitly follows DRIVER: Discover (states goals and required inputs), Represent (maps CAPM, after‑tax debt, weights into formulas), Implement (references code and execution), Validate (benchmarks vs peers), Evolve (runs sensitivity/debt-ratio simulations), and Reflect (translates results into recommendations).",
      "reasoning": "The video delivers a clear, structured walkthrough of the WACC methodology—identifying inputs, mapping formulas into code, executing analyses, benchmarking results, running sensitivity scenarios, and giving quantitative recommendations—demonstrating thorough understanding and effective communication consistent with a PASS."
