  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 5 stages: D, R, I, V, E.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly identifies and applies WACC components (CAPM for equity, after-tax cost of debt, market-value weights) and provides numeric examples and sensitivity (new debt, geography-specific betas). They also validate results by recomputing with changed capital structure, demonstrating thorough and applied understanding.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula, provides numeric calculations for both firm-level and project-specific betas, and uses those equity costs in WACC computations. The multiple examples (overall firm and US-specific) and numeric results demonstrate a thorough, applied understanding of CAPM.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly computes the after-tax cost of debt with given yield and tax rate, applies it in the WACC formula, and demonstrates the tax-shield benefit by recomputing WACC after new debt issuance. These steps show accurate conceptual and applied understanding of cost of debt and its impact on firm value.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student applies the correct formulas and reports results, this STRICT technical criterion requires explicit personal execution evidence (code/tests, block‑by‑block verification, flowchart or documented run-through) and clear ownership. The submission provides verbal calculations and approximate results (\"roughly\") but no explicit implementation, verification steps, code, or artifacts to demonstrate rigorous, defendable technical execution.\n- Technical Implementation: Although the student correctly states and applies the CAPM formula and gives numeric results, this is a STRICT technical criterion requiring explicit implementation evidence (personal execution, code/tests, block‑by‑block verification, or documented run‑through). The submission contains only verbal calculations and no artifacts or explicit demonstration of having run/validated an implementation, so it fails the technical implementation standard.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly reports market-value inputs and arithmetic weights, but this STRICT technical criterion requires explicit implementation evidence (personal execution, code/tests, block‑by‑block verification, or documented run‑through). The submission contains only stated results and no artifacts or explicit demonstration of execution/verification, so it fails the technical implementation requirement.",

The explanation is specific and applied, meeting the threshold for a thorough, understandable methodology."

However, the discussion lacks balanced depth on the costs/risks of additional leverage (e.g., bankruptcy/coverage risk, flexibility), so the treatment is correct and applied but not fully comprehensive."
