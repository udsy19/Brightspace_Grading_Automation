  "feedback": "Excellent application of the DRIVER framework throughout your work. You clearly demonstrated 6 stages: D, R, I, V, E, R2.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student demonstrates a thorough, correct treatment of WACC: defined formula and components, computed cost of equity via CAPM, computed after‑tax cost of debt, used market-value weights, performed unlever/relever beta adjustments, ran sensitivity analysis and applied results to strategic recommendations. The combination of clear formulas, numeric calculations, code implementation and interpretation meets the standards for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly states and applies CAPM (risk-free + beta × MRP), computes the cost of equity numerically (11.65%) and recomputes it after unlevering/relevering beta (≈11.73%), and implements this in code with sensitivity checks. The treatment is detailed, numerically accurate, and connected to WACC implications, meeting the threshold for PASS.\n- Financial Concepts Accuracy: The student correctly defines and numerically computes the after‑tax cost of debt (5.8% × (1−0.21) = 4.58%), implements it in code for the WACC, and explicitly cites the tax‑shield benefit in peer comparison and strategic implications. Coverage is technically accurate, applied to WACC, and interpreted strategically, meeting the standards for PASS.\n\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n- Technical Implementation: The student implemented the WACC calculation, described the components and showed manual numeric computations and claimed the code outputs matched those hand checks, demonstrating partial technical execution and validation. However, they did not provide explicit, block‑by‑block explanation of the code, nor an explicit statement of personally running and stepping through each code block (required under the strict rubric), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly applies CAPM, shows numeric calculations for cost of equity and for unlever/relevering beta, and claims code validation — demonstrating technical understanding. However, under the strict implementation standard they did not provide an explicit block‑by‑block code walkthrough or an unambiguous personal execution statement (e.g., \"I ran each cell, inspected outputs, and debugged X\"), so the submission meets PARTIAL rather than PASS.\n- Technical Implementation: The student correctly computes and reports market‑value weights (E=200bn, D=13bn, V=213bn → 93.9% equity, 6.1% debt) and indicates code was used and validated against hand work. However, under the strict technical standard they did not provide an explicit block‑by‑block code walkthrough or an unambiguous personal execution statement (e.g., stepwise cell runs, function explanations), so the evidence supports PARTIAL rather than PASS.",

Implement — ran scenarios (current vs. +$3B debt), computed numeric impacts on KE and WACC. Reflect — discussed strategic trade‑offs (lower WACC vs. higher bankruptcy risk, reduced flexibility) and recommended target leverage.",
      "reasoning": "The student presents a clear, logical trade‑off: quantitatively shows how additional debt lowers WACC but raises equity risk and cost of equity, explains why the net WACC effect is small given Netflix's equity dominance, and states practical cons (bankruptcy risk, flexibility, credit rating). This combination of math, scenario implementation, and strategic implications demonstrates a thorough, well‑organized presentation of capital‑structure trade‑offs."

Minor verbal slips do not detract from overall clarity and the presentation would allow a reviewer to follow, reproduce, and defend the analysis."
