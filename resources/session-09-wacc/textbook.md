# Session 9: The Cost of Capital (WACC)

*What's the "hurdle rate" a company must clear to make its investors happy?*

---

## Section 1: The Financial Hook - The CFO's Dilemma

You're the newly appointed CFO of TechForward Inc. The CEO presents three major strategic initiatives, each requiring \$100 million investment:

**Project Alpha:** AI research lab promising 15% annual returns
**Project Beta:** Manufacturing expansion with 12% projected returns  
**Project Gamma:** International expansion targeting 9% returns

"Which projects should we fund?" the CEO asks. "We can afford two of them."

Your finance training screams: "Compare returns to cost of capital!" But what exactly is TechForward's cost of capital?

**The Capital Structure Challenge:**
```
TechForward's Financing:
40% Equity (stockholders demand ??? return)
60% Debt (bonds currently yield 6%)

Blended Cost = ???

Project Evaluation:
Alpha (15%) vs. Cost of Capital (???)
Beta (12%) vs. Cost of Capital (???)  
Gamma (9%) vs. Cost of Capital (???)
```

Sessions 6-7 taught you how markets price individual securities. Now you need to determine what return TechForward must earn to satisfy both debt and equity investors simultaneously—the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

This is where all your valuation tools converge: CAPM for equity costs, bond pricing for debt costs, and market efficiency ensuring these rates reflect true investor requirements.

**AI Learning Support - WACC Integration with Previous Frameworks**

**Learning Goal:** Master how WACC synthesizes all previous financial concepts into a unified corporate finance decision-making framework.

**💼 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm studying WACC as the integration point for Sessions 1-7: TVM provides the discounting mechanism, CAPM determines equity cost, bond pricing gives debt cost, portfolio theory explains diversification benefits, and market efficiency ensures these costs reflect true investor requirements. My understanding is that WACC transforms market-based investor requirements into actionable corporate hurdle rates for capital allocation decisions. I want to explore the practical challenges: How do CFOs handle estimation uncertainty in WACC components? What happens when market conditions change rapidly? How do they validate that their WACC calculations appropriately reflect the company's cost of capital for different business units or projects?"*

## Section 2: Foundational Concepts & Formulas

### Part I: The Logic of Blended Capital Costs

**WACC Principle:** A company's cost of capital equals the weighted average of its debt and equity costs, reflecting the blended return requirement of all capital providers.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Cost of Equity (rₑ):** Return required by shareholders (often calculated using CAPM)
- **Cost of Debt (rᵨ):** After-tax interest rate on company's debt
- **Market Value Weights:** Proportion of total capital from each source
- **Tax Shield:** Interest payments reduce taxes, lowering effective debt cost
- **Hurdle Rate:** Minimum return required for positive NPV projects

### Part II: The WACC Formula

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital:**
$$WACC = \frac{E}{V} \times r_e + \frac{D}{V} \times r_d \times (1-T)$$

*Where:*
- E = Market value of equity
- D = Market value of debt  
- V = E + D (total firm value)
- rₑ = Cost of equity
- rᵨ = Pre-tax cost of debt
- T = Corporate tax rate

**Component Calculations:**
$$r_e = R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f) \text{ (using CAPM)}$$
$$r_d = \text{Current yield on company bonds or comparable debt}$$

### Part III: Market Value vs. Book Value Weights

**Timeline for Capital Structure Analysis:**
```
Historical: Book values -----> Current decisions -----> Future financing
           Balance sheet      WACC calculation          Capital structure

Market-Based: Current stock price -----> Current bond prices -----> Market value weights
              Equity market value        Debt market value         True investor demands
```

**Market Value Calculation:**
- **Equity Value:** Shares outstanding × Current stock price
- **Debt Value:** Current market value of bonds (may differ from face value)
- **Preferred Stock:** Market value if applicable

### Part IV: Integration with Previous Sessions

**WACC's Foundation in Prior Learning:**
```
Session 2: TVM provided discount rate mechanics
Session 3-4: Equity and debt valuation methods  
Session 6: Risk-return relationship fundamentals
Session 7: CAPM for systematic cost of equity calculation
Session 8: Market efficiency ensures rates reflect true costs
Session 9: WACC combines all elements for corporate decision-making
```

**Corporate Application Timeline:**
```
Sessions 2-8: Learn to value individual securities
              ↓
Session 9: Determine company's cost of capital  
           ↓

## Section 3: The Gym - Partner Practice

### Round 1: Solo Practice (10 minutes)

**Problem 1 (Basic WACC):** Company has \$500M equity (β = 1.2), \$300M debt (6% yield). Risk-free rate = 3%, market return = 10%, tax rate = 25%. Calculate WACC.

**Capital Structure:**
```
Equity: \$500M at 12% cost (using CAPM)
Debt: \$300M at 6% pre-tax cost
Total: \$800M

WACC = Weighted average of component costs
```

**Problem 2 (Market vs. Book Values):** Book values: \$200M equity, \$100M debt. Stock price suggests market equity value of \$350M. Debt trades at 95% of face value. How do weights change?

**AI Learning Support - WACC Components and Market Value Weighting**

**Learning Goal:** Master the critical importance of market value weights and understand why WACC reflects current investor expectations rather than historical accounting values.

**💼 Professional Prompt Sample A (Grade: A):**
*"I'm analyzing WACC component calculations and understand that we use market values rather than book values for capital structure weights. My reasoning is that market values reflect current investor expectations and opportunity costs, while book values represent historical accounting data that may not reflect true economic value. This creates practical challenges: market values fluctuate daily, debt may trade above or below par, and private companies lack market prices. How do corporate treasurers handle market value estimation for WACC calculations? What methods do they use when market data is unavailable or unreliable? How frequently should companies recalculate WACC given market volatility?"*

**🎯 Why This Shows Professional Corporate Finance Skills:**
- ✅ **Market vs. book understanding**: Shows sophisticated grasp of valuation principles
- ✅ **Practical implementation awareness**: Demonstrates understanding of real-world challenges
- ✅ **Estimation methodology interest**: Seeks professional best practices
- ✅ **Dynamic market recognition**: Shows awareness of market volatility impact

**😕 Weak Prompt Sample (Grade: D):**
*"Why do we use market values instead of book values for WACC? What's the difference?"*

**💀 Why This Destroys Your Corporate Finance Credibility:**
- ❌ **No conceptual foundation**: Shows zero understanding of market vs. accounting principles
- ❌ **Basic inquiry level**: Cannot handle professional-level analysis
- ❌ **No practical awareness**: Misses implementation challenges
- ❌ **Simplistic thinking**: Lacks sophisticated financial reasoning

**🚀 Your Professional Excellence Challenge:** Transform this into a prompt that demonstrates the market-based valuation and practical implementation skills that corporate treasurers and CFOs require.

### Round 2: Peer Teaching (15 minutes)
- Person A explains WACC calculation and why market values matter for weights
- Person B explains the tax shield effect and after-tax cost of debt
- Both discuss how WACC changes with capital structure decisions

### Round 3: Challenge Problems (15 minutes)

**Problem 3 (Multiple Debt Sources):** Company has:
- \$200M bank loan at 5%
- \$300M bonds trading at 102% of par, 6% coupon
- \$500M equity with β = 1.1
- Risk-free rate = 4%, market return = 9%, tax rate = 30%

**Problem 4 (Changing Capital Structure):** Current WACC = 10% with 40% debt. Company issues more debt to reach 60% debt ratio. New debt costs 7% vs. current 5%. Equity beta rises from 1.2 to 1.6. Calculate new WACC.

**Problem 5 (Project-Specific Risk):** Company WACC = 9%, but new project is in different risk category. Comparable companies have average β = 1.5 vs. company β = 1.0. Should project use company WACC or adjusted rate?

### Debrief Discussion
Why might companies prefer debt over equity financing despite bankruptcy risk?

## Section 4: The Coaching - Your DRIVER Learning Guide

Let's work through a comprehensive WACC calculation for a real company, connecting market-based costs to corporate decision-making.

> **Case Scenario for Coaching:** Retail expansion decision. MegaStore Corp considers     \$50M warehouse project. Current financing: 2 million shares at \$75 each, \$80M bonds trading at 96% of par with 5.5% coupon. Company β = 1.3, risk-free rate = 3.5%, market return = 9.5%, tax rate = 28%. Project expected to generate 11% returns.

**Decision Framework:**
```
Calculate WACC -----> Compare to Project Return -----> Investment Decision
Market-based costs   \$11 project return             Accept if Return > WACC
```

### The DRIVER Playbook in Action

#### D - Discover: Frame the Corporate Cost of Capital
**Goal:** Systematically determine MegaStore's blended capital cost.
**Action:** Use AI to structure comprehensive WACC analysis.

**✅ DO THIS with AI:**
```
"Act as a corporate treasurer calculating cost of capital for investment decisions.
Company data: 2M shares at \$75, \$80M bonds at 96% of par yielding 5.5%, β = 1.3, Rf = 3.5%, Rm = 9.5%, tax = 28%.
Before calculating, help me understand: Why do we use market values rather than book values for WACC calculations?"
```

**❌ DON'T DO THIS:**
- "Calculate MegaStore's WACC for me"
- "Tell me if they should do the project"

**Outcome:** Need to use current market values to reflect what investors actually demand today, then weight equity and debt costs by their market value proportions. This gives forward-looking cost of capital for current investment decisions.

#### R - Represent: Map the Capital Cost Components
**Goal:** Visualize how different capital sources combine into blended cost.
**Action:** Create framework showing WACC calculation methodology.

```
Capital Structure Analysis:

Equity Component:
Market Value = 2M shares × \$75 = \$150M
Cost of Equity = 3.5% + 1.3 × (9.5% - 3.5%) = 11.3%

Debt Component:  
Market Value = \$80M × 0.96 = \$76.8M
After-tax Cost = 5.5% × (1 - 0.28) = 3.96%

Total Capital Value = \$150M + \$76.8M = \$226.8M

WACC Calculation:
Equity Weight = \$150M ÷ \$226.8M = 66.1%
Debt Weight = \$76.8M ÷ \$226.8M = 33.9%

WACC = 66.1% × 11.3% + 33.9% × 3.96% = ?
```

**✅ DO THIS with AI:**

### A Note on Learning

WACC is where finance theory meets corporate strategy. It's the hurdle rate for investments, the benchmark for performance, and a window into how companies think about risk and return.

Your analysis reveals the tradeoffs companies face: cheaper debt comes with constraints, equity provides flexibility but dilutes owners. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for corporate finance.

**Remember: WACC isn't just a number - it's the minimum return a company must earn to satisfy all its investors. Master this, and you understand the essence of corporate finance.**

## Appendix - Solutions to "The Gym" Exercises

**Problem 1:** 
- Cost of equity = 3% + 1.2 × (10% - 3%) = **11.4%**
- WACC = (500/800) × 11.4% + (300/800) × 6% × (1-0.25) = 7.125% + 1.688% = **8.81%**

**Problem 2:** 
- Book value weights: 67% equity, 33% debt
- Market value weights: 79% equity (350/445), 21% debt (95/445)
- Market weights better reflect current investor requirements

**Problem 3:**
- Bank loan: \$200M at 5%
- Bonds: \$306M market value (300 × 1.02) at 6%
- Total debt: \$506M, Weighted debt cost = [(200×5%) + (306×6%)] / 506 = 5.59%
- Cost of equity = 4% + 1.1 × (9% - 4%) = 9.5%
- WACC = (500/1006) × 9.5% + (506/1006) × 5.59% × (1-0.30) = **6.7%**

**Problem 4:**
- Current: Cost of equity = Rf + 1.2 × MRP, WACC = 10%
- New: Cost of equity = Rf + 1.6 × MRP (higher beta due to leverage)
- Higher debt weight (60% vs 40%) but higher costs due to financial risk
- New WACC depends on specific risk-free rate and market premium values

**Problem 5:** Use project-specific WACC adjusted for risk. If comparable companies average β = 1.5 vs company β = 1.0, adjust discount rate upward to reflect higher systematic risk of this project type.

**Final Note:** This session established your expertise in determining market-based cost of capital for corporate investment decisions. You now understand how investor expectations translate into corporate hurdle rates, completing your foundation for advanced corporate finance applications.
